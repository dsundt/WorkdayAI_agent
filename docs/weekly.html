<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>This week marks a strategic acceleration in AI-driven HR, HCM, and agentic enterprise architecture. Workday sustains its Gartner Cloud ERP leadership. European clients push toward AI optimization. New product launches and research from Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, and UKG signal both fierce SI/GSI competition and the need for rapid upskilling and client enablement around agentic AI, workforce transformation, and digital org design. Client expectations for AI co-piloting and extensibility are now front and center—demanding Deloitte’s swift action.</p>
