<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday AI Agents and Ecosystem Accelerate Real-World Adoption (Week of Jan 24–31, 2026)</strong><br>
    Workday’s AI agent portfolio continues rapid evolution (<a href="https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday AI Agents</a>). These agents orchestrate not only analytics, but full HR/finance workflows, leveraging curated skills and ML/LLMs for hands-off transaction automation. Marketplace modules (e.g. <a href="https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/762204/sapiaai-for-workday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sapia.ai</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/537021/real-time-employee-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-Time Employee Benchmarks</a>) enable accelerated integration of agentic solutions. This cements Workday’s ambition to become a launchpad for agentic HR transformation, meaning Deloitte must drive client upskilling, AI lifecycle controls, and differentiated process redesign.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP Joule Platform Brings Low/No-Code Agent Creation to HCM/ERP (Jan 2026)</strong><br>
    SAP’s <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/joule-studio-create-joule-skills-and-agents-without-coding-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil/ev-p/14317678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joule Studio</a> puts low/no-code agent development in end users’ hands, supported by extensive community enablement. Templates, skills libraries, and audit support ease self-service agent creation for HR, compliance, and onboarding. Deloitte must benchmark extensibility and governance between SAP and Workday—client demand for transparency and auditability is now non-negotiable.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Bias & Compliance Risks Emerge as Top Regulatory Concern for HR SaaS (Jan 2026)</strong><br>
    US/EU regulators, via EEOC, <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-AI-audit-guide-race-gender-discrimination/650640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HR Dive</a>, and <a href="https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/employment-law-compliance/eeoc-issues-guidance-use-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHRM</a>, published new guidance on auditing, explainability, and bias control in algorithmic HR/AI systems. Lawsuits and settlements set new expectations for vendors and integrators. For Deloitte, embedding AI compliance, documentation, and model lifecycle governance is now a business imperative on every engagement.</li>
  <li><strong>Sapia.ai and Real-Time Benchmarking in the Workday Marketplace Expand Cross-Vendor AI Integrations (Updated Jan 30, 2026)</strong><br>
    Marketplace additions show Workday expanding plug-and-play agent-driven modules. <a href="https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/762204/sapiaai-for-workday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sapia.ai</a> covers unbiased recruitment, while <a href="https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/537021/real-time-employee-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-Time Employee Benchmarks</a> enables dynamic workforce planning. These shrink time-to-value but require robust integration management and continuous compliance updates—areas where Deloitte can differentiate.</li>
  <li><strong>Generative & Agentic AI Evaluation: Cost, Control, and CIO Anxiety (Jan 29–30, 2026)</strong><br>
    As highlighted by <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4123029/ai-agent-evaluations-the-hidden-cost-of-deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIO.com</a>, AI agent adoption drives lifecycle management costs (evaluation, drift, explainability) that surprise many organizations. The CIO’s 2026 agenda (see <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4123754/the-cios-agenda-in-2026-from-exploration-to-responsibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIO.com</a>) is defined by balancing innovation speed with operational control, making cost modeling and operational readiness core differentiators for Deloitte.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Workday sharpened its vision for agent-embedded workflows, rapidly expanding its capabilities and third-party plugin support.</li>
  <li>SAP doubled down on democratizing AI agent development, setting new self-service and auditability expectations.</li>
  <li>Regulatory guardrails for HR-focused AI agents solidified, with auditing and fairness becoming board-level risks for SaaS buyers and implementors.</li>
  <li>Clients express growing concern over the cost, complexity, and compliance of embedding AI in core HR/finance operations.</li>
  <li>Integration, benchmarking, and bias mitigation are now front and center in sales and implementation cycles—clients are requesting proof of compliant agent design and operation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP</strong>: Advanced its Joule Studio platform, democratizing agent creation. This pushes Deloitte to guide Workday clients on low-code extensibility and strong AI governance (<a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/joule-studio-create-joule-skills-and-agents-without-coding-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil/ev-p/14317678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Joule Studio Event</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Remains prominently positioned by Gartner as HCM leader, but with ongoing cost-cut strategies (layoffs) to fund AI expansion. Deloitte can target displaced Oracle clients seeking stability and faster innovation in Workday agent ecosystems.</li>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>: Released robust HR AI connectors and employee analytics (Jan 2026), increasing pressure on Workday’s platform value. Deloitte should reinforce Workday’s depth in decisioning and complete workflow automation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Map current client agentic AI pilots and catalog integration needs/opportunities with Workday Marketplace modules.</li>
  <li>Launch internal Deloitte workshop for cross-practice agent lifecycle and AI compliance enablement.</li>
  <li>Evaluate competitive messaging against SAP Joule and Oracle based on recent product and regulatory updates.</li>
  <li>Develop field guides for AI audit documentation tailored to US and EU regulatory expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Client confusion and integration failure as agentic modules multiply.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Create an agentic AI catalog and staged rollout framework for clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Regulatory/reputational exposure from biased/opaque AI.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Implement mandatory checkpoints for transparency and fairness review.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Rising cost and scope creep from ongoing agent evaluation.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Model and monitor AI agent TCO and embed operations controls.</li>

Deloitte teams must pivot to client guidance on agentic enablement, competitive positioning against SAP and Oracle, and readiness for new HR AI compliance risks.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday AI Agents and Ecosystem Accelerate Real-World Adoption (Week of Jan 24–31, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday continued rolling out expanded AI agent capabilities as highlighted on their dedicated pages (see https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html and https://www.workday.com/en-ch/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html). These agents now automate a broader range of HR and financial workflows and leverage embedded machine learning, LLMs, and curated skills. The focus is on end-to-end workflow orchestration—AI agents can pre-process data, recommend actions, and even complete transactional tasks with oversight, enabling HR and finance leaders to move beyond alerts toward true operational automation. Ecosystem partners (Sapia.ai, OptiWorkforce, Real-time Employee Benchmarks) reinforce this, providing plug-and-play agent-based modules on Workday Marketplace.\\n\\nThis shift signals Workday’s intent to serve as a springboard for agentic AI across enterprise workflows—not just for data insights but for actionable, trusted decisioning. For Deloitte, this means client conversations around workforce planning, efficiency, and controls must now weave in agentic AI lifecycle governance, skills enablement, and business process redesign. It also sharpens competitive pressure versus SAP Joule and Oracle, emphasizing the need for upskilling and accelerators in Deloitte’s practice.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Joule Platform Brings Low/No-Code Agent Creation to HCM/ERP (Jan 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s Joule Studio (see https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/joule-studio-create-joule-skills-and-agents-without-coding-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil/ev-p/14317678 and https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/Joule+Studio/pd-p/2a5c5654-c2ac-414e-aaff-335367ed0215) is gaining traction in the SAP SuccessFactors ecosystem. This approach empowers users to create custom agents without extensive coding—leveraging built-in templates, skills libraries, and guardrails for compliance and bias mitigation. The result is faster prototyping and adoption of process agents (for onboarding, compliance, etc.). SAP’s community is rolling out best practices and hands-on sessions for activating Joule, with a growing focus on reporting, explainability, and scaling.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday teams, SAP’s investment in end-user agent enablement and transparent controls raises the table stakes: clients demand self-service extensibility of agentic AI that is auditable, compliant, and can rapidly evolve with business needs. The approach also signals where the competitive narrative is heading: from black-box AI toward collaborative, transparent, and co-created automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/joule-studio-create-joule-skills-and-agents-without-coding-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil/ev-p/14317678\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI Bias &amp; Compliance Risks Emerge as Top Regulatory Concern for HR SaaS (Jan 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;An array of EEOC, HR Dive, and SHRM updates (see https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-AI-audit-guide-race-gender-discrimination/650640 and https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/employment-law-compliance/eeoc-issues-guidance-use-ai) show US and EU regulators intensifying focus on algorithmic transparency, auditability and bias in AI-driven HR and HCM systems. Released guidance covers how HR vendors and clients should proactively audit their AI models, clarify disparate impact risks, and ensure explainability for automated decisions. Settlements and new cases highlight expectations for both vendors (like Workday) and system integrators to model robust governance, traceability, and fairness mechanisms—escalating the compliance bar for agentic SaaS adoption.\\n\\nFor Deloitte, this signals critical demand for AI compliance services: solution assessments, audit program design, and change management. The regulatory environment is growing more prescriptive, meaning Deloitte’s Workday practice must actively embed audit-ready AI processes and bias testing into every implementation and advisory engagement.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-AI-audit-guide-race-gender-discrimination/650640\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Sapia.ai and Real-Time Benchmarking in the Workday Marketplace Expand Cross-Vendor AI Integrations (Updated Jan 30, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;The addition and maturation of agent-driven modules in Workday Marketplace (e.g. Sapia.ai for recruitment—https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/762204/sapiaai-for-workday and Real-Time Employee Benchmarks—https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/537021/real-time-employee-benchmarks) signal a marketplace-driven future for agentic HR. Sapia.ai embeds conversational AI and unbiased candidate assessment tools directly into talent workflows, while OptiWorkforce and benchmarking apps enable dynamic, AI-powered workforce planning and performance management. These modules accelerate time to value, especially for mid-market and global organizations needing best-in-breed yet tightly integrated solutions.\\n\\nDeloitte can harness these ready-built, rapidly evolving modules to drive faster client outcomes, enable benchmarking, and focus on consulting value-add, rather than infrastructure. This also raises strategic advisory needs around connectivity, vendor risk, and continuous agent lifecycle management.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/762204/sapiaai-for-workday\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Generative &amp; Agentic AI Evaluation: Cost, Control, and CIO Anxiety (Jan 29–30, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A cluster of CIO.com articles (https://www.cio.com/article/4123029/ai-agent-evaluations-the-hidden-cost-of-deployment.html and https://www.cio.com/article/4123754/the-cios-agenda-in-2026-from-exploration-to-responsibility.html) highlight rising costs and leadership concerns around agentic AI. While adoption is surging, organizations are surprised by ongoing evaluation and governance costs. Leaders must address prompt reliability, agent drift, and varied real-world performance. Simultaneously, CIOs and CHROs are asked to reconcile innovation with responsibility, requiring robust control and reporting mechanisms. There’s a clear push from experimentation to disciplined, explainable deployment, with cross-functional teams (IT, risk, HR) working in tandem.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday teams: advisory demand will rapidly grow for cost modeling, ROI analysis, and post-deployment AI monitoring frameworks.

For Deloitte, this means prioritizing AI lifecycle governance, skills enablement, and process reengineering. Source: https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html\\n\\n- SAP Joule Platform Brings Low/No-Code Agent Creation to HCM/ERP (Jan 2026): SAP’s Joule Studio now enables business users to create agents using templates and skills libraries, with integrated compliance guardrails. Deloitte must benchmark self-service extensibility and governance capabilities. Source: https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/joule-studio-create-joule-skills-and-agents-without-coding-s%C3%A3o-paulo-brazil/ev-p/14317678\\n\\n- AI Bias &amp; Compliance Risks Emerge as Top Regulatory Concern for HR SaaS (Jan 2026): New US and EU regulatory guidance and enforcement (see: https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-AI-audit-guide-race-gender-discrimination/650640) force SaaS vendors and integrators to provide transparent, auditable, and bias-mitigated agentic AI. Deloitte must package audit, risk, and compliance consulting directly into AI-enabled HR solution implementations. See also: https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/employment-law-compliance/eeoc-issues-guidance-use-ai\\n\\n- Sapia.ai and Real-Time Benchmarking in the Workday Marketplace Expand Cross-Vendor AI Integrations (Updated Jan 30, 2026): Marketplace modules like Sapia.ai and Real-Time Employee Benchmarks enable rapid value realization but increase integration and compliance complexity. Deloitte is positioned to advise on integration management and vendor/AI lifecycle risk. Source: https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/762204/sapiaai-for-workday\\n\\n- Generative &amp; Agentic AI Evaluation: Cost, Control, and CIO Anxiety (Jan 29–30, 2026): Organizations struggle with growing costs and complexity in agentic AI lifecycle management, as highlighted by CIO.com (https://www.cio.com/article/4123029/ai-agent-evaluations-the-hidden-cost-of-deployment.html and https://www.cio.com/article/4123754/the-cios-agenda-in-2026-from-exploration-to-responsibility.html). Deloitte can differentiate with cost and compliance frameworks.\\n\\nWhat changed this week\\n- Workday ramped up agent-embedded workflow capabilities and third-party integration support.\\n- SAP democratized agent creation with Joule Studio, changing client expectations for no/low-code extensibility.\\n- Regulatory focus on AI bias and compliance became more prescriptive, setting new project standards.\\n- Integration, compliance, and continuous AI lifecycle management became central to SaaS/HCM sales and delivery conversations.\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- SAP: Joule Studio accelerates no-code agentic automation. Deloitte must guide clients on self-service extensibility and governance.
