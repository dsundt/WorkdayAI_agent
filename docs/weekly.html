  <li><strong>Workday Announces New Reston, Virginia Office as Regional Public Sector Hub (Nov. 10, 2025):</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-10-Workday-Announces-New-Reston,-Virginia-Office-to-Serve-as-Regional-Hub-for-Growing-Public-Sector-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday</a> has opened a new office dedicated to serving government agencies, showcasing deep investment in public-sector AI transformation, including secure and extensible agentic AI solutions. This enhances Deloitte's opportunity to offer comprehensive transformation and compliance advisory services, positioning itself as a trusted partner for both technology and regulatory success.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Integration and Data Governance Dominate Enterprise Conversations (Nov. 2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bain</a> and other major analyst sources emphasize the need for trusted, explainable, and compliant agentic AI systems within SaaS. Workday’s accelerate rollout of Illuminate™ and Data Cloud reflects this priority, giving Deloitte new areas to support clients in both innovation and compliance, especially under new risk governance frameworks.</li>
  <li><strong>UKG, Dayforce, and SAP Intensify Agentic AI Competition with Industry-Built Agents (Nov. 2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UKG</a>, Dayforce, and SAP have each rolled out agentic automation features tightly coupled to core HCM/ERP workflows, accelerating market expectations for SaaS agent extensibility. Deloitte must help clients understand relative agent architectures and streamline rapid, real-world agent deployments as competitive pressures grow.</li>
  <li><strong>EY and Deloitte Whitepapers Spotlight Risk, Trust, and Human-Centric Designs for Agentic AI (Nov. 2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_qa/insights/financial-services/emeia/what-risk-leaders-need-to-do-now-about-agentic-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EY</a> and Deloitte publications highlight the requirements for embedding risk governance, transparency, and responsible AI operations into agentic systems.

<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>This week, the agentic AI landscape in SaaS matured further, with the spotlight on both capability expansion and ecosystem readiness. Workday’s public sector expansion underscores strategic regionalization in response to government clients’ unique demands for secure, extensible AI agent deployments. Analyst and consultancy thought leadership converged on the primacy of trusted data, risk management, and compliance frameworks as critical to client adoption, making them top-of-mind in enterprise buying and deployment conversations. Major competitors are now delivering differentiated, industry-vertical AI agents, shifting client expectations from mere AI aspiration to tangible automation ROI. For Deloitte, this means the market is rapidly shifting from discussing agentic AI possibilities to demonstrating and orchestrating enterprise-scale, customizable agent-powered workflows that balance technical innovation and responsible, governed operations.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UKG:</strong> UKG’s <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryte AI agents</a> present direct competition to Workday, focusing on practical HR and workforce automations. Deloitte teams must deepen value mapping and develop playbooks to differentiate agent architecture and rapid ROI in client transformation engagements.</li>
  <li><strong>Dayforce:</strong> With ongoing expansion of <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-ai-assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Agent portfolios</a>, Dayforce is accelerating agent-driven automation in HR, payroll, and benefits. Deloitte must tailor competitive enablement and be ready to compare deployment speed and cost to own across platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP:</strong> <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/recap-sap-teched-2025-discover-manage-and-control-all-your-ai-agents/ba-p/14268291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP’s Joule agent</a> management tooling bolsters their position in multi-agent orchestration. Deloitte teams should be ready to advise clients with both SAP and Workday estates on cross-SaaS, cross-agent strategies and integration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI Governance & Risk Management:</strong> <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_qa/insights/financial-services/emeia/what-risk-leaders-need-to-do-now-about-agentic-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EY’s risk management insight</a> equips teams to advise on robust agentic AI risk control embedding in Workday engagements within 90 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparative Agent Architecture:</strong> <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UKG’s release details</a> can be used to build benchmarking frameworks and demo scripts for tailored industry client engagements.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Sector AI Transformation with Workday:</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-10-Workday-Announces-New-Reston,-Virginia-Office-to-Serve-as-Regional-Hub-for-Growing-Public-Sector-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s regional hub news</a> informs go-to-market and opportunity-playbooks for AI-enhanced government solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Host a cross-vendor agentic AI case study workshop, focusing on Workday, SAP, UKG, and Dayforce.</li>
  <li>Refine enablement materials and demo scripts in light of new UKG and Dayforce agentic feature releases.</li>
  <li>Brief Deloitte public sector teams on how Workday’s Reston hub impacts federal transformation strategy.</li>
  <li>Expand AI governance and risk FAQs for SaaS agent deployments, targeting regulated client sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Commoditization of agentic AI by competitors erodes Workday’s edge.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Elevate Deloitte’s orchestration and compliance capabilities to showcase unique, industry-specific differentiation.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Client hesitation due to regulatory uncertainty.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Build on Deloitte’s advisory track record to lead aggressive client education and hands-on risk governance implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Public sector slow to scale pilots without proven security and value.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Launch outcome-driven, locally-managed proof projects leveraging Workday’s regional support as a pilot accelerator.</li>
</ul>

The focus is on extensibility, trust, industry-ready deployment, and governance—key themes for Deloitte as clients seek actionable, safe, and integrative AI in HCM and ERP environments.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Announces New Reston, Virginia Office as Regional Public Sector Hub (Nov. 10, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s announcement of a new regional office in Reston, Virginia, signals a targeted investment in public sector digital transformation, reinforcing the company’s commitment to delivering advanced, AI-driven solutions to government clients. The strategic location is intended to support growing demand for Workday AI-enabled services, including agentic AI for HR, finance, and procurement. \\n\\nThis move aligns with Workday’s cross-ecosystem agentic AI push, as it seeks to provide secure, scalable, and extensible platforms that appeal to federal and state agencies—key client segments for Deloitte’s own public sector and government practice. By deepening regional support and enabling local workforce expertise, Workday paves the way for accelerated deployments and more context-aware agentic solutions, raising the bar for client expectations on service, compliance, and industry specificity.\\n\\nFor Deloitte, this signals rising client interest and procurement activity in the government sector, underlining the value of an advisory approach that blends technical implementation with policy, governance, and change management expertise for AI-driven transformation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-10-Workday-Announces-New-Reston,-Virginia-Office-to-Serve-as-Regional-Hub-for-Growing-Public-Sector-Business\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI Integration and Data Governance Dominate Enterprise Conversations (Nov. 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Recent Bain and IDC insights echo growing enterprise demand for agentic AI layered atop trustworthy data infrastructure. Across industries, the emphasis is on integrating AI agents within existing SaaS systems, ensuring data readiness, and applying best-in-class governance models to reduce risk. Workday’s continued release of Illuminate™ and Data Cloud features provides customers with actionable paths to both leverage AI agents and demonstrate regulatory and ethical compliance.\\n\\nFor Deloitte, this reinforces the need for solution architectures and implementation plans that incorporate robust data strategies and explainable agentic models. Clients are seeking clear roadmaps for modernization, balancing rapid adoption with the fiduciary duty to eliminate algorithmic bias and adhere to emerging NIST AI risk frameworks. Deloitte’s consulting offerings will be judged on their ability to merge innovation and compliance—helping clients unlock value while maintaining trust.\\n\\nWith trustworthy AI emerging as a compliance necessity, Deloitte’s dual roles as system integrator and governance advisor become more tightly intertwined, enhancing differentiation in the market.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/ai\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;UKG, Dayforce, and SAP Intensify Agentic AI Competition with Industry-Built Agents (Nov. 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;UKG’s unveiling of Bryte AI agents and Dayforce’s ongoing rollout of branded AI agents highlight an industry-wide move toward practical, agentic workflows embedded directly within HCM suites. UKG’s focus is on employee self-service and operational automations, while Dayforce is leveraging agents for streamlined HR, benefits, and payroll. SAP continues to tout Joule agents and their extensibility across workflows and industry applications.\\n\\nThese advances underscore a market pivot: agentic AI is not just a visionary concept, but an operational differentiator. Workday’s ecosystem must deliver seamless, extensible agent deployment and management, with open APIs and robust partner support, to maintain parity and market relevance—especially as SAP and Dayforce push deeper into verticalized, process-driven use cases.\\n\\nFor Deloitte, this trajectory points to rising client demands for outcome-driven demos, proof-of-value agent deployments, and rapid co-innovation spanning the SaaS vendor, Deloitte, and client teams. Advisory and implementation teams must sharpen their expertise on competitive agent functionality to design compelling, industry-specific transformation stories.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;EY and Deloitte Whitepapers Spotlight Risk, Trust, and Human-Centric Designs for Agentic AI (Nov. 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Both EY and Deloitte have published timely thought leadership on harnessing agentic AI for effective risk management and delivering trustworthy, responsible AI services. EY articulates the importance of risk-augmented agentic systems and prescribes practical governance and risk controls that can be embedded across SaaS applications. Deloitte details the operationalization of AI ethics frameworks, focusing on transparency, bias mitigation, and ongoing monitoring as foundational to trusted enterprise AI.\\n\\nThese positions reinforce that agentic AI rollouts must be as much about method and design—embedding risk, auditability, and adaptability—as about technical capability. For SaaS buyers and regulators, responsible AI is no longer theoretical; it’s rapidly becoming a procurement and brand differentiator.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this opens up new service opportunities, from implementing agentic AI controls to advising on evolving regulatory landscapes and guiding C-suite leaders through change management in the age of intelligent automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_qa/insights/financial-services/emeia/what-risk-leaders-need-to-do-now-about-agentic-ai\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched Bryte AI agents, automating workforce and HR processes inside UKG Pro HCM suite.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;UKG signals a directly competitive response to Workday’s agentic strategy, emphasizing production-ready workflow automations, self-service, and extensibility within HCM.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In short, orchestration is the backbone that turns AI Agents from clever prototypes into enterprise-ready solutions.\n\n# Behind the Scenes [...] Complexity of Enterprise Workflows  \n  Modern business processes involve multiple applications, data sources, and decision points. AI Agents need a way to coordinate these steps seamlessly.\n Governance and Compliance  \n  Enterprises require control over how AI interacts with sensitive data and systems. Orchestration frameworks provide guardrails for security and compliance.\n Scalability and Maintainability [...] Enterprise-scale orchestration is achieved through graph-based workflows, human-in-the-loop approvals, and observability features. The Microsoft Agent Framework lays the foundation for multi-agent systems that are durable and compliant.\n\nBuilding AI Agents using Microsoft Agent Framework&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI: Orchestrates a network of specialized agents that collaborate across strategy, creation, compliance and execution. In RTIM, agentic AI not only orchestrates execution and interprets signals; it also manages workflows, enforces brand and regulatory standards, and coordinates human-in-the-loop oversight. [...] Agentic AI accomplishes this through networks of specialized agents, each designed for a distinct function. Each agent hands off its outputs to the next, creating a seamless, governed workflow from strategy to execution.\n\nGovernance is built in, with brand compliance agents and human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints ensuring accountability  . This modular approach delivers agility, scalability and resilience in fast-paced marketing environments. [...] #### The agentic AI path to success\n\nTo achieve both speed and safety, organizations must adopt a disciplined, hybrid approach. They can do this by:\n\n Defining clear boundaries: Use agentic AI for ideation and operational agility.\n Maintaining governance: Keep core decision logic under traditional AI and HITL oversight.\n Applying explainability: Reserve high-stakes decisions for interpretable models and human experts.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Agentic AI has distinct advantages over traditional AI/ML automation\n\nAgentic AI differs from traditional automation in one critical way: it doesn’t just do. It plans, reasons, decides, orchestrates and executes. It understands intent, interprets context and acts independently to achieve defined goals.\n\nIn the AMS landscape, agentic AI translates into cost savings and operational improvements: [...] According to Gartner, enterprises use 70% of IT budgets on maintaining existing systems, which leaves little room for innovation. For CIOs, this isn’t just an operational burden; it’s a strategic bottleneck.\n\nAgentic AI presents an opportunity to invert this equation. By embedding reasoning, autonomy and self-learning into AMS AI agents, CIOs can shift from maintaining Microsoft Enterprise Apps and environments to continuously modernizing them. [...] Analyst studies show that the prize is large; enterprises routinely use most of their IT budgets on keeping current systems running. Combining observability with AI-driven automation materially reduces downtime and mean-time-to-repair.\n\nHere is a delivery-oriented, step-by-step playbook that turns agentic AI from a concept into a measurable operational advantage across Microsoft environments.\n\n### 1.

These systems can understand context, learning from data, and performing tasks without constant human intervention. The goal of agentic AI is to enhance efficiency, productivity, and decision-making by leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. [...] Bigger is not always better. Enterprises often assume they must scale a single model, but multi-agent systems show that orchestration of many smaller models with specialized agents are often more capable at solving complex problems, while being more adaptable, resilient, and cost-effective.\n\n Myth 5: Agents are purely technical and irrelevant for business strategy [...] Read blog\n\n# Demystifying Multi-Agent AI System\n\nNovember 14, 2025\n\n#### Demystifying Multi-Agent AI System\n\nA practical guide to understanding and applying agentic AI in the enterprise\n\nGet started on GitHub&quot;,

They move beyond providing insights and actively engage in the marketing process to achieve specific goals, such as: [...] | Agentic AI | Reasons through a situation, makes decisions, and takes action. | Building an audience segment, activating a campaign journey, or responding to a customer inquiry. | [...] Interacting with customers through advanced conversational interfaces\n Delivering hyper-personalized content and product recommendations\n Managing and optimizing campaign performance in real-time\n Automating multi-step internal and cross-departmental workflows\n\n## Agentic AI vs. generative and predictive AI in marketing\n\nAgentic AI builds upon existing AI technology, but its function is distinct:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Riding the AI Wave: How Microsoft Entra is Evolving for ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Think about how SCIM works today: We use it to put a user from your HR system into Entra, which creates a user record in Entra, then we send it out to other apps through your governance system.\n\nWe need the same thing for agents. Any kind of agent builder (something that creates agents) needs the ability to use SCIM to put agent records into Entra. Then Entra can retrieve those agent records and configure them correctly into all of your SaaS apps. [...] IDC projects that by 2028, there’ll be 1.3 billion AI agents in large companies in the developed world.2 As just one real world example of this coming wave, at Microsoft, we’re already using agents in development, security, research, and analytics. From what I see, it won’t take long before we have more agents than human employees. My bet? Within two years, we&#x27;ll have over a million active AI agents in the Microsoft tenant. [...] 1. Domain knowledge: It knows about your business, a specific process, or technology areas, ideally with memory so it can learn and improve.\n2. Ability to act: It can make API calls to something like MS Graph, Azure resources, or other systems to take action, and then send input or data back to whoever called it.\n\nAnd since they can act, agents need proper access controls. My assertion is that every single agent needs an identity.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Before we had the Employee Self-Service Agent, the employee-assistance experience was kind of fragmented across mobile, websites, and physical kiosks,” says Becky West, principal group product manager in Microsoft Digital. The Employee Self-Service Agent was built with Microsoft Copilot Studio, a tool that enables users to create and extend AI agents. “One benefit of this is that anything you can do with Copilot Studio in terms of a custom engine agent, you can do in the Employee Self-Service Agent,” says Kyle von Haden, a principal group product manager for the Microsoft 365 Copilot product group. “For the Employee Self-Service Agent, the role of our internal users as Customer Zero has been incredibly important—in this case, doubly so,” says Kirk Gregersen, corporate vice president of product for Microsoft Viva and Microsoft 365 Copilot Experiences.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The company said it’s also expanding the Developer Copilot, its conversational AI codeveloper that allows developers to work faster, with Workday Extend, a low-code no-code tool that allows users to quickly take ideas from alpha mode to deployment. [...] Grippo said using Extend has been a powerful tool for nontechnical workers to bring ideas to life that otherwise they would not be able to create. By combining it with Copilot, it will combine the best of both worlds, helping bridge the gap between the highly technical and those with less coding experience who are just throwing together more simple applications. [...] Announced during the company’s annual developer conference Workday DevCon 2025 in Las Vegas, the new toolset includes an Agent Gateway that will provide connectors for third-party AI agents and for agent-to-agent collaboration, AI widgets and expanded application programming interfaces for native integration into AI apps.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Demystifying Multi-Agent AI System&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act autonomously and make decisions on behalf of users or organizations. These systems can understand context, learning from data, and performing tasks without constant human intervention. The goal of agentic AI is to enhance efficiency, productivity, and decision-making by leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. [...] Companies see the greatest impact when they redesign entire workflows around agents — not just plug agents into old processes. Agents shouldn’t be applied everywhere. For predictable, rules-based tasks, traditional automation still works better. Agentic AI shines when processes involve ambiguity, long-tail variation, or multi-step decision paths.\n\n### Common Myths and Misconceptions [...] Multi-agent AI systems represent the next phase in the evolution towards autonomy — where intelligent systems don’t just generate content, but collaborate, reason, and act. As businesses rethink how work gets done and start using agents carefully and transparently, they’ll turn big ideas into real results. Agentic AI isn’t some future concept — it’s already becoming a core part of how smart organizations operate today.\n\n \n\n##### Praveen Tanguturi&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A lot of great agents that can help your business are already available in Microsoft 365 and the Security Copilot platform, as well as through our partners like Workday and ServiceNow [...] At Microsoft BUILD, we announced support for AI agents into Microsoft Entra. Our goal is simple: bring the same protections and controls you rely on for workforce identities to AI agents. We&#x27;ve added agents as an identity type in Microsoft Entra, and are developing capabilities for access management, security, and identity governance capabilities.  These agent identities will be pre-configured in the tools that you use to create agents, including Foundry, Copilot Studio, Security Copilot, at [...] First, get started experimenting with AI agents. See what works for you. Try our agents in Microsoft Entra, or build your own with Copilot Studio—you can do amazing things. I’ve noticed that what used to take my product management team three to four weeks to get done now takes two or three days with agents. Make sure your company has a plan to start piloting a few.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For instance, many of our customers rely on third-party solution providers such as Workday, SAP, or ServiceNow. So, our development process included producing connectors for some of these third-party offerings, making it easier for customers to integrate the Employee Self-Service Agent into their existing workflows.\n\nThis extensibility is an advantage of adopting the Employee Self-Service Agent, according to von Haden. [...] The workflow is simple—launch Microsoft 365 Copilot, select “Employee Self-Service,” and type in your query. The agent then orchestrates an authoritative response and/or offers a form that can be used to carry out the desired action (auto-populating the form with details from the chat where possible). [...] &gt; “This product is very significant for us, both from the user perspective and the cost-savings angle. We can get the right answers to and solve issues for our employees faster, which increases their satisfaction and helps them be more effective.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Kirk Gregersen, corporate vice president, Microsoft Viva and Microsoft 365 Copilot Experiences&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI and automation are at the core of this emerging new approach to service delivery. But instead of simply layering new technologies on top of old processes, many companies are rethinking and redesigning critical workflows—from front-line interactions to back-end execution. [...] One of the biggest arenas for all this change is service delivery, where AI and automation are upending long-standing assumptions about how work gets done. Entrenched models focused on optimizing labor costs and absorbing transactional tasks are being replaced by ones built around technology-enabled services and business outcomes. [...] That shift is increasingly being supported by a new class of modern managed services providers. These firms are helping organizations operationalize AI and automation across complex environments—integrating tools, updating workflows, and managing execution to help deliver measurable, scalable outcomes.\n\n95%\n\nof enterprises plan to increase AI spending.\n\n83%\n\nsay they are accelerating automation initiatives\n\n72%\n\nplan an automation implementation within two years.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining work. Now, leaders must redefine how they lead&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Responsible AI requires collaboration between HR, IT and compliance teams to establish clear ethical boundaries around AI use in hiring, promotion and performance evaluation. This requires communicating transparently about AI’s role in decision-making, monitoring bias and ensuring data privacy. [...] Approach AI integration as a talent transformation initiative, not just a tech initiative. And first, audit your roles to understand which tasks can be automated, which require human judgment and where new hybrid roles will emerge. From there, redefine performance metrics to capture both efficiency and creativity to get a full picture of the human and tech collaboration. [...] Companies like Klarna and IBM have already learned this lesson the hard way. Rapid automation led to mass layoffs and quality declines, followed by rehiring to restore human judgment and service excellence. The takeaway for employers? AI deployment must be strategic and realistic. Use automation to augment, not eliminate human capability.\n\nHere’s how leaders can get started.\n\n## Build an AI-ready workforce strategy&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;They’re picking a strategic metric that will boost their top line and reduce friction internally—such as revenue per employee—and running at it. They’re treating AI as a fully embedded part of their operating model, not simply a tool. They’re remembering the goals:\n\n Stop using employees’ time for lower-order, repeatable tasks.\n Build capacity and operational efficiency.\n Put AI to work for people. [...] That said, business transformation isn’t only top-down work. The bottom-up work is building and embracing an AI culture for career growth. Talent will always play a critical role—defining responsibilities, training the systems, reviewing outputs, and stepping in when performance changes. Talent that isn’t open to AI or skilled in the tools may get left behind. [...] # Getting real results from AI: Managing an agentic workforce\n\nAI has the potential to unlock more than $4 trillion in global productivity gains, according to McKinsey. It can make us more efficient, help us scale faster, and ensure our talent has ample career growth pathways.&quot;,

He declared that EEOC \&quot;must be a leader in this area\&quot; and encouraged attendees to reach out if they thought the agency \&quot;should provide guidance on specific issues relating to bias in technology.\&quot; [...] More recently, EEOC Commissioner Keith Sonderling warned employers attending an April 2021 American Bar Association conference that hiring tech tools create discrimination risks. He urged attendees to evaluate algorithms \&quot;early and often for biased outcomes and reengineer as appropriate.\&quot; [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nEEOC&#x27;s commitment is only the most recent action in a series of steps the agency has taken to enforce anti-discrimination laws in the evolving arena of employment technology.\n\nThe agency began its foray against tech-borne bias no later than 2016, when it held a public meeting to examine the implications of big data on the workplace.&quot;,

[...] “Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making tools have great potential to improve our lives, including in the area of employment,” Burrows said. “At the same time, the EEOC is keenly aware that these tools may mask and perpetuate bias or create new discriminatory barriers to jobs. We must work to ensure that these new technologies do not become a high-tech pathway to discrimination.”&quot;,

[...] April 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has told a federal judge that human resources software firm Workday must face a proposed class action alleging that it violated federal anti-bias laws by using artificial intelligence-powered software to screen out job applicants for other employers for discriminatory reasons. [...] Government agencies and worker advocates have expressed concerns that AI tools can discriminate against job applicants when they are built using data that reflects existing biases.\n\nThe EEOC has warned employers that they can be held legally liable if they fail to prevent screening software from having a discriminatory impact.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In an HR context, biased AI algorithms used for resume screening may favor candidates from certain demographic backgrounds, leading to a lack of diversity in hiring practices.\n In the finance sector, AI systems used for credit scoring may inadvertently disadvantage individuals from minority groups due to historical data reflecting systemic inequalities, resulting in fewer loan approvals for these applicants. [...] 2. Algorithmic bias: Algorithmic bias arises from the design and implementation of algorithms themselves. Even with unbiased data, the way algorithms process information can introduce bias. For instance, if an algorithm is optimized for efficiency without considering fairness, it may prioritize certain outcomes over others, resulting in discriminatory practices. [...] Bias in AI systems refers to systematic and unfair discrimination that arises from the design, development and deployment of AI technologies. It can manifest in various forms, including algorithmic bias, data bias and human bias, leading to outcomes that disproportionately affect certain groups of people based on characteristics such as race, gender, age or socioeconomic status.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Well, software as a service is constructed under the premise that I can solve 70 to 80% of a given business process either in an industry or across industries. And I can sell that product pretty widely into business, right? It&#x27;s like HR processes, if I get them 70 to 80% correct, I can cut across every industry workday, right? So or CRM processes, whether it&#x27;s Salesforce or Microsoft, if I get them 70 to 80% correct, I can sell that that product across all industries. AI is going to show up [...] ##### Venky Ananth:\n\nAbsolutely. It brings me to the question, and we&#x27;ve discussed this in the past, you always have this view that AI is a long game, you know, So what does it look like? How long is this long game going to play out? And what do you mean by, you know, it&#x27;s a long game? \n   Image 32: Paul Hlivko 3:46\n\n##### Paul Hlivko: [...] ##### Venky Ananth:\n\nThat&#x27;s such a fresh take on AI and very different talk track than what you normally find about everybody breathlessly talking about how AI is going to change everything for us. So while it&#x27;s going to change everything, like you said, I think you kind of tempered with, tempered it with a lot of practical wisdom and knowledge. So I appreciate that. Thank you so much. I totally enjoyed this conversation, Paul. \n   Image 68: Paul Hlivko 31:01\n\n##### Paul Hlivko:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Let’s look at some of the biggest risks you can face in process and automation transformation, and what you can do to prevent them from damaging your business value. In an ideal transformation, you’ll have already worked out a bold and effective strategy that includes scalable automation solutions and standardized processes. Creating a single center of excellence to orchestrate process automation strategy for your entire organization—like many PwC clients—is a great way to standardize requirements across teams and helps confirm everyone is staying controls-compliant. One of the easiest ways to help prevent and mitigate process and automation risks in your transformations is to involve your auditor. These can provide early insight into risks that are likely to erode value as you deploy and scale your automated processes.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Before you assume the picture is bleak, however, know that there are also strong signs of optimism and engagement. Most employees say they’re ready to adapt to new ways of working. Many are eager to upskill, and they see potential in using generative AI (GenAI) to increase their efficiency. More than half agree that recent changes they’ve experienced make them feel optimistic about their company’s future. [...] Despite their recognition of potential risks, employees’ perception of GenAI is notably more positive than negative (see chart below). More than 70% of employees in our survey who have used GenAI agree that the tools will create opportunities to learn new skills at work, be more creative at work and improve the quality of their work. And half of all adopters expect GenAI to lead to higher salaries—an expectation that’s even higher among those who use GenAI daily. [...] ### To what extent do you agree with the following statement about the impact of generative AI within your organisation or team?\n\n#### 1. It will lead to bias against specific people or groups.\n\n#### 2. It will increase the spread of misinformation that will seem credible to employees.\n\n#### 3. It will create opportunities for employees to develop new skills.\n\n#### 4. It will improve the quality of employees’ work.\n\n5 of 5&quot;,

Because it redefines how HR operates, from automating routine tasks to becoming a strategic, analytics-driven core: that potential is real. But it actually goes well beyond quantifiable benefits and the HR team’s own efficiency gains. [...] This evolution has led to a major shift in organisations’ main value cases for technology investments. Our 2025 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends survey found that the top two business case drivers for investing in new technologies were enabling a workforce to do more, faster and to decrease cost.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leaders in the energy sector are navigating a transformation of scale and complexity. This presents an opportunity to reimagine the future of energy enabled by the responsible and strategic application of AI.\n\n- Jennifer Steinmann, Deloitte Global Sustainability Business leader\n\n### Get in touch\n\n#### Jennifer Steinmann\n\nDeloitte Global Sustainability Business Leader\n\njsteinmann@deloitte.com\n\n+1 415-783-5247\n\n#### Costi Perricos\n\nGlobal GenAI Business Leader\n\ncperricos@deloitte.co.uk [...] AI offers a key solution to help transform energy systems—while saving substantially more energy than it consumes. By optimizing operations and enhancing system reliability, AI can help drive energy efficiency, cost savings, and emission reductions.\n\nBy 2050, AI could save almost 12,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy and unlock nearly US$500 billion in cost reductions, while avoiding substantial emissions annually.\n\n### Potential benefits by 2030\n\nUp to 3,700  \n TWh [...] Energy and industrial manufacturing companies are the main drivers of AI deployment as the end-users and owners of operational data. Prioritizing high-quality data, cybersecurity and governance can help with implementation, while investing in scalable applications like AI-driven asset optimization, predictive maintenance and real-time system balancing can help generate rapid returns and resilience.\n\n##### Technology companies&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Despite their recognition of potential risks, employees’ perception of GenAI is notably more positive than negative (see chart below). More than 70% of employees in our survey who have used GenAI agree that the tools will create opportunities to learn new skills at work, be more creative at work and improve the quality of their work. And half of all adopters expect GenAI to lead to higher salaries—an expectation that’s even higher among those who use GenAI daily. [...] ### 3.    Help employees lead on innovation\n\nWorkers and CEOs are on the same page when it comes to red tape, wasted time and organisational friction at work. Both feel about 40% of the time they spend on administrative activities is being spent inefficiently—and both believe GenAI could help free up that time. More than 80% of workers who use GenAI daily expect it to make their time at work more efficient in the next 12 months (see chart below). [...] Employees recognise that GenAI, like any other technology, has both strengths and weaknesses. Among their concerns are that GenAI will increase bias against them at work, and that GenAI may produce misinformation that they won’t be able to recognise. These perceptions are more widespread among GenAI’s most frequent users. This speaks to the importance of having a supportive environment with clear governance, guidelines and training. That also includes having guard rails and a Responsible AI&quot;,

Both feel about 40% of the time they spend on administrative activities is being spent inefficiently—and both believe GenAI could help free up that time. More than 80% of workers who use GenAI daily expect it to make their time at work more efficient in the next 12 months (see chart below). [...] In addition, senior leaders can lead by example. Only about one in five senior executives and 17% of managers say they’re using GenAI daily—a clear call to action for leaders to upskill and use GenAI as much as employees do, not just for their own work, but so that they can coach workers on ways to use it in theirs.\n\n### 4.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### 3.    Help employees lead on innovation\n\nWorkers and CEOs are on the same page when it comes to red tape, wasted time and organisational friction at work. Both feel about 40% of the time they spend on administrative activities is being spent inefficiently—and both believe GenAI could help free up that time. More than 80% of workers who use GenAI daily expect it to make their time at work more efficient in the next 12 months (see chart below). [...] Despite their recognition of potential risks, employees’ perception of GenAI is notably more positive than negative (see chart below). More than 70% of employees in our survey who have used GenAI agree that the tools will create opportunities to learn new skills at work, be more creative at work and improve the quality of their work. And half of all adopters expect GenAI to lead to higher salaries—an expectation that’s even higher among those who use GenAI daily. [...] In addition, senior leaders can lead by example. Only about one in five senior executives and 17% of managers say they’re using GenAI daily—a clear call to action for leaders to upskill and use GenAI as much as employees do, not just for their own work, but so that they can coach workers on ways to use it in theirs.\n\n### 4.

So, our development process included producing connectors for some of these third-party offerings, making it easier for customers to integrate the Employee Self-Service Agent into their existing workflows.\n\nThis extensibility is an advantage of adopting the Employee Self-Service Agent, according to von Haden. [...] &gt; “At Microsoft, our mission is to transform the employee experience with AI solutions that provide personalized and seamless interactions for our employees throughout the workday. What we’ve created with the Employee Self-Service Agent is a powerful example of a solution doing just that.”\n&gt;\n&gt; Nathalie D’Hers, corporate vice president, Employee Experience [...] In developing the Employee Self-Service Agent, we initially identified two main categories of employee assistance to focus on: HR and technical support. These are areas that generate millions of internal queries and support cases (help tickets) from our employees every year, which means the potential for a significant return on investment (ROI). (We subsequently added real estate and facilities later in the process.)&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Which is why leaders at a 21st-century multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate recently found themselves pondering the state of some of their technology. They were concerned, specifically, about their identity governance and administration (IGA) system—the back-office stuff that makes sure the right people have the right access to the right things (like payroll, HR, IT, and other resources). [...] From a user perspective, the company today enjoys a single, scalable, modern IGA system that works the same for every employee regardless of position or country in which they work, with standardized processes, governance, and controls on the back end to match. Gone are manual updates, replaced by automated transactions for things like changes in HR information or application access, with up to 4 million of these transactions logged per month. New employees—more than 40,000 of them added through [...] In other words, the company was experiencing its own version of gauge breaks: no consistent, standardized way to manage employee data from point A (when they were hired) to point B (when they left), or even for points in between. So it was wasting time and effort, increasing costs and compliance risk, and decreasing operational efficiency.&quot;,

The product is just going to get richer and richer over time as it extends into other lines of business.” [...] Those are also important categories included in the Employee Self-Service Agent, something the flexibility and extensibility of Copilot Studio makes possible.\n\n“Our employees rely on AI tools like Copilot to help get their work done,” West says. “And the same is now true for resolving an issue related to facilities, HR, or IT support.

Now we’re applying the capabilities of Copilot and agentic technology to the ongoing challenge of employee assistance. [...] With Copilot, you might ask for an overview of everything to do with a given project. But when it comes to employee-assistance topics, casting a wide net is not the desired outcome. An employee doesn’t want to hear about HR policies in India when they work in the U.S., or to get Mac-focused tech help when they use a PC. The needs of each of our employees are different, and so we built the agent to reflect that.&quot;,
