<li><b>Workday Research Finds Companies Leaving AI Gains on the Table (Published 2026-01-14)</b><br><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-14-New-Workday-Research-Companies-Are-Leaving-AI-Gains-on-the-Table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a> & <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601140530PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA62950-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Market data</a><br>
A sweeping Workday study finds that many enterprises adopting AI platforms are not yet capturing its full value, with integration and orchestration—not adoption itself—emerging as barriers. Demonstrated AI ROI now depends on creating agentic, outcome-centric workflows. This insight requires consultancies like Deloitte to synchronize their market offerings around value frameworks, practical agent deployment, and relevant data analytics accelerators (e.g. Prism Analytics). Workday’s positioning as an orchestrator for agentic AI can serve as a core differentiator when combined with consulting-led transformation.</li>
<li><b>SAP Outlines Secure Multi-Layer Architecture for Business AI (Published 2026-01-15)</b><br><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-a-multi-layer-architecture-for-enterprise-trust/ba-p/14305070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br>
SAP has publicly detailed a multi-layer architecture for AI security and compliance. By extending security beyond technical controls to continuous risk monitoring and explainability, SAP sets an industry benchmark that directly shapes client and regulatory conversations. Workday’s own secure AI narratives (<a href="https://forms.workday.com/en-us/webinars/how-workday-secures-and-protects-sensitive-data-in-generative-ai/form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see Workday</a>) must be regularly refreshed to match evolving expectations. Deloitte must be equipped to operationalize these cross-vendor frameworks for clients in sectors with elevated risk and compliance needs.</li>
<li><b>AI ROI Race Shifts to Agentic Models, Says Dell (Published 2025-12-11)</b><br><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/11/ai-roi-race-now-agent-defined-dell-claims-aifactoriesdatacenters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br>
Dell identifies the next phase of enterprise AI ROI as being agent-defined. SaaS companies are pressured to move from simple analytics to full agentic automation in workflows. Deloitte’s Workday team can respond by prioritizing agentic transformation in client roadmaps, including rapid prototyping and robust governance—from initial pilot to scaled deployment.</li>

Forrester benchmarks conversational AI leaders, underscoring the importance of native agentic extensibility and compliance features. Platform selection will increasingly depend on the strength of an ecosystem’s agentic integration and governance story—Workday and consulting partners must help clients build winning business cases by focusing on these criteria.</li>
<li><b>EEOC and HR Dive Reinforce AI Compliance Risks for HR Platforms (Updated 2026-01-14)</b><br><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-challenges-hitting-HR-EEOC/644485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI and HR challenges</a>; <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-hints-at-2026-priorities-with-national-origin-bias-guidance/806115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National origin bias</a>; <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-settlement-job-site-use-ai-bias/645612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI bias settlements</a><br>

</ul>
<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<ul>
<li>The SaaS ecosystem’s agentic AI discussion matured sharply, as multiple vendors and GSIs—led by Workday, SAP, Dell, and Deloitte—moved from generic AI enablement to agent-led business transformation and secure, governable workflows.</li>
<li>Research and regulatory coverage (Workday, EEOC, and HR Dive) heightened the importance of risk, explainability, and organizational readiness for agentic HR and finance solutions.</li>
<li>Platform extensibility and integration, as highlighted by Forrester, became key differentiators, pressuring both vendors and system integrators to accelerate agentic feature rollouts and deep-dive client enablement.</li>
</ul>

Major SaaS players and GSIs are racing to define architectures for agent-driven value capture, with immediate implications for consulting enablement and client storytelling.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Research Finds Companies Leaving AI Gains on the Table (Published 2026-01-14)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new Workday research report (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-14-New-Workday-Research-Companies-Are-Leaving-AI-Gains-on-the-Table\\\&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601140530PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA62950-1\\\&quot;&gt;market data&lt;/a&gt;) revealed that organizations are adopting AI but struggling to translate these investments into realized business value, with only a minority reporting significant productivity or financial gains. The study, spanning multiple regions and industries, highlights common barriers such as legacy integration, change management, and the lack of agentic AI orchestration. This insight has strong implications for SaaS partners and consultancies like Deloitte: clients are eager for hands-on solutions that drive value beyond mere AI adoption, pushing integrators to focus on agentic workflows, robust analytics, and measurable business outcomes. The research signals a shift in enterprise sentiment—away from experimentation to demonstrable ROI—and positions Workday’s differentiators in analytics and agentic workflow orchestration as critical levers for consulting-led transformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this means placing greater emphasis on value capture frameworks and showcasing proprietary approaches to agent enablement within existing HCM and ERP environments. The integration of Prism Analytics, for example, becomes a strategic asset when clients are challenged to demonstrate tangible AI impact.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-14-New-Workday-Research-Companies-Are-Leaving-AI-Gains-on-the-Table\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Outlines Secure Multi-Layer Architecture for Business AI (Published 2026-01-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP detailed its comprehensive multi-layer approach to securing SAP Business AI (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-a-multi-layer-architecture-for-enterprise-trust/ba-p/14305070\\\&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). This architecture spans data governance, access control, algorithmic transparency, and compliance safeguards, exemplifying how leading vendors are preempting regulatory and enterprise trust challenges as AI agents move deeper into core business processes. SAP&#x27;s emphasis on continuous risk monitoring and explainability aligns with Workday’s own messaging around security in generative AI (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://forms.workday.com/en-us/webinars/how-workday-secures-and-protects-sensitive-data-in-generative-ai/form.html\\\&quot;&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt;), highlighting a growing consensus on the non-negotiables for enterprise trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Deloitte, the ability to directly compare and tailor security frameworks across SaaS platforms—including Workday, SAP, and Oracle—is now a client expectation. Deloitte teams must not only track evolving best practices but actively guide clients through their practical implementation, increasingly leveraging point-of-view (POV) materials and cross-vendor toolkits in HR and finance transformation engagements.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-a-multi-layer-architecture-for-enterprise-trust/ba-p/14305070\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI ROI Race Shifts to Agentic Models, Says Dell (Published 2025-12-11)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Dell, with broad implications for SaaS ecosystems, posited in reporting (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/11/ai-roi-race-now-agent-defined-dell-claims-aifactoriesdatacenters\\\&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) that the next AI ROI wave will be &#x27;agent-defined.&#x27; This signals a market-wide pivot toward deploying AI agents—autonomous or semi-autonomous digital workers—that go beyond predictive analytics to execute and orchestrate tasks in real time. For SaaS vendors, including Workday, the emphasis is shifting quickly from &#x27;adding AI&#x27; to &#x27;redesigning workflows around AI agents.&#x27;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Deloitte’s engagements, this means that client value propositions need to be reframed from &#x27;efficiency via analytics&#x27; to &#x27;transformation via agents,&#x27; with stress on governance, change management, and the skills needed to operationalize these AI capabilities end-to-end. The urgency in executive sentiment urges practitioners to accelerate client roadmaps toward agentic architectures using consultative accelerators and proof-of-value pilots.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/11/ai-roi-race-now-agent-defined-dell-claims-aifactoriesdatacenters\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Capabilities Go Mainstream in Global SI Offerings (Published 2026-01-12)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte’s &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/what-we-do/capabilities/agentic-ai.html\\\&quot;&gt;Agentic AI&lt;/a&gt; portfolio now centers on the orchestration of autonomous agents, with integrated governance mechanisms and accelerators that bridge traditional workflow automation and the new agentic paradigm. Other GSIs—highlighted in TCS’s ongoing agent-led transformations (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/news-alert/tcs-partners-workday-unlock-power-human-capital-supercharge-workplaces-ai\\\&quot;&gt;TCS-Workday partnership&lt;/a&gt;)—are converging toward similar approaches, blending AI modernization with secure, explainable deployment at scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trend is reshaping client conversations: large enterprises—Workday&#x27;s core base—now expect blueprints for agentic workflow enablement and quantified roadmaps for talent upskilling. Deloitte’s Workday teams should prioritize pilot-driven narratives that showcase business-case clarity, client co-innovation, and stepwise enablement to move from static RPA to dynamic agentic orchestration.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/what-we-do/capabilities/agentic-ai.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;New Forrester Wave on Conversational AI Platforms for Employee Services (Published 2026-01-11)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Forrester’s latest report (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.forrester.com/report/the-forrester-wave-tm-conversational-ai-platforms-for-employee-services-q3-2024/RES181076?ref_search=0_1739670599889\\\&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) benchmarks major conversational AI offerings aimed at employee services across SaaS HCM/ERP players. The results underline rapid advances in natural language processing, agent orchestration, and seamless integration with enterprise data lakes. Vendors are now scored on extensibility, governance, and success in embedding agentic functionality as a core product pillar rather than bolt-on innovation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This competitive landscape challenges Workday (and its consulting partners) to demonstrate continuous investment in native AI capabilities and practical extensibility, particularly in industries facing compliance or security concerns. For Deloitte, the report’s findings equip teams to anticipate client skepticism and proactively address &#x27;feature gap&#x27; narratives with integrated demo stories, PoC roadmaps, and clear differentiation in compliance and explainability.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.forrester.com/report/the-forrester-wave-tm-conversational-ai-platforms-for-employee-services-q3-2024/RES181076?ref_search=0_1739670599889\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;EEOC and HR Dive Reinforce AI Compliance Risks for HR Platforms (Updated 2026-01-14)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Multiple articles from HR Dive (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-challenges-hitting-HR-EEOC/644485\\\&quot;&gt;AI and HR challenges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-hints-at-2026-priorities-with-national-origin-bias-guidance/806115\\\&quot;&gt;national origin bias&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/eeoc-settlement-job-site-use-ai-bias/645612\\\&quot;&gt;AI bias settlements&lt;/a&gt;) show intensifying regulatory scrutiny on bias and discrimination in HR platforms. EEOC’s updated guidance and high-profile settlements amplify enterprise concerns about bias in recruiting, compensation, and internal mobility algorithms, with enforcement actions targeting both SaaS vendors and their clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This places immediate responsibility on consulting partners such as Deloitte to not only assess AI model risk and compliance alignment for Workday projects, but also to actively help clients build monitoring, documentation, and intervention frameworks for AI-driven HR processes. Proactive compliance is increasingly a core value prop, and Deloitte’s ability to translate regulatory complexity into actionable, auditable controls is a clear differentiation lever in the market.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-challenges-hitting-HR-EEOC/644485\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Strengthens Agentic AI Narrative in Prism Analytics and Client Stories (Published 2026-01-10–2026-01-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday has amplified its messaging on agentic analytics with new content around Prism Analytics (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/workday-podcast-comcast-data-insights-workday-prism-analytics.html\\\&quot;&gt;Comcast podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases?l=25\\\&quot;&gt;press releases&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating how data unification and AI-driven workflows combine to produce smarter, action-oriented decisions in HR and finance. These deployments make a compelling case that a secure, extensible data layer is foundational for SaaS agent orchestration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Deloitte, this reinforces the opportunity to lead on agentic analytics, connecting real-world use cases with legacy data modernization and upskilling efforts. Framing engagements around data readiness and agent orchestrator deployment will drive faster maturity for clients and enhance Deloitte’s positioning as an end-to-end transformation partner.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/workday-podcast-comcast-data-insights-workday-prism-analytics.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP has articulated a multi-layer security and governance architecture as the backbone of its Business AI strategy, explicitly addressing risk monitoring, compliance, and explainability at the platform level.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This approach raises the bar for incumbent vendors and GSIs alike, requiring consultancies to articulate not only vendor-native security but also how to operationalize cross-platform controls and auditability.

Demonstrated AI ROI now depends on creating agentic, outcome-centric workflows. This insight requires consultancies like Deloitte to synchronize their market offerings around value frameworks, practical agent deployment, and relevant data analytics accelerators (e.g. Prism Analytics). Workday’s positioning as an orchestrator for agentic AI can serve as a core differentiator when combined with consulting-led transformation.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAP Outlines Secure Multi-Layer Architecture for Business AI (Published 2026-01-15)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-a-multi-layer-architecture-for-enterprise-trust/ba-p/14305070\\\&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\nSAP has publicly detailed a multi-layer architecture for AI security and compliance.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Securing SAP Business AI: A Multi-Layer Architectu...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This diagram illustrates broadly how SAP Business AI executes agentic workflows in a controlled, enterprise-grade manner. The flow begins with the user interacting through Joule in the experience layer. Joule captures intent and context but does not execute logic itself. Instead, it forwards the request to the agent orchestration layer running on SAP BTP, where the execution lifecycle is coordinated under policy control. [...] This layer is responsible for shaping requests before they ever reach a model. Prompts are templated to enforce consistency, sensitive data is masked where required, and content filters are applied to ensure responsible usage. Agent memory allows the system to maintain conversational and task context across multiple steps, enabling more advanced, agentic execution patterns. By centralizing orchestration here, SAP ensures that AI behavior is predictable, repeatable, and policy aware. [...] Running alongside all layers are cross-cutting enterprise controls covering identity and access, data protection, content safety, and observability. Authentication, principal propagation, OAuth-based access, encryption, tenant isolation, audit logging, and monitoring are not tied to a single layer but are enforced consistently across the entire stack.\n\nThis design reinforces a core principle of SAP Business AI: SAP Business AI is designed to extend existing enterprise security controls rather than introduce parallel security models. Identity, authorization, and audit principles that govern SAP applications are applied consistently to AI-driven interactions.\n\nAgentic AI Execution Flow: From User Intent to Governed Business Action&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The API Authorization Hierarchy of Needs&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;If Level 3 is about constraining a deterministic Slack bot, Level 4 is about constraining a probabilistic AI that might hallucinate or pursue a specific intent.\n\nThe industry is defining standards like MCP Authorization, creating AI/MCP Gateways, or implementing standards like Cross App Access to address these needs. However it’s still early and we have a lot to learn.\n\n## Without Authorization There Is No Agentic Future\n\nIt is still early days, and we don&#x27;t know which architectural patterns will prevail. But one thing is not up for discussion: Without properly handling authorization for users and clients in your API layer first, there is no Agentic AI future. [...] Unauthorized data: A user asks for a summary. The agent uses a vector database containing tickets from all projects and applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to craft the answer. This design guarantees that the user will inadvertently be shown data from projects they are not authorized to access.\n\nOrchestration Failure: A user says, \&quot;Email a summary to my manager.\&quot; Without strict boundaries, the agent might email the entire company or an external contact. This happens because the Agent inherits the user&#x27;s full permissions. If the user can email the company, the Agent can too. We need to restrict the Agent to the specific task, not the user&#x27;s total potential.\n\nAs an industry, we are exploring certain patterns to address some of these scenarios: [...] The vision is seductive. We want users to use their preferred LLM and write \&quot;Summarize my team&#x27;s work this week,\&quot; and have an AI autonomously fetch data, reason over it, and deliver the result. But before you can expose your application to AI agents, you have to face a hard truth: There are no shortcuts in authorization.\n\nTo enable your product to be used by LLMs and agents, you need to provide an external API for your product. If your API authorization layer isn&#x27;t mature enough to handle complex human hierarchies, it will crumble under the weight of autonomous agents. AI agents can become loose cannons, capable of hallucinating its way into administrative privileges, leaking data across tenant boundaries or even deleting your entire database.&quot;,

[...] Choose an algorithm family that best suits your task. Evaluate the different algorithms within the family to find the appropriate fit for your workload. For more information, see Machine learning algorithms.\n\n### Machine learning\n\nMachine learning is an AI technique that uses algorithms to create predictive models. These algorithms parse data fields and learn from the patterns within data to generate models. The models can then make informed predictions or decisions based on new data.\n\nThe predictive models are validated against known data, measured by performance metrics for specific business scenarios, and then adjusted as needed. This process of learning and validation is called training. Through periodic retraining, machine learning models improve over time.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As AI systems mature into multi‑agent ecosystems, the need for agents to communicate reliably and securely has become fundamental. Traditionally, agents built on different frameworks like Semantic Kernel, LangChain, custom orchestrators, or enterprise APIs do not share a common communication model. This creates brittle integrations, duplicate logic, and siloed intelligence. The Agent‑to‑Agent Standard (A2AS) addresses this gap by defining a universal, vendor‑neutral protocol for structured agent interoperability. A2A establishes a common language for agents, built on familiar web primitives: JSON‑RPC 2.0 for messaging and HTTPS for transport. Each agent exposes a machine‑readable Agent Card describing its capabilities, supported input/output modes, and authentication requirements. [...] input/output modes, and authentication requirements. Interactions are modeled as Tasks, which support synchronous, streaming, and long‑running workflows. Messages exchanged within a task contain Parts; text, structured data, files, or streams, that allow agents to collaborate without exposing internal implementation details. By standardizing discovery, communication, authentication, and task orchestration, A2A enables organizations to build composable AI architectures. Specialized agents can coordinate deep reasoning, planning, data retrieval, or business automation regardless of their underlying frameworks or hosting environments. This modularity, combined with industry adoption and Linux Foundation governance, positions A2A as a foundational protocol for interoperable AI systems.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;HR Tech ROI: Hidden and Obvious Value Drivers | UKG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;IBM used AI to manage employee HR inquiries, freeing staff to work on strategic transformation initiatives. Over two years, the company improved productivity by $3.5 billion.\n\n The YMCA of Metropolitan Dallas, which employs between 2,400 and 3,000 people, needed scalable hiring to meet seasonal demand. By using UKG Ready to automate hiring, onboarding, and training, they saved more than 600 hours annually and were able to raise their minimum wage.\n\n A Forrester study, The Total Economic Impact of UKG Pro Workforce Management, revealed a 169% return on investment over three years, totaling $34 million in workforce productivity and efficiency gains.\n\nThese results demonstrate that ROI from HR tech extends well beyond cost savings — it’s about driving long-term, strategic value. [...] Better Compliance: Built-in tools help organizations stay up to date with labor laws and industry regulations, avoiding penalties and reputational damage.\n\n Faster, Better Hiring: Streamlined recruiting tools reduce time-to-fill and improve candidate matching.\n\n Higher-Quality Hires: Employees who are onboarded effectively and matched well to roles tend to ramp up more quickly and are less likely to leave within the first 60–90 days.\n\nThese improvements enhance organizational agility and resilience, which are critical capabilities in today’s business environment.\n\n## Real-world examples: ROI in action\n\nOrganizations across industries are realizing significant returns on their HR tech investments: [...] These gains often translate into tangible improvements in productivity. For example, consider a company with 500 employees and an average revenue per employee of $100,000. A 4% productivity improvement—achieved through more efficient systems and processes—generates $2 million in value creation annually.\n\n## Beyond the basics: Risk reduction and outcome improvement\n\nHR technology also contributes ROI in less visible but equally powerful ways; particularly by reducing risk and improving outcomes across the employee lifecycle.\n\nSome of these include:\n\n Fewer Payroll Errors: Automation significantly reduces mistakes such as overpayments, which can erode trust and increase operational costs.&quot;,

[...] That’s what real enterprise impact looks like when AI agents act rather than just answering questions. When AI agents are deployed across HR and connected systems, busywork stops being a bottleneck. With autonomous HR, AI agents execute end-to-end work—involving humans when required—to complete tasks and enhance employee experiences.\n\nThe results:\n\n   HR and managers reclaim time for strategic talent work.\n   Manager and employee productivity improves.\n   Capacity returns to the business.\n\nAutonomous HR drives a shift from reactive HR service delivery to proactive, intelligent, autonomous orchestration of the employee lifecycle.\n\n### Innovations for everyday employee work&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI ROI race is now defined by agents, Dell claims - SiliconANGLE&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This potential is significant, but Dell emphasizes that governance and profitability must remain in lockstep. When autonomous agents leverage proprietary data, it invites the risks of unfocused experimentation and wasted resources. The companies achieving transformative AI ROI are those that narrow their scope, enforce strong governance and advance at least one high-impact use case into full production, while others remain stalled in the proof of concept phase, Roese explained. [...] Roese spoke with theCUBE’s John Furrier (left) for theCUBE + NYSE Wired: AI Factories – Data Centers of the Future interview series, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed autonomous agents and data hygiene emerging as the through-line between the AI factory’s promise and measurable enterprise returns.\n\n### Robust data and governed agents turn hype into AI ROI\n\nDell has spent the past year positioning itself as a key builder of AI factories for enterprises and governments. But beyond the headlines and inside the company’s own operations, AI is already changing how work gets done. The company has been running fully autonomous agents for more than a year and a half, granting them valuable insights, Roese noted. [...] Of course, that kind of disruption only pays off if it’s anchored in something defensible. That’s why Dell is betting that what’s driving AI ROI isn’t the model, but the data behind it. The companies that win are the ones that can wrap large language models around knowledge graphs that capture their deepest expertise and domain insight, Roese noted.\n\n“Michael [Dell] has said this for years — that data is the most important asset in your enterprise — and if you control the data, you will get value,” he said. “Up until now, it was generally direct value to human beings. In the AI cycle, especially with agents, if you control proprietary data that is unique to your company, that is the manifestation of your expertise [and] you now have a tool called autonomous agents that can scale that.”&quot;,

Organizational readiness is a crucial component of realizing ROI. \n\nKey factors that influence readiness include: \n\nTransparent Communication: Everyone affected should understand the “why” and “why now” behind the change. \n\nBy addressing these elements up front, organizations can smooth the path to adoption and accelerate the timeline for realizing returns. [...] ## The emerging role of AI in HR ROI\n\nLooking ahead, artificial intelligence is poised to become a transformative driver of HR technology ROI. It extends beyond automation and into areas that amplify strategic decision-making and agility. \n\nConsider these AI-driven use cases: \n\nThese applications help organizations not only respond faster to workforce needs but also stay ahead of emerging challenges—amplifying both short-term ROI and long-term strategic impact. \n\n## In summary: Technology as a strategic lever [...] ## In summary: Technology as a strategic lever\n\nThe ROI of HR technology isn’t limited to dollars saved, it’s about maximizing the full potential of your workforce. By reducing risk, accelerating hiring, improving employee experience, and enabling strategic agility, HR technology becomes a critical lever in achieving competitive advantage. \n\nAccording to a Forbes report, 92% of C-suite leaders believe organizational agility is essential to business success, yet only 27% consider themselves highly agile. Organizations that prioritize agility are more than twice as likely to achieve top-tier financial performance compared to their peers.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Banks enter agentic AI era as tech race heats up, ROI in focus&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Banks enter agentic AI era as tech race heats up, ROI in focus. Agentic AI’s impact on bank productivity and efficiency is likely to exceed expectations from Bloomberg Intelligence’s late-2024 generative AI survey. Banking prepares for agentic AI transformation. Bloomberg Intelligence’s late-2024 survey highlights a growing divide between early AI adopters and laggards: nearly 50% of banks expect lower costs in the next 3-5 years (half predict a 5-10%drop), while more than 40% expect rising costs, with 15% of respondents by over 10%. Agentic AI represents a step-change: it combines reasoning, planning and execution using real-time, unstructured data, enabling end-to-end automation. Banks that invest in the right data infrastructure, orchestration frameworks and governance can shift to fully autonomous operations from digital-support systems, redefining scale, speed and service in the next decade. ROI on AI may gain focus with agents push. Agentic AI — enabling more autonomous, end-to-end processes — may have an even greater impact on productivity, than at least a 5% lift from generative AI over the next 3-5 years expected by respondents in our November survey. The potential benefits of agentic AI are driving a surge in funding, with even more capital likely as adoption scales. Mentions of AI agents — acting autonomously in areas like lead generation, compliance and operations — on earnings calls rose 4x in 4Q24, according to CB Insights, reflecting rising executive focus. This agent-based structure enables scalable, efficient and auditable automation-highlighting investment opportunities in AI orchestration, lending infrastructure and vertical financial AI platforms. Job elimination is one of the main concerns around agentic AI, especially in 2-3 years, as it opens up new possibilities for analyzing and predicting more complex, multi-step tasks, while generative AI can replace jobs that are based on repetitive tasks.

The logistics department can initiate the use of a smart inventory management system, moving away from traditional Excel spreadsheets for statistics [and] the sales department can leverage AI algorithms to optimize promotional activities.” Director (large retailer) — China. [...] Key AI enablers: Proactive AI support (e.g. “your product needs maintenance”), frictionless returns, personalized loyalty rewards.\nThe 3 foundational layers The empowered workforce: AI as a companion for every employee At every stage of the customer&#x27;s journey, a human employee — from the store associate to the marketer — is augmented by AI. They have the data and tools to provide exceptional service, creativity, and support.\nThe bedrock of trust: Governance as a strategic advantage Trust is not a final step; it is the prerequisite for the entire journey. Without a foundation of ethical AI, data privacy, and transparency, customers (and their agents) will not engage. [...] Treat your data as a product: Your enterprise data is no longer just an internal asset. It is now a product you serve to external agents. If your product, inventory, and pricing data is not impeccably structured and machine-readable in real-time, your brand will be invisible in the agentic economy.\nEngineer for trust in a machine-to-machine world: Governance is no longer just about human trust. Your AI must be programmed to be a fair and transparent negotiator with your customer’s AI agent. This requires investing in Explainable AI (XAI) to ensure your pricing and recommendations can win in machine-to-machine interactions.&quot;,

Ensure Good Corporate Governance Teams typically delight in the opportunity to streamline tedious and time-consuming work through automation. However, unfettered access to automation tools can lead to challenges that impact your key business systems. For example, a large number of people working in an application at the same time can impact its performance, and the same is true for robots.\nSimilarly, a large number of robots could infringe upon license agreements. Good governance is critical to such situations. [...] Depending on your automation requirements, you might build several VMs or hundreds of VMs for robots to run on.\nSee Specify Where a Robot Runs • Associating each environment with exactly one environment pool.\nFor example, you might have an environment pool for human resources robots, another for finance robots, and so on.\nSee Add Computers to an Environment Pool.\n• Installing and managing the robot agent on each environment.\nSee About the Robot Agent.\nAbout the Robot Agent Install one or more robot agents on each environment.

APIs can send most of the data to your HCM software, but APIs aren&#x27;t available for sending the emergency contact information.

[...] Modern pay equity workflows extend beyond compliance reporting to become proactive planning tools.  Sophisticated platforms conduct automated equity scans that segment pay by protected characteristics while controlling for legitimate factors like job level, function, location, performance ratings, and tenure. Statistical analyses can identify patterns that might indicate systemic bias, flagging groups or roles for closer review before issues become legal risks. [...] Integration and Configuration\n\nIntegration and configuration activities establish connections between the platform and existing systems while building the job architecture, user roles, and workflow templates that will guide ongoing operations.  HRIS and payroll integrations should be tested thoroughly to ensure accurate data flow, appropriate field mapping, and reliable automation.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Which development platforms and tools should you learn ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] Developers should look beyond today’s job specifications and anticipate where demand is likely to grow over the next few years. As more enterprise platforms deliver agentic AI capabilities, there will be a shift in what businesses will develop themselves and which platforms they invest in.\n\n“When evaluating where to build skills, developers should look beyond tools and focus on ecosystems that foster learning, collaboration, and adaptability,” says Gloria Ramchandani, SVP of product at Copado. “Choose platforms that encourage experimentation across low-code, automation, and cloud development, because the future favors hybrid roles that blend creativity, technical depth, and soft skills. Invest in communities where you can learn from peers, share best practices, and grow with technology.” [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises. Some enterprise SaaS platforms with extended development capabilities include SAP, Salesforce, and Workday. Here’s a primer on the breadth of their development capabilities.\n\nDevelopers should also consider learning enterprise-ready low-code platforms that embrace AI, such as Appian, OutSystems, Pega, and Quickbase.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The road ahead As AI and Gen AI advance and proliferate to unlock unprecedented advantages, global mobility is poised to take its services, results and strategic value to exciting new heights. Forward-thinking organizations are capitalizing on AI’s transformative power, navigating its complexities and opportunities with a focus on trust, ethics and readiness. As organizations embrace AI, they will be wise to keep the big picture in focus — ensuring a vision for new opportunities and solutions that AI can deliver as the future unfolds and its power evolves. The AI journey underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation to consistently evolve the employee experience, workflow automation and mobility’s advisory role to the business. [...] At the same time, the business is tapping into AI to implement workplace changes that optimize product and process design, supplier interactions, and overall business efficiency. AI is accelerating human resources processes, for example, as an HR workspace agent. Where employees previously submitted an IT support ticket for help and recommendations, AI now handles those requests, instantly providing support and recommendations. Turnaround time for support has been dramatically reduced. The organization provides mandatory AI training and remains careful to include human support, combining ‘bots and brains’ at all times as reliance on AI grows. It is also conducting an initiative to promote the use of AI and the business-wide sharing of AI agents that are advancing mobility’s self-service [...] its diverse operations and enhance business efficiency. In today’s hypercompetitive environment, speed is essential. The company’s mobility team had once spent about 100 hours coordinating with legal, HR, immigration, and compliance after an employee, requested temporary employment in a third country without residing or working there. The time and complexity of managing this unusual assignment highlighted the need to accelerate and streamline mobility processes, leading the business to adopt an AI-powered solution with advanced automation to improve efficiency. Automation is now breaking new ground in managing massive volumes of widely dispersed data across the organization’s 50-plus global sites. The company is now gaining unprecedented data insights and predictive analytics through four&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Looking ahead, Harris expects the interfaces themselves to evolve beyond pure conversation. \&quot;We&#x27;re kind of saturating what we can do with purely conversational UIs,\&quot; he said. \&quot;I think we&#x27;ll start to see agents building an interface that best suits your intent, as opposed to trying to surface something within a conversational interface that matches your intent.\&quot;\n\nMicrosoft, Google, and a growing roster of AI startups are placing similar bets — that the winning enterprise AI will be the one embedded in the tools workers already use, not another application to learn. The race to become that invisible layer of workplace intelligence is now fully underway. [...] Salesforce has framed the pricing change as standard industry practice.\n\n## What Slackbot can do today, what&#x27;s coming in weeks, and what&#x27;s still on the roadmap\n\nThe new Slackbot begins rolling out today and will reach all eligible customers by the end of February. Mobile availability will complete by March 3, Bauer confirmed during her interview with VentureBeat.\n\nSome capabilities remain works in progress. Calendar reading and availability checking are available at launch, but the ability to actually book meetings is \&quot;coming a few weeks after,\&quot; according to Seaman. Image generation is not currently supported, though Bauer said it&#x27;s \&quot;something that we are looking at in the future.\&quot; [...] Harris put it more directly: \&quot;If you&#x27;ve ever had that magic experience with AI — I think ChatGPT is a great example, it&#x27;s a great experience from a consumer perspective — Slackbot is really what we&#x27;re doing in the enterprise, to be this employee super agent that is loved, just like people love using Slack.\&quot;\n\nAmy Bauer emphasized the frictionless nature of the experience. \&quot;Slackbot is inherently grounded in the context, in the data that you have in Slack,\&quot; she said. \&quot;So as you continue working in Slack, Slackbot gets better because it&#x27;s grounded in the work that you&#x27;re doing there. There is no setup. There is no configuration for those end users.\&quot;\n\n## Salesforce&#x27;s ambitious plan to make Slackbot the one &#x27;super agent&#x27; that controls all the others&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;Model flexibility: We&#x27;re model-agnostic by design. Teams don&#x27;t have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That&#x27;s difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;Platform neutrality: Kilo isn&#x27;t trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\&quot;\n\n## The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem first\n\nKilo&#x27;s launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built. [...] \&quot;We don&#x27;t think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\&quot; he said. \&quot;OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they&#x27;ll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn&#x27;t generating code, it&#x27;s integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\&quot;\n\nHe outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate:\n\n\&quot;Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\&quot; [...] With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request.\n\nA typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \&quot;@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\&quot;\n\nThe bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack.&quot;,

In order to manage change, business leaders must get the most value out of their data and put insights into the hands of the workforce, empowering everyone in the organisation to make more informed decisions. Unfortunately, companies are struggling to put their data to work, leaving a valuable organisational asset largely untapped. McKinsey &amp; Company has found that employees across a range of functions can spend around a third of their time on non-value added tasks due to poor data quality and inefficient processes for sourcing, aggregating, reconciling and cleansing data, in addition to manual reporting.1 Workday Prism Analytics addresses these challenges for both finance and HR, while helping IT&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workday Podcast: How Comcast Turns Data Into Insights With Workday Prism Analytics | Workday US&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;incredibly helpful for other things. So now, we took that data set and we are combining it with our recruiting data so that we can see, \&quot;Okay. Here&#x27;s a fill. This is the person that is tied to that fill and all of the data associated with that person.\&quot; Likewise, we are looking at it from a succession perspective, and we can say, \&quot;Okay. Well, here&#x27;s a pool of succession candidates. Here are the jobs that they have taken over the past X number of months.\&quot; And we can tell were they or were they not the successor for those jobs. And by pulling that data into Prism and then by joining it with the data that&#x27;s sitting in our version of trended worker, we&#x27;re able to do a lot of stuff that, that ties back basically to the root data behind HR, which is person, hires, moves, terms. [...] of data that we were going to have to take in from other sources or send out to other sources, Prism was a natural fit. And then, we were also using a data warehousing solution from SAP, and that had to be cared for from a replacement perspective. And so Prism was kind of sold to us as the solution for trying to manage the data warehousing needs that we were basically coming from a legacy data perspective. [...] Chang: Sure. So regarding Prism, is, at the end of the day, a, a tool to load data, do stuff to it, and then join it to Workday data and publish it into Workday for reporting purposes. So the most simplistic use case is, \&quot;Hey, I have this external file. I get that file on a regular basis. I need that joined to employee data or compensation data or whatever.\&quot; And so I can import that data through Prism into Workday. I can join it with whatever else I need to join it with. I can secure it however I need to secure it. And then I publish it to Workday to create a report against it, right? So that&#x27;s the most simplistic use case. So, there are cases that we have where we are taking compensation data, and we are basically transforming it so that we have a version of everybody&#x27;s pay for every pay&quot;,

Prism is a powerful tool, it can be a bit confusing and mysterious as an easily misunderstood system but it makes it easy to collect and map data to Workday systems... ## Likes and dislikes about Workday Prism Analytics. Allows a quick mass drop of immense amount of data into a repository that allows us to end the lifecycle with other systems and take our time mapping archaic data into Workday to ensure we have a great view of historical information that precedes the date of usage of Workday ...... While in concept it is powerful, there is a degree of inflexibility when it comes to pushing data from Prism into core.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For Anthropic, the product’s early traction could eventually pave the way for more business customers, expanding on the momentum the OpenAI rival has seen from Claude Code, which reached a $1 billion revenue run rate in just six months.

We have this interesting inflection point where the decisions that we make and the product thinking is probably the difficult part. We can very quickly actually do the engineering.”   \n  \nStill, Rieseberg said AI coding isn’t quite as automated as it seems on the surface. “It’s not just like we go into a dark corner and say, ‘Claude, build a new product,’ and then a week later, it’s launched,” he said. “Humans are in the loop for us.

According to a recent Workday blog, today contingent workers make up roughly 30% of the total workforce in financial services, and that share is projected to rise to 50% within the next few years. [...] ## Continuous innovation and industry alignment\n\nAs part of the broader Workday ecosystem, VNDLY benefits from the same continuous innovation model that underpins Workday’s cloud applications. The platform is regularly enhanced in collaboration with clients to help address emerging needs in services procurement, statement of work (SOW) management, and reporting depth—areas of particular importance in the financial services sector.\n\nThis commitment to client-led innovation helps make sure that VNDLY evolves in parallel with the complex regulatory and operational demands of the industry. For financial institutions, it means future-ready functionality that scales as workforce strategies mature.\n\n## From cost control to competitive advantage&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Data-Driven Compensation Planning Tool: How HR Teams ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Modern real-time datasets offer granular segmentation by detailed job titles, job families, experience levels, and U.S. metropolitan areas or broader regional clusters. Advanced platforms like SalaryCube’s Bigfoot Live provide daily-updated benchmarks with transparent methodology documentation and sample size disclosure, ensuring HR teams can evaluate data quality and make defendable decisions. The ability to price hybrid or emerging roles through AI-assisted job matching addresses the growing challenge of compensation benchmarking for positions that don’t fit traditional survey categories.\n\nInternal HRIS and Payroll Data\n\nInternal HRIS and payroll data must flow automatically into planning workflows rather than requiring manual uploads each cycle.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Financial services is one vertical where customers have realised the imperative of the move, she says. The move was a “no-brainer” for Pillay, and offered data analysis, AI, agentic AI, and GenAI capabilities. She says if a customer isn’t speaking to SAP about the move, it may well be too late to get a system installed before the cut-off date.\n\n“We’re prioritising helping those who are speaking to us to make that decision. We have to work with every customer individually to understand how they can do that transformation. There are different routes, based on capacity, budget and risk appetite. If you delay a decision, it’s going to be too late.” [...] All this became obsolete with the introduction of ERP systems, “because now all that stuff is in the SAP system”. “There’s an application, and you click on it, and it scans the database and pays the overdue suppliers, given the payment terms and the contractual agreements. Accountants still exist and have more work than ever before, but they just do an entirely different job. A lot of the work that is being done today, in accruals, for example, will go away, but there is so much more work that they can do, because the world is getting more complex.\n\n“There are tons of challenges that we can solve. And it will allow humans to move on and really use what humans are good at, which is to design the next level of the evolution of history, based on AI.” [...] “We provide AI in the toolchain, to help the customer convert the custom code, to either get rid of it, or convert it, so there’s a clean core, with compliant code. Big customers have 500 systems or so, and that’s a big undertaking. It’s almost like moving an entire city.”\n\nIN THE BEGINNING&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Control-M - Application And Data Workflow Orchestration - AWS&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Regarding measurable improvements since using Control-M, when jobs fail due to specific errors, I am notified promptly, which is essential for handling issues in the production environment. Instead of manually checking all failed jobs, I configure notifications based on priority, enhancing my time-saving efforts across job management.\n\nThe biggest lesson learned from using Control-M is understanding how jobs get scheduled within minutes and can function independently without intervention. I have gained insights into configuring job properties such as command jobs, file transfers, file watchers, SAP jobs, and more. My extensive experience of over nine years with Control-M offers me great opportunities, and I look forward to improvements, particularly in AI features relevant to Control-M. [...] #### What needs improvement?\n\nFor improvements, there is some slowness in terms of logging, as Control-M can be a heavy tool that could benefit from reducing file size. Overall, the tool is great, but it would be helpful if it were lighter and easier to use in my daily operations. In my non-prod environment, I notice significant lag, making it difficult to work effectively. Enhancing the tool&#x27;s speed and perhaps integrating AI-related features could significantly benefit daily activities. [...] Control-M is used to connect to Oracle products, and through Control-M, a Tableau dashboard is maintained. Most of the scheduling jobs use Control-M to schedule. Control-M helps all products, making it a utility that can be used wherever scheduling features are needed. It is not just for DevOps, databases, or front-end applications; it can be used anywhere without manual intervention to perform particular activities. Wherever there is an opportunity for scheduling jobs, Control-M is the first option.&quot;,

With Joule integrated into the maintenance notification process in SAP Cloud ERP, creating and screening notifications becomes more straightforward and accessible. Users can describe an issue in natural language and capture key details such as the technical object, priority, and description without navigating complex transaction flows. Moreover, users can access notifications in the ‘Manage Maintenance Notification’ SAP Fiori app (F5777), enabling quick acceptance and conversion into maintenance orders within a single conversational context. As a result, operators spend less time on [...] In the area of Retail, Joule’s integration into assortment module management supports planners by making common tasks more accessible and less time-consuming. Instead of navigating multiple screens, users can rely on natural language interactions to create, update, or terminate assortments directly within the application. This reduces dependency on deep technical knowledge and helps teams complete routine tasks with greater confidence and efficiency. As a result, merchandising and category managers can spend less time on operational steps and more time focusing on assortment strategy and customer-centric planning.\n\nFor more information, please consult SAP Help Portal.\n\n### \n\n### Asset Management\n\n### Maintenance notification creation and screening with Joule&quot;,

In the context of generative and agentic AI, governance answers critical questions:\n\nServiceNow operationalizes governance through AI Control Tower by centralizing AI governance, policies, roles, and approvals in one system of record, where AI use cases are registered, classified, assessed, approved, and monitored. Governance becomes a living control system, not a static policy document.\n\nMap:\n\nThe Map function establishes context.

ServiceNow supports this by embedding assessment workflows, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring directly into operations.\n\nManage\n\nManaging AI risk is not about eliminating risk, it is about making informed decisions.\n\nOrganizations may: [...] Mapping includes:\n\nThere is no point in deploying AI without clearly understanding what it is supposed to accomplish. It also involves defining all stakeholders and roles, understanding how they interact with the system, and identifying where risk may be introduced or reduced. Risk tolerance is also defined here, recognizing that tolerance varies by organization and by use case. ServiceNow enables this through structured intake, stakeholder mapping, and lifecycle visibility.\n\nMeasure\n\nMeasurement is where AI risk becomes tangible.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;ServiceNow helps to improve IT incident handling in a more comprehensive way. The latest version provides extensive information, and they have introduced AI which allows us to program it in such a way that our L1 support can be eliminated. That is what we are currently working on. It gives very comprehensive details. If it is a repetitive incident or a new incident which has already been remediated by somebody else, that is what we are building the AI element or AI agent to handle.\n\n#### What needs improvement?\n\nTo make ServiceNow better, they should reduce their pricing, especially because there&#x27;s a lot of competition. Many customers have moved to ManageEngine because they cannot afford the license cost.\n\nThe price should be reduced by at least 40%. [...] Listing Thumbnail\n\n# ServiceNow on AWS\n\n## Overview\n\nServiceNow products hosted on AWS as well as ServiceNow integrations with AWS help bridge the gap between the cloud of today and the cloud of tomorrow. With ServiceNow on AWS you can: 1. Digitize your business and deliver great employee and customer experiences 2. Drive greater efficiencies and reduce technical debt across the enterprise 3. Create new and resilient ways of working through a unified experience. [...] This is the first solution I have been using for incident management and production issues. I never used any tool before.\n\n#### How was the initial setup?\n\nWe never evaluated any other options. ServiceNow is the enterprise standard solution for incident management in our organization, and it was chosen when we started this project.\n\n#### What other advice do I have?\n\nServiceNow is one of the best tools in the industry for production support people, for incident and production ticket management. It is also a very good tool for any kind of change records and production deployments. The voice interaction feature is a very good idea, and I really appreciated it. I would rate this product a nine out of ten.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot \&quot;an absolute &#x27;chaos tamer&#x27; for our team,\&quot; estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily \&quot;just by eliminating context switching.\&quot;\n\n## Slackbot vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Google Gemini: The fight for enterprise AI dominance\n\nThe launch puts Salesforce in direct competition with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot, which is integrated into Teams and the broader Microsoft 365 suite, as well as Google&#x27;s Gemini integrations across Workspace. When asked what distinguishes Slackbot from these alternatives, Seaman pointed to context and convenience. [...] Looking ahead, Harris expects the interfaces themselves to evolve beyond pure conversation. \&quot;We&#x27;re kind of saturating what we can do with purely conversational UIs,\&quot; he said. \&quot;I think we&#x27;ll start to see agents building an interface that best suits your intent, as opposed to trying to surface something within a conversational interface that matches your intent.\&quot;\n\nMicrosoft, Google, and a growing roster of AI startups are placing similar bets — that the winning enterprise AI will be the one embedded in the tools workers already use, not another application to learn. The race to become that invisible layer of workplace intelligence is now fully underway. [...] The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce&#x27;s most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging \&quot;agentic AI\&quot; movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.\n\n\&quot;Slackbot isn&#x27;t just another copilot or AI assistant,\&quot; said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack&#x27;s chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. \&quot;It&#x27;s the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce.\&quot;\n\n## From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Anthropic&#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot\n\nThe launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.\n\nHowever, Anthropic&#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application. [...] All Posts\n\n# Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required\n\nMichael Nuñez\n\nAnthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.\n\nThe launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools. [...] Cowork doesn&#x27;t operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic&#x27;s existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.\n\nAdditionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic&#x27;s browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises. Some enterprise SaaS platforms with extended development capabilities include SAP, Salesforce, and Workday. Here’s a primer on the breadth of their development capabilities.\n\nDevelopers should also consider learning enterprise-ready low-code platforms that embrace AI, such as Appian, OutSystems, Pega, and Quickbase. [...] Software development used to be simpler, with fewer choices about which platforms and languages to learn. You were either a Java, .NET, or LAMP developer. You focused on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Full-stack developers learned the intricacies of selected JavaScript frameworks, relational databases, and CI/CD tools.\n\nIn the best of times, developers advanced their technology skills with their employer’s funding and time to experiment. They attended conferences, took courses, and learned the low-code development platforms their employers invested in.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All Posts\n\n# Why Sakana AI’s big win is a big deal for the future of enterprise agents\n\nBen Dickson\n\nIn an impressive feat, Japanese startup Sakana AI’s coding agent ALE-Agent recently secured first place in the AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC058), a complex coding competition that involves complicated optimization problems — and a more difficult and perhaps telling challenge than benchmarks like HumanEval, which mostly test the ability to write isolated functions, and which many AI models and agents now regularly pass with ease (\&quot;benchmark saturation\&quot;). [...] \&quot;While smarter algorithms will drive efficiency, the primary value of AI is its ability to explore vast solution spaces,\&quot; the Sakana AI team said. \&quot;As inference costs fall, rather than simply banking the savings, enterprises will likely choose to leverage that affordability to conduct even deeper, broader searches to find superior solutions.\&quot;\n\nThe experiment highlights the immense value still to be unlocked through inference-time scaling techniques. As AI systems gain the ability to handle complex reasoning tasks across longer contexts, building better scaffolding and allocating larger budgets for \&quot;thinking time\&quot; allows agents to rival top human experts.\n\n## More [...] Sakana&#x27;saccomplishment with ALE-Agent hints at a shift toward agents capable of autonomously optimizing themselves to navigate and perform well in complex, dynamic systems such as enterprise software stacks, workflows, and operational environments.\n\nIn four hours, the agent used inference-time scaling to generate, test, and iterate over hundreds of solutions, solving a problem that typically requires deep intuition and time-consuming trial and error from human experts. It outperformed over 800 human participants, including top-tier competitive programmers.\n\n## How ALE-Agent works&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Which development platforms and tools should you learn ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises. Some enterprise SaaS platforms with extended development capabilities include SAP, Salesforce, and Workday. Here’s a primer on the breadth of their development capabilities.\n\nDevelopers should also consider learning enterprise-ready low-code platforms that embrace AI, such as Appian, OutSystems, Pega, and Quickbase. [...] Only now are many developers realizing they must radically upskill due to new AI capabilities. Others may be out of work and should use the time to develop new skills to improve their employability. AI is taking a bite out of employment, and more than 100,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2025, according to layoffs.fyi.\n\nAs more coding is done with code generators, vibe coding tools, and low-code automation platforms, the choice of what to learn isn’t straightforward.\n\n## Gauging the market for new skills\n\nShould developers follow their passions and interests? Or is it more pragmatic to review what skills and certifications are in demand and focus your learning in these areas?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \&quot;MiniMax&#x27;s recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\&quot;\n\nHe emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \&quot;MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\&quot; he said. \&quot;In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year&#x27;s re:Invent keynote, showing they&#x27;re ready for enterprise use at scale.\&quot; [...] The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax&#x27;s M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models.\n\n## How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chat\n\nThe integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor. [...] ## Inside the $29 billion \&quot;vibe coding\&quot; market that Kilo wants to disrupt\n\nKilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \&quot;vibe coding,\&quot; a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft&#x27;s codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor&#x27;s November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Which development platforms and tools should you learn ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises. Some enterprise SaaS platforms with extended development capabilities include SAP, Salesforce, and Workday. Here’s a primer on the breadth of their development capabilities.\n\nDevelopers should also consider learning enterprise-ready low-code platforms that embrace AI, such as Appian, OutSystems, Pega, and Quickbase. [...] Developers must also explore how to use generative AI tools to write agile requirements, develop software, automate testing, maintain documentation, and drive other efficiencies across the software development life cycle (SDLC). Developer experiences are evolving from IDEs focused on writing code to natural language dialogs, code validation tools, and AI agents performing development tasks.\n\n“AI SDLC tools are just another new way for developers to use powerful assistants in their development pipelines, much like the modern IDE,” says Simon Margolis, associate CTO of AI and machine learning at SADA. “The developer’s core goal doesn’t change: applying logic to command tools, whether using English and Gemini CLI or writing Python directly.”\n\n## Diving into SaaS and low-code development&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As a security best practice, we recommend that you enable MCP servers only for the services required for your AI application to function.\n\n### Disable the Google SecOps MCP server in a project\n\nTo disable the Google SecOps MCP server in your Google Cloud project, run the following command:\n\n```\n      \\  =\n```\n\nThe Google SecOps MCP server is disabled for use in your Google Cloud project.\n\n## Authentication and authorization\n\nGoogle SecOps MCP servers use the OAuth 2.0 protocol with Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication and authorization. All Google Cloud identities are supported for authentication to MCP servers. [...] AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Gemini CLI, can instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. To connect to a remote MCP server, the MCP client must know at a minimum the URL of the remote MCP server.\n\nIn your AI application, look for a way to connect to a remote MCP server. You are prompted to enter details about the server, such as its name and URL.\n\nFor the Google SecOps MCP server, enter the following as required: [...] ```&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“We’ve developed automations with Workato that just work behind the scenes, saving us hundreds of hours and minimizing errors.”\n\n-Alex Fishler, Head of Business Systems\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNextdoor isn’t stopping here. They’re exploring AI-powered automations, particularly for usage-based billing. As Alex notes, “It’s exciting to see Workato, Workday, ChatGPT all working together to accomplish a job and eliminate a lot of these manual touch points.”\n\nThis forward-thinking approach, powered by Workato’s flexibility, positions Nextdoor for continued growth and innovation. The transformation they’ve achieved—from fragmented systems to a cohesive, agile operation—wouldn’t have been possible without Workato’s integration capabilities. [...] Autonomous Revenue ProcessesAutonomous Revenue Processes\nAutonomous Revenue Processes\n\nExample 2: Real-time Recruiting Performance Monitoring\n\nChallenge: With recruiters needing timely insight to measure performance, Nextdoor struggled with data visibility from its recruiting software, Greenhouse, into the HR systems managed in Workday.\n\nSolution: Utilizing Workato and Workday’s Prism Analytics, Nextdoor set up an automated data flow from Greenhouse into Workday. Data on candidates, interviews, and recruiter performance metrics are pulled into Workday, where they are analyzed and displayed in dashboards.\n\nNow, recruiters and HR leaders have instant access to performance data, enabling them to track progress and adjust strategies in real-time. [...] “Workato offers empowerment—allowing us to independently act fast and iterate without cumbersome development cycles. We have yet to find something that Workato can’t tackle.”\n\n-Alex Fishler, Head of Business Systems\n\nAs Nextdoor continues to connect neighbors, Workato ensures their internal operations are just as seamlessly connected.\n\n## Ready to Transform Your Business?\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n## How Novatti Shakes Up Fintech with 99.9% Faster Merchant Onboarding\n\nASX-listed fintech leader Novatti supports businesses across Australia and New Zealand with an award-winning suite of flexible payment solutions —…\n\n## How Samsara Used AI Agents to Redefine IT and Employee Experience&quot;,

Empowering HR and Workforce Automation: Workato and Workday Unite for Seamless Integration and Custom Workflows. * Workday Integrations: A Beginner’s Guide. * 7 Workday automations that can transform the employee experience. ## About Workday. ## Workday and Workato. Workato’s integration platform allows you to connect and automate workflows between many software applications, including Workday. 1. When you add, remove, or update an employee in Workday, Workato can send the information to Active Directory to create, disable, or change the account. 2. Workato integrates with ServiceNow and OutSystems, so when a new employee is added to Workday, it can add them to these systems. For example, you can pass an update to an employee in ServiceNow to their Workday records, too. 4. Workato supports approval steps, so you can pass changes to managers for approval before synchronizing them into or out of Workday. 1. Workato can synchronize adds, moves, and changes from Workday to ADP. 3. You can upload Workday reports to an SQL database. For example, a workflow can incorporate an approval step when creating a ServiceNow user for a new employee in Workday. Workday Integrations: A Beginner’s Guide. 7 Workday automations that can transform the employee experience. How it works: Triggers on position change in Workday Check that the user does not already exists in Active Directory Add user in AD Search for groups that this position should be a member of Add user to new groups Visit:. * Sync employees from Workday to Oracle EBS.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workday Integrations: 7 Must-Have Workflows to Supercharge Your HR&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;With intelligent automation, you can easily gather feedback without any manual work. For example, let’s say you want to see how recently hired employees feel about their onboarding experience. Workato can automatically send a SurveyMonkey survey to each new hire whenever that user is created on Workday. You could even send the survey two weeks after the employee’s start date, so they have time to experience the full onboarding process.\n\nYou can automatically deploy surveys based on any trigger. Whether you want to collect feedback on catered lunches or find out how satisfied employees are with development opportunities, you can easily get the information you need!\n\n### 4) Automate provisioning with integrated identity access management [...] HR staff often need to access timesheet information. This information can help determine the actual PTO that an employee has accrued, for example. When it’s not up-to-date, you can’t get a truly 360° view of your employees.\n\nA Workato recipe can easily move this information from an app like Replicon into Workday with no manual work. The automation can either run in real-time—updating every time an employee clocks in or out—or on a schedule so it updates employee hours at your desired interval, such as every Friday at 5:00 PM.\n\n### 7) Offboard employees securely and quickly [...] Intelligent automation can help bridge the gap between Workday and your other apps, from finance to IT Ops and beyond. Not sure where to start? Here are seven Workday workflow automations that will change the way you use the platform  forever!\n\nRelated: The different types of HR automation you can implement\n\n### 1) Keep your job postings accurate and up to date&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Enable Web Search for your agent\n\nThe Web Search setting on the Generative AI settings page lets your agent access broad, real-time, and up-to-date information beyond what is available in predefined or enterprise-specific knowledge bases. This setting requires that the agent has generative orchestration turned on.\n\nWhen turned on, Web Search triggers when a user&#x27;s question might benefit from information on the web. It searches all public websites indexed by Bing. This type of search happens in parallel with any searches of public websites you added as knowledge sources. Results from Web Search are interleaved with results from your configured public website knowledge sources.\n\nNote\n\nWeb Search uses Grounding with Bing Search to return information from the web. [...] ## Allow the agent to use general knowledge\n\nThe Use general knowledge setting on the Generative AI settings page configures your agent to use generative AI. This setting requires that the agent has generative orchestration turned on.\n\nGenerative AI includes general knowledge, which refers to the foundational knowledge that the generative AI is trained on. When this setting is turned on, it allows your agent to use this general knowledge in its answers. This general knowledge setting means that the agent answers questions unrelated to the domain of your agent. If you prefer that your agent is grounded with your specific knowledge sources only, turn off this setting.\n\n## Tenant graph grounding with semantic search [...] ## Tenant graph grounding with semantic search\n\nThe Tenant graph grounding with semantic search setting on the Generative AI settings page determines whether your agent uses semantic search to improve search results. This setting requires that the agent has generative orchestration turned on.\n\nThis feature requires the agent to share a tenant with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. It also requires that a semantic index is configured for use. To use a semantic index, the Microsoft 365 Copilot license must be assigned to at least one user in the enterprise.\n\nImportant\n\nThe Tenant graph grounding with semantic search feature requires that the agent&#x27;s user authentication is set to Authenticate with Microsoft.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Human-centered AI for ethical and sustainable growth&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### Summary\n\nA human-centered AI approach is essential for sustainable growth in various sectors. By prioritizing ethical guidelines, enabling collaboration, and enhancing employee or user engagement, organizations can effectively navigate the complexities of AI integration. As we embrace the potential of GenAI, it is crucial to uphold the principles of Responsible AI. This approach will help create a future where AI enhances efficiency along with accessibility.\n\nGenAI was used to develop an iteration of this article. In accordance with EY editorial guidelines, the end product was reviewed and edited by EY professionals before publication.\n\nHow EY can help\n\nAI Academy: Empowering GenAI training and talent transformation [...] Encourage an environment that embraces experimentation and creativity. Form cross-functional teams with diverse perspectives to design AI solutions that are both effective and ethically sound.\n\nProvide employees with the skills required to work along with AI technologies. Training programs can improve productivity, while addressing concerns about job displacement, creating a more involved workforce and enhancing employee engagement.\n\nDevelop a comprehensive framework for ethical use of AI. Collaborate with stakeholders to create ethical guidelines that address issues such as bias, privacy, and accountability. Conduct regular audits of AI systems to ensure adherence to these principles. [...] Know more\n\n### Establishing ethical guidelines\n\nEstablishing ethical guidelines for AI development is critical. As AI systems become more advanced in creating content that resembles human work, reliable methods to identify the source of information is essential. This is especially important in fields where accurate information directly impacts crucial decisions. Several AI content detection solutions are emerging, such as watermarking and metadata verification, which can help reduce the risks of misinformation.\n\nThe evolution of AI technologies, including Agentic AI, offers new opportunities for improving business processes, allowing organizations to benefit through improved workflows and comprehensive enterprise automation strategies.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;India&#x27;s workforce reimagined: Preparing organizations for ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While AI enables efficiency gains, it has also contributed to rising workloads. A significant proportion of employees report that work intensity has increased over the past year, suggesting that AI is often layered onto existing roles rather than driving role redesign. At the same time, concerns about the AI impact on jobs remain. These dynamics underscore the importance of responsible AI governance. Although confidence in ethical AI use is high, employees consistently express more caution than employers around transparency, explainability, and data confidentiality. As AI becomes more widely used in workplaces, closing this perception gap will be key to sustaining trust.\n\n### Rewards and priorities [...] Encouragingly, most employees and employers believe workplace culture has improved since 2021. This momentum suggests that organizations are making progress in combining innovation with human-centric values. In AI-driven workforce transformation, culture acts as a stabilizing force—helping employees adapt to change while maintaining engagement and confidence.\n\nUltimately, the survey highlights a clear insight: the link between AI and talent health is undeniable. While technology may drive efficiency, it is culture, learning, and trust that determine whether transformation is sustainable. [...] As workplace misconduct rises, HR must adopt an investigative mindset and structured frameworks to ensure fairness, compliance, and organizational integrity.\n\nArpinder Singh\n\nDesigning an AI-first workforce for the modern enterprise\n\nOur Agentic AI report 2026, chapter 4, explores how enterprises build AI-first workplaces, integrate human-AI collaboration and redefine roles.\n\nMahesh Makhija + 1\n\nAgents and the promise of the infinite digital workforce\n\nAIdea of India: Outlook 2026 chapter 1 explores how Indian enterprises adopt agentic AI to build digital workforces, redesign human-AI collaboration and govern autonomous agents.\n\nMahesh Makhija + 1\n\nAbout this article\n\nRelated topics \n\nWorkforce\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n Link Copied\n\nEY Footer logo&quot;,

With a focus on business value, use cases, impact on workforce and security, the effects of GenAI have far reaching implications. [...] The governance of GenAI should be complementary and aligned with existing governance of AI, data, IT and other areas. In addition, it should be compliant with emerging regulations, such as the EU’s AI Act, as well as with regional, cultural and ethical values.  \n\nTo be effective, GenAI governance should be implemented through clearly defined roles and responsibilities, procedures, communication, awareness sessions and training. It should be further operationalized through practical guidelines and tool support for the development, deployment and monitoring of AI systems. Leading and coordinating AI governance is typically the responsibility of an AI center of excellence, which is owned by senior or C-level leadership and often supported by an advisory board.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### 4. AI won’t do all your thinking for you.\n\nToday’s job roles will be unrecognizable in the enterprise of the future. Already the half-life of human skills is shrinking: 67% of executives in our research say job roles are becoming shorter-lived and 57% expect most current employee skills to become obsolete by 2030.\n\nAs pre-AI workflows become obsolete, employees will need to envision entirely new functions that can manage AI-first operations. Instead of teams of people who use AI to augment individual job roles, they need orchestrators with new skills who can manage AI across multiple domains and integrate insights that span traditional departmental boundaries. [...] The real advantage will come from how organizations design and orchestrate thousands of decentralized AI agents that work alongside employees, each one tuned to the company’s purpose, culture, and competitive edge. Leaders will need to ask: Where should AI augment people—and where should people augment AI? The most successful organizations will reimagine how humans and machines collaborate to achieve more than either could on their own.\n\nThis is the difference between AI-enabled and AI-first. And IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM IBV) research shows this transition is already underway. [...] Roughly two-thirds of executives say agentic AI will play a significant role in finance, sales, marketing, IT, supply chain, and research and development by 2030. These agents generally come in one of two forms: personal agents that empower employees to work smarter and enterprise agents that optimize end-to-end workflows.\n\n&gt; Where should AI augment people—and where should people augment AI?\n\nIn healthcare, for example, 65% of executives say they’re empowering employees to use AI for task automation in their specific roles. It’s now possible for manual validation processes that once took months to be completed in hours. The efficiency gains could free up human expertise for patient-facing work—where empathy, intuition, and complex decision-making remain irreplaceable.&quot;,

The more leaders learn about AI, the more likely they are to understand and harness the transformational nature of AI.\n Commit to meaningful, focused AI corporate investments. Companies should invest decisively in AI and agents in end-to-end workflows.\n Develop workforce capability. Leaders understand that success depends on people and change management, not just technology. They upskill their people early to prepare them for an uncertain future. They also seek to close the confidence gap between CEOs and their subordinates. [...] Many large companies have a new Chief AI Officer—and it’s the CEO. Nearly three quarters of CEOs say that they are their organization’s main decision maker on AI, twice the share as last year.\n\nCEOs are recognizing that AI is more than a technology. It opens the door to a fundamentally different way of running organizations—touching strategy, operations, culture, risk, and talent. In close coordination with their executive team, the CEO is the executive with the authority and perspective to connect those organizational and management dots.\n\nWith so many CEOs taking ownership of the success of their AI initiatives, AI is poised for a consequential year in 2026. So consequential, in fact, that half of CEOs believe that their job is on the line if AI does not pay off. [...] &gt; Trailblazer CEOs are systematic in their approach to AI.\n\nAgents allow employees to take on more responsibilities and make faster decisions. Over time, as they reshape workflows around agents, companies can move away from function-led hierarchies to become flatter and more cross-functional. Decision making will shift from slow approval chains to real-time action as agents and humans work collaboratively.\n\nTrailblazers have been earlier and more assertive in pursuing agents. They are directing more than half of their 2026 AI corporate investments to agents. They are about twice as likely as followers to deploy agents end-to-end across a workstream or process.&quot;,

[...] ## The shift: From passive tools to proactive agents\n\nSince the rise of the modern enterprise, people have managed core business processes across finance, supply chain and manufacturing. Management theorist Gary Hamel has observed that many of the processes still in use today were originally designed during the early Industrial Revolution. Now, many tasks that humans have performed for more than a century -- and which were later embedded within ERP implementations -- are shifting to agentic AI. Here, agents will increasingly take on work across finance and planning, supply chain management and procurement, manufacturing, HR and customer service.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;4 critical misconceptions derailing enterprise AI adoption - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The prevailing narrative attributes these failures to technological inadequacy or insufficient investment. However, this perspective fundamentally misunderstands the problem. My experience reveals another root cause that lies not in the technological aspects themselves, but in strategic and cognitive biases that systematically distort how organizations define readiness and value, manage data, and adopt and operationalize the AI lifecycle.\n\nHere are four critical misconceptions that consistently undermine enterprise AI strategies.\n\n## 1. The organizational readiness illusion [...] Organizations establish foundational capabilities necessary for enterprise-wide AI scaling through comprehensive governance frameworks with clear policies for risk management, compliance and ethical AI use. Organizations must invest in talent and upskilling initiatives that develop AI literacy across leadership and technical teams, closing capability gaps. Cultural transformation proves equally critical-organizations must foster a data-driven, innovation-friendly environment supported by tailored change management practices. Critically, organizations must shift from traditional DevOps toward a Dev-GenAI-Biz-Ops lifecycle that integrates development, generative AI capabilities, business stakeholder engagement and operations in a unified workflow. This expanded paradigm acknowledges that AI [...] Organizations must ensure data availability, quality, privacy and regulatory compliance across the enterprise. This stage involves implementing modern data architecture-whether centralized or federated-supported by robust governance frameworks including lineage tracking, security protocols and ethical AI principles. Critically, organizations must adopt data democratization concepts that make quality data accessible across organizational boundaries while maintaining appropriate governance and security controls. Data democratization breaks down silos that traditionally restrict data access to specialized teams, enabling cross-functional teams to leverage AI effectively. The infrastructure must support not only centralized data engineering teams but also distributed business users who can&quot;,

Organizations that swiftly adapt their management playbook to make full use of this transformative technology will gain the edge.\n\nLearn More [...] ## The “People Factor” Is the Key to Successful IT Modernization\n\nAI technology and zero-based methods are critical tools for core IT modernization, but the impact of people and process management, as in any transformation, is massive. While many insurance executives understand this, they nonetheless struggle with managing these aspects of modernization.\n\nIndeed, leading insurers already know the 10-20-70 rule: that 10% of a program’s efforts should focus on algorithms, 20% on technology and data, and the remaining 70% on people and processes. [...] Despite the formidable—and transformative—capabilities of AI technologies, nearly three-quarters of all legacy modernization efforts still fail. With an implementation as complex as core modernization, it is easy for companies to become preoccupied with the technology and lose sight of the broader organizational aspects. This largely explains why siloed decision making, unclear accountabilities, and traditional waterfall delivery models still prevail.\n\nGood governance enables convergence. The goal is not control, but to promote alignment and reuse—and thus speed—across entities through a federated model, based on joint prioritization, central design, and local adoption.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI issues hitting HR from ‘everywhere at once,’ former EEOC chair says | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Algorithmic bias,” as the concept is known, can take a number of forms and can occur even when the employer or the AI tool vendor hasn’t taken any intentionally discriminatory actions.\n\nFor example, algorithmic bias could occur if the data used to train an AI tool instructs it to pull information that includes criminal records, Shuntich said. Using an individual’s criminal history in making employment decisions may result in race, color or national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to an EEOC enforcement guidance. In addition, some states have “ban the box” laws that restrict how employers can use a person’s criminal history in making an employment decision. [...] A third form of bias centers on access issues for disabled applicants or candidates. One scenario involves using an AI assessment as part of the selection process, which may cause problems for people with visual or auditory impairments, Shuntich pointed out.\n\nThe bottom line: Employers should be mindful of the way their AI tools can affect people with disabilities, she said. An EEOC guidance from last year on AI and the Americans with Disabilities Act provides examples. Employers should also remember that disabled individuals have the right to ask for a reasonable accommodation, Shuntich added.\n\nEmployers can take steps to guard against bias and potential liability, the panelists emphasized. These start with notice and consent. [...] When employers talk to their vender, they should have the vendor explain how the AI tool will accomplish what the employer wants it to accomplish, how the tool’s features are job-related and how the employer will be able to explain job-relatedness down the road.\n\nAlso, employers should make sure to have key issues delineated in a written agreement with the vendor. This includes addressing indemnification, future access to needed data, and the duty to notify the employer if the vendor learns of bias through its own testing or from another tool user.\n\nRemember, “you, as the employer,” will be on the hook for discrimination, Dunleavy said.\n\n purchase licensing rights\n\nFiled Under: Compliance,  HR Tech &amp; Analytics\n\n### HR Dive news delivered to your inbox&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EEOC Guidance on AI | Practical Law The Journal | Reuters&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This guidance, along with the Joint Statement on Enforcement Efforts Against Discrimination and Bias in Automated Systems (jointly issued by the EEOC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, and the Federal Trade Commission), forms the backbone of the EEOC’s position on AI in employment.\n\n## Why should employers care about the most recent guidance from the EEOC on AI?\n\nEmployers should pay close attention to the EEOC’s guidance because it identifies the AI use:\n\nSpecifically, the May 18, 2023 technical assistance document:\n\nPastel speech bubbles indicating a conversation among and analysis by legal industry thought leaders. [...] ## Why is the EEOC interested in AI?\n\nThe EEOC enforces and provides guidance on federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of certain protected characteristics. Part of the EEOC’s mandate is to consider whether the use of new technologies facilitates or causes discrimination and to help curb those risks with guidance to all stakeholders.\n\nIn October 2021, the EEOC launched the Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative (Initiative). Its stated goal is to ensure that AI and other emerging tools used in employment decisions comply with federal civil rights laws. In the EEOC’s view, AI could potentially be used by employers to engage in discrimination, intentionally or unintentionally. [...] ##### Under the four-fifths rule, an employer can evaluate whether an AI-enabled tool is making substantially different distinctions along racial or other lines by looking at the numbers.\n\nFor example, the guidance addresses the following issues:\n\n## What kinds of technology may be implicated by the EEOC’s AI guidance?\n\nEmployers use many different kinds of technology in the hiring and promotion process, so it may be easy to overlook certain tools that are implicated by the EEOC’s guidance. Although not an exhaustive list, the EEOC has provided a list of the types of technological resources to consider when reviewing compliance in light of this guidance, which includes:\n\n## What are some best practices employers should adopt when using AI in the workplace?&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EEOC takes aim at bias in workplace AI, algorithm tools | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agency began its foray against tech-borne bias no later than 2016, when it held a public meeting to examine the implications of big data on the workplace.\n\nMore recently, EEOC Commissioner Keith Sonderling warned employers attending an April 2021 American Bar Association conference that hiring tech tools create discrimination risks. He urged attendees to evaluate algorithms \&quot;early and often for biased outcomes and reengineer as appropriate.\&quot;\n\nSonderling hinted at future activity from the agency on the matter. He declared that EEOC \&quot;must be a leader in this area\&quot; and encouraged attendees to reach out if they thought the agency \&quot;should provide guidance on specific issues relating to bias in technology.\&quot; [...] HR Dive\n\n# Don&#x27;t miss tomorrow&#x27;s HR industry news\n\nLet HR Dive&#x27;s free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.\n\nHR Dive\nmenu\nsearch\n\nsearch\nclose search\nsite logo\n\n# EEOC takes aim at bias in workplace AI, algorithm tools\n\nKatie Clarey&#x27;s headshot\nShare this article\nCopy link\nEmail this page\nPost to LinkedIn\nPost on X\nShare on Facebook\nPrint this page\nLicense this article\nSet preferred source\nA workplace poster published by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is displayed featuring the EEOC logo.\n\n### Dive Brief:\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nEEOC&#x27;s commitment is only the most recent action in a series of steps the agency has taken to enforce anti-discrimination laws in the evolving arena of employment technology. [...] A few months later, Sonderling detailed how microtargeting employment ads can run afoul of anti-discrimination laws in an HR Dive opinion piece. The ads allow advertisers to select specific audiences, and that creates \&quot;significant implications under federal civil rights law, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, or genetic information,\&quot; Sonderling wrote.\n\nThe EEOC also said it offered its systemic investigators an \&quot;extensive training\&quot; this year. The course covered the use of AI in employment practices, according to the agency.\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\nPost to LinkedIn\nShare on Facebook\nPost to X\nPrint this page\nEmail this page\nLicense this article\n\n### HR Dive news delivered to your inbox&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EEOC Launches Initiative on Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As part of the new initiative, the EEOC plans to:\n\n   Establish an internal working group to coordinate the agency’s work on the initiative;\n   Launch a series of listening sessions with key stakeholders about algorithmic tools and their employment ramifications;\n   Gather information about the adoption, design, and impact of hiring and other employment-related technologies;\n   Identify promising practices; and\n   Issue technical assistance to provide guidance on algorithmic fairness and the use of AI in employment decisions. [...] “Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making tools have great potential to improve our lives, including in the area of employment,” Burrows said. “At the same time, the EEOC is keenly aware that these tools may mask and perpetuate bias or create new discriminatory barriers to jobs. We must work to ensure that these new technologies do not become a high-tech pathway to discrimination.”\n\nThe initiative will examine more closely how technology is fundamentally changing the way employment decisions are made. It aims to guide applicants, employees, employers, and technology vendors in ensuring that these technologies are used fairly, consistent with federal equal employment opportunity laws. [...] “Bias in employment arising from the use of algorithms and AI falls squarely within the Commission’s priority to address systemic discrimination,” Burrows said. “While the technology may be evolving, anti-discrimination laws still apply. The EEOC will address workplace bias that violates federal civil rights laws regardless of the form it takes, and the agency is committed to helping employers understand how to benefit from these new technologies while also complying with employment laws.”\n\nAs part of the new initiative, the EEOC plans to:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Global executives and AI strategy for HR: How to tackle bias in algorithmic AI\n\nHuman resources staff interviewing a male job candidate in office\n\nThe move towards monitoring HR tools and applications for bias is gaining traction worldwide, driven by various global and domestic data privacy laws and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In line with this trend, the New York City Council has enacted new regulations requiring organizations to conduct yearly bias audits on automated employment decision-making tools used by HR departments. [...] The new rules, which passed in December 2021 with enforcement, will require organizations that use algorithmic HR tools to conduct a yearly bias audit. As per the new law, noncompliant organizations may face fines ranging from no less than USD 500 to no more than USD 1500 for each violation.\n\nTo prepare for this shift, some organizations are developing a yearly evaluation, mitigation, and review process. Here’s a suggestion for how that might work in practice.\n\n## Step one – Evaluate [...] Organizations should understand that this audit is not a one-time or isolated event. It’s not just about the regulations a single city or state is enacting. These laws are part of a continuing trend of governments stepping in to mitigate bias, establish ethical AI use, make sure private data stays private, and to reduce the harm done when data is mishandled. Therefore, organizations must budget for compliance costs and assemble a cross-discipline evaluation team to develop a regular audit process.\n\n## Author\n\nExecutive\n\nHR/Talent &amp; Data, Partner, IBM Consulting\n\nThis AI Academy guidebook covers how AI-augmented workforces allow employees to focus on higher-value work and create opportunities to deliver business value and new efficiencies.\n\n## Resources&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tutoring firm settles claim alleging its recruiting algorithm screened out applicants over 60 | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The commission has similarly warned employers that the tools could screen out workers with disabilities — not only because of algorithms but also due to inaccessibility. \n\nEmployers should conduct an ongoing self-analysis to determine whether they are using technology in a way that could result in discrimination, the agency’s chair, Charlotte A. Burrows, said in a May statement announcing a technical assistance document addressing potential bias in software, algorithms and AI employment tools. The guide cautioned employers that they may be liable for discrimination caused by such tools, even if they weren’t involved in the design. [...] In the settlement agreement, iTutorGroup denied the allegations and said it specifically disputes the claim that its tutors are employees covered by the ADEA. Instead, they were independent contractors, it said.\n\nThe agreement requires the company to post notice about the settlement, devise non-discrimination and complaint policies, train its managers, and submit reports to the EEOC, in addition to the monetary relief.\n\nEEOC cautions against bias in AI, algorithmic tools\n\nThe EEOC has in recent months cautioned employers about such screening tools.\n\nAs alleged in the iTutorGroup lawsuit, AI and algorithmic tools may perpetuate age and sex bias, stakeholders told the agency during a listening session last year; the same goes for race discrimination, they said.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;In EEOC settlement, job board agrees to use AI to look for bias | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Management-side attorneys recently applauded the commission’s effort to provide early guidance on the issue and said they’d appreciate even more. Regulation, however, could be a tougher sell. AI is improving the quality of hires, Emily Dickens, chief of staff, head of public affairs and corporate secretary for the Society for Human Resource Management, said during an EEOC event last year; “This is not the moment to impose heavy-handed regulatory restrictions that will set key HR functions back and impede the ability to create and identify talent pipelines.”\n\nMost recently, EEOC Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels said the commission’s goal is to ensure “we can enjoy the benefits of new technology while protecting the fundamental civil rights that are enshrined in our laws.” [...] DHI Group told HR Dive via email it disputes the claims but, “in a good faith effort to deter potentially discriminatory job postings by its customers, DHI and the EEOC were able to agree on reasonable terms to resolve this matter to avoid the substantial time and expense of protracted litigation.”\n\n### EEOC’s focus on AI\n\nThe EEOC has in recent years cautioned employers about potential pitfalls of AI use. \n\nEmployers using the tech should evaluate algorithms “early and often for biased outcomes and reengineer as appropriate,” Commissioner Keith Sonderling suggested in 2021. [...] The following year, EEOC and the U.S. Department of Justice together announced they were “sounding the alarm,” stating that “blind reliance” on tools that make use of AI, machine learning and other processes could lead to workplace discrimination.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EEOC hints at 2026 priorities with national origin bias guidance | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### What HR needs to know\n\nThe guidance informs workers that national origin bias can involve what EEOC calls discriminatory job postings, such as those that say “H-1B preferred” or “H-1B only,” harassment and retaliation.\n\nNational origin discrimination also can take the form of disparate treatment, such as “terminating American workers who are on the ‘bench’ between job assignments at a much higher rate than employees who are visa guest workers.” Disparate treatment also extends to hiring and compensation, workplace training, fringe benefits, and promotion or demotion, EEOC said. [...] Listen to the article\n4 min\n\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published a technical assistance document Wednesday laying out how anti-American bias — a form of national origin discrimination — can run afoul of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n\n“The EEOC is here to protect all workers from unlawful national origin discrimination — including American workers,” Chair Andrea Lucas said in a statement. “Unlawful bias against American workers, in violation of Title VII, is a large-scale problem in multiple industries nationwide.”\n\n“Discrimination Against American Workers Is Against The Law,” which was also published in Spanish, builds on previous guidance from President Donald Trump’s White House and could hint at EEOC’s 2026 agenda.\n\n### What HR needs to know [...] The document also warns against using common business reasons to “justify national origin discrimination,” such as customer or client preference, lower cost of labor or “beliefs that workers from one or more national origin groups are ‘more productive’ or possess a better work ethic than another national origin group.”\n\n“Nothing justifies illegal national origin discrimination — whether rooted in cost of labor, customer preferences, or stereotypes,” Lucas said in the EEOC statement.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Many companies are adopting the shift-left approach. Google Cloud points out that locating security issues in production can lead to significant financial penalties, such as GDPR fines of up to 4% of global revenue. Early detection through automated CI/CD security checks can greatly lower remediation costs and reduce the need for architectural changes. OpsMx notes challenges like implementation barriers, gaps in automation, complex tools, and organizational silos, while emphasizing that automated policy enforcement using frameworks like NIST and OWASP helps teams identify and prioritize risks without burdening developers. According to Splunk&#x27;s research, 73% of companies see a lack of automation as their main challenge in shift-left practices, but AI-driven tools are quickly improving [...] Save your spot.\n\nQCon London - image\n\nLearn what works in AI, architecture, data, security &amp; FinTech.\n\nEarly Bird ends Jan 13.\n\nQCon AI Boston - image\n\nLearn how leading engineering teams run AI in production—reliably, securely, and at scale.\n\nEarly Bird ends Jan 13.\n\nInfoQ Homepage\nNews\nCloudflare Scales Infrastructure as Code with Shift-Left Security Practices\n\n# Cloudflare Scales Infrastructure as Code with Shift-Left Security Practices\n\nJan 12, 2026\n3\nmin read\n\nby\n\nClaudio Masolo\n\n#### Write for InfoQ [...] #### Follow us on\n\n#### Stay in the know\n\nThe InfoQ Podcast Logo - Stay in the know\nEngineering Culture Podcast Logo - Stay in the knoww\nThe Software Architects&#x27; Newsletter Logo - Stay in the know\n\nInfoQ.com and all content copyright © 2006-2026 C4Media Inc.  \nPrivacy Notice, Terms And Conditions, Cookie Policy&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;3. Choosing a framework\n\nSelecting the right framework can increase the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management. Organizations can then evaluate which industry framework aligns best with their risk appetites and operational needs, such as the Cyber Risk Index (CRI), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and ISO standards. This may involve adopting a single framework or a combination of several to better integrate capabilities, operations and requirements across both technology risk and cyber risk. We typically advise a combination, given many of the shared objectives across risk, technology and security organizations. Once the framework is established and implemented, it can inform leading practices for defining standards, policies and risk assessments to drive action. [...] To preempt evolving threats, organizations can adopt a threat-led approach to risk management. This means integrating threat intelligence, security information and event management (SIEM) data, regulatory updates, and other relevant information into risk assessments, leveraging AI to continuously aggregate and correlate the data to define plausible top risk scenarios. Coupling generative AI-driven analytics to enhance predictive risk capabilities with agentic AI tvo enable proactive responses to current threats and anticipated future vulnerabilities further hardens an organization’s risk posture. Bridging the gap between traditional risk management and threat intelligence programs allows firms to proactively identify, assess and remediate risks in the context of organization-specific [...] EY Homepage\n\nEY helps clients create long-term value for all stakeholders.

The study encompassed 3,200 respondents across North America; Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).

[...] PLEASANTON, Calif., Jan. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday, Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY) today released new global research showing that while AI is delivering productivity gains, many organizations aren&#x27;t fully capturing its value. Employees are saving meaningful time with AI tools, but too often those gains are being absorbed by rework – fixing mistakes, rewriting content, and double-checking outputs from generic tools – leaving significant value on the table.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What are ambient agents? Why AI that acts will redefine ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Bhavin: It’s a real concern, but today’s agents mostly handle repetitive tasks. We give them guardrails and specific scopes. That frees up humans to work on more strategic issues. Some companies tried to replace entire systems with AI and had to reverse course due to poor outcomes.\n\nEliminating headcount is complicated. Good automation complements people, not replaces them. Keith: And it gives employees more fulfilling work. Like not having to constantly check OKRs or request progress updates from HR. Bhavin: Exactly. One customer had 800 people per month asking HR partners for goal progress updates. [...] It really comes down to whether the company is cloud-forward and already invested in automation. Keith: That makes sense. But I can hear IT folks asking: “Is this just another tool to bolt onto our existing stack?” How easy is integration? Bhavin: Ambient agents are challenging the current model.\n\nCopilots today mostly enhance the platform they live in — like Salesforce or Microsoft. But ambient agents work across systems — Slack, Workday, Jira, ServiceNow. That requires more expansive integration but delivers far more value. Fortunately, platforms are becoming more extensible, which helps. [...] But that’s a soft gain. Deep ROI happens when you transform processes. Take recruiting: Hiring managers constantly ask about open requisitions. With an agent monitoring applicant tracking systems, it can proactively provide updates. That saves time and reduces friction.\n\nShow more Show less\n\n15:00\n\nAmbient agents can also offer negative time to resolution — solving problems before they’re even raised. That changes everything. Keith: What about the fear that AI and agents are just there to replace jobs? Is that concern valid with ambient agents?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Powering up your people.\n\nWhen you have data everywhere, you have data nowhere. So, we made an early decision that all people data would be centralized in Workday.\n\nThis commitment simplified and personalized their experience in several ways. No more hunting for information across multiple systems—everything is in Workday. Additionally, the platform lets us focus on people’s skills, not just roles. Personalized career dashboards allow people to update information, highlight skills, explore opportunities, and connect with colleagues. As we transform our own workforce to work with gen AI and not be tethered to rigid jobs and roles, these insights are invaluable to accelerate our reinvention. [...] And with generative AI (gen AI), the opportunity is greater than ever. According to Accenture’s Work, Workforce, Workers research, 94% of people are ready to learn new skills to work with gen AI, yet only 5% of organizations are actively reskilling their workforce at scale. At a time when speed matters more than ever, Workday is a critical backbone enabling us to target, train and track the skills – from gen AI, to people leadership, to specialized industry skills – of all our people. [...] Resilient organizations are agile enough to continuously reinvent themselves in today’s shifting landscape, powered by their people. We know this because we have been on the journey ourselves, putting people at the center of our business strategy. We partnered with Workday to unleash our talent potential and prepare people for, not only a gen AI-enabled future, but for whatever is next on the horizon. Over the past four years, Workday has enabled us to continuously reinvent our business and talent models, unlock talent potential, innovate for our people, and make faster strategic decisions. Here’s how we did it:\n\n## Getting faster and bolder every day.&quot;,

Set across 180 acres of desert land, the hotel utilizes steel-frame modular units on commercially zoned property, aiming to meet visitor demand for accommodations while addressing community concerns about the impact of short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. Elsewhere, similar approaches are being taken: a recently opened eco-lodge near Grand Teton in Wyoming uses off-grid water and energy systems to minimize environmental disruption, while a small retreat in Vermont was converted from historic farm structures, integrating renewable energy and local materials to support the surrounding community. [...] ##### Tourism backlash\n\nWhen residents of Barcelona, Spain began spraying tourists with water guns, the images went viral. This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure. Wastewater from arriving cruise ships pollutes local ports. The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma [...] In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market.&quot;,

You messed around with fun tools, made some noise, and didn&#x27;t worry about being perfect. It was exciting, chaotic, and low-stakes.\n\nBut in 2026, the jam sessions are over.\n\nNow it’s time to get practical. The wild excitement around AI is being replaced by a focus on what actually works. The goal has shifted from exploring what AI can do to proving what it should do for your business. We are trading the thrill of jam sessions for the discipline of clear rules and real profits.&quot;,

The company’s mobility team had once spent about 100 hours coordinating with legal, HR, immigration, and compliance after an employee, requested temporary employment in a third country without residing or working there. The time and complexity of managing this unusual assignment highlighted the need to accelerate and streamline mobility processes, leading the business to adopt an AI-powered solution with advanced automation to improve efficiency. Automation is now breaking new ground in managing massive volumes of widely dispersed data across the organization’s 50-plus global sites. The company is now gaining unprecedented data insights and predictive analytics through four [...] At the same time, competition for talent remains fierce and businesses in many cases are scrambling for solutions that will quickly deliver the right capabilities in the right place. Some organizations are turning to support from new AI-driven talent-management platforms. Meanwhile, employees are challenging traditional approaches that require moves to new locations as they embrace new ways of working such as hybrid and fully remote work arrangements. [...] At the same time, the business is tapping into AI to implement workplace changes that optimize product and process design, supplier interactions, and overall business efficiency. AI is accelerating human resources processes, for example, as an HR workspace agent. Where employees previously submitted an IT support ticket for help and recommendations, AI now handles those requests, instantly providing support and recommendations. Turnaround time for support has been dramatically reduced. The organization provides mandatory AI training and remains careful to include human support, combining ‘bots and brains’ at all times as reliance on AI grows. It is also conducting an initiative to promote the use of AI and the business-wide sharing of AI agents that are advancing mobility’s self-service&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit shows the anticipated timeline for US employees&#x27; and business leaders’ use of gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily work tasks, presented as two stacked bar charts, one for C-suite respondents and one for employees. The segments are broken down into five categories representing different timeframes: Already using, less than a year, 1-5 years, over 5 years, and don&#x27;t anticipate it. A final category, not sure, is also included. A key finding highlighted in the chart is that employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the [...] employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don&#x27;t anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don&#x27;t anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure. Source: McKinsey US CxO survey, Oct–Nov 2024; McKinsey US employee survey, Oct–Nov 2024. This image description [...] The chart reveals that the 35-44 age group exhibits the most positive sentiment across most categories. For example, 90 percent of this group reports being comfortable using gen AI at work, the highest percentage among all age groups for this metric. This group also shows the highest percentage (62 percent) reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI. In contrast, the 55-64 and 65+ age groups consistently show lower percentages across all four metrics, with only 26 percent and 22 percent of employees in these age groups reporting extensive familiarity with gen AI respectively. The 18-24, 25-34, and 45-54 age groups show intermediate levels of positive sentiment, generally lower than the 35-44 group but higher than the 55-64 and 65+ age groups.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises. Some enterprise SaaS platforms with extended development capabilities include SAP, Salesforce, and Workday. Here’s a primer on the breadth of their development capabilities.\n\nDevelopers should also consider learning enterprise-ready low-code platforms that embrace AI, such as Appian, OutSystems, Pega, and Quickbase. [...] Developers must also explore how to use generative AI tools to write agile requirements, develop software, automate testing, maintain documentation, and drive other efficiencies across the software development life cycle (SDLC). Developer experiences are evolving from IDEs focused on writing code to natural language dialogs, code validation tools, and AI agents performing development tasks.\n\n“AI SDLC tools are just another new way for developers to use powerful assistants in their development pipelines, much like the modern IDE,” says Simon Margolis, associate CTO of AI and machine learning at SADA. “The developer’s core goal doesn’t change: applying logic to command tools, whether using English and Gemini CLI or writing Python directly.”\n\n## Diving into SaaS and low-code development&quot;,

[...] GenAI can assist code generation and review, helping to address skills shortages and improve alignment between implementations and stated requirements. It can help build granular knowledge bases, reduce manual data processing by reimagining workflows as human-agent collaboration, broaden ecosystems through open innovation in cloud and distributed computing, and elevate architecture and integration by exposing AI as services within and beyond the enterprise, including to regulators. Broader implications include greater personalisation, support for sustainability goals, and improved digital resilience (for example through alignment with the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) framework).\n\n## Illustrative example: Evolving account transfers with GenAI [...] This figure illustrates the four phases of enterprise GenAI adoption: (1) Experimentation, where organisations explore GenAI’s suitability for specific domains, processes, or use cases through proof-of-value initiatives like productivity improvement in SDLC activities; (2) Prepare, where enterprises use GenAI to prepare for modernisation by building knowledge repositories using legacy code bases and address challenges in modernisation. The Prepare phase includes AI for IT use cases like code documentation, test case generation, API enablement of legacy assets, etc, and AI for business use cases like chatbots, copilots for frontline workers.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All Posts\n\n# Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI\n\nMichael Nuñez\n\nSalesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company&#x27;s workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees. [...] Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot \&quot;an absolute &#x27;chaos tamer&#x27; for our team,\&quot; estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily \&quot;just by eliminating context switching.\&quot;\n\n## Slackbot vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Google Gemini: The fight for enterprise AI dominance\n\nThe launch puts Salesforce in direct competition with Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot, which is integrated into Teams and the broader Microsoft 365 suite, as well as Google&#x27;s Gemini integrations across Workspace. When asked what distinguishes Slackbot from these alternatives, Seaman pointed to context and convenience. [...] Madrigal said his security team signed off \&quot;rather quickly\&quot; — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. \&quot;Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they&#x27;re part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly.\&quot;\n\nOne Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving \&quot;at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day.\&quot; Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as \&quot;an assistant who&#x27;s paying attention when I&#x27;m not.\&quot;&quot;,

It had ambitious growth plans, intending to increase head count by at least 40% over three years.\n\nThe business gave mixed reviews about their satisfaction with the services HR was providing, especially citing a lack of closeness to the business reality. On the other side, HR was reporting to “run hot” with the amount of work and more than 100 ongoing projects.\n\n### Solution:\n\nUpon consultation with Mercer, PVH decided to re-imagine HR as a customer-centric people function that supports the business as a strategic partner and serves their business by: [...] ### Successful HR functions engage employees\n\nIt’s time for HR to shape the future of work by providing relevant advice and services that directly align with and support your organization’s business and people strategies. The right HR transformation drives the organizational strategy and people priorities, and it contributes to true business value. Our TIM approach grants the HR function greater responsibility than ever before, elevating the function to become a strategic advisor to business leaders.\n\nWith a TIM, HR can transform itself around employee experiences and evolve to a true people-centered function. TIM places a premium on delivering relevant services and exceptional interactions that yield measurable employee satisfaction, engagement and commitment.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale.\n\nIt’s critical that leaders meet this moment. It’s the only way to accelerate the probability that their companies will reach AI maturity. But they must move with alacrity, or they will fall behind.\n\nChapter 3\n\n## Delivering speed and safety [...] Imagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar “AI superagency”). This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide—and even make—decisions. That’s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will [...] The analysis extended far beyond surveys. The researchers also conducted interviews with dozens of C-level executives and industry experts to understand their perspectives on AI’s transformative potential and the steps they are taking to lead their organizations through this transition. The report was further enriched by discussions with experts at Stanford HAI, the Digital Economy Lab at HAI, and McKinsey’s leading AI experts. Our survey and research primarily focus on gen AI; however, it is important to note that participants in the survey may not have consistently differentiated between gen AI and other forms of AI.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unlocking the power of benefits data and AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Furthermore, automating routine tasks through AI — such as eligibility verification, claims processing, and reporting — reduces administrative burdens and minimizes errors. This not only improves efficiency but also frees HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives like employee engagement and benefits design.\n\nPredicting employee behavior and needs\n\nOne of AI’s most powerful applications is its ability to forecast employee needs. The employee benefits lifecycle is not a new concept but understanding it remains crucial. Employees’ needs evolve over time, from first job benefits to retirement planning. For example, younger employees may focus on student debt and early career development, while those in their 50s and 60s are more concerned with healthcare and retirement options. [...] Enrollment patterns, claims data, utilization rates and demographic details provide a comprehensive picture of employee preferences and behaviors. When analyzed effectively,  this data can inform strategic decisions that enhance employee experience and operational efficiency and point the way to cost savings. For example, if data indicates a rising interest in mental health resources, employers can expand relevant offerings, demonstrating responsiveness and care. Similarly, AI can reveal which benefits are underutilized and not providing value, helping employers optimize investments by negotiating better rates, eliminating redundant coverage, or streamlining plan options [...] Employer considerations\n\nMany employers are not yet leveraging AI in their total rewards processes. This gap presents a significant opportunity to harness AI’s potential to improve decision-making and employee experience. To maximize the power of your benefits data, consider the following:\n\nThe future of benefits management is data-driven and AI-enabled. Organizations that embrace AI will be better positioned to predict employee needs, personalize rewards, and operate more efficiently. This approach not only enhances employee satisfaction and retention but also drives cost savings through smarter resource allocation and process automation. Your journey begins with data readiness and a willingness to innovate.\n\nCoworkers standing up and looking at tablet together&quot;,

At a time when speed matters more than ever, Workday is a critical backbone enabling us to target, train and track the skills – from gen AI, to people leadership, to specialized industry skills – of all our people. [...] ## Powering up your people.\n\nWhen you have data everywhere, you have data nowhere.

No more hunting for information across multiple systems—everything is in Workday. Additionally, the platform lets us focus on people’s skills, not just roles. Personalized career dashboards allow people to update information, highlight skills, explore opportunities, and connect with colleagues. As we transform our own workforce to work with gen AI and not be tethered to rigid jobs and roles, these insights are invaluable to accelerate our reinvention.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While enhancing MRM across all three lines of defense is imperative, it is not easy. However, the advent of generative AI (GenAI) and AI agents offers an opportunity to improve MRM. These technologies can increase productivity by improving the efficacy of all the tasks and activities related with model risk management. They also help to reduce errors and strengthen compliance by automating routine tasks, augmenting human judgment, and enhancing transparency. In particular, AI agents enable proactive compliance through self-monitoring systems and continuously scanning for deviations, undocumented changes, and policy breaches before regulators scrutinize and identify these gaps.

The improved predictability of ROI must occur before AI can truly be scaled up by the enterprise.”\n\nIndeed, we still need way better AI, if a Workday survey this week is any indication: Some 85% of respondents said AI saved one to seven hours a week, but more than a third of the time savings is lost to correcting errors, rewriting and verifying content, and just 14% reported consistently positive outcomes from AI.

The speed gained through AI&#x27;s time savings \&quot;doesn&#x27;t always translate into better outcomes.\&quot; At least 85% of employees report saving one to seven hours per week using AI. However, the follow-up rework required washes out the savings -- to the tune of an average 1.5 weeks a year spent fixing AI outputs, the survey analysts estimate. Only 14% of employees consistently achieve net-positive outcomes from AI use, they add.\n\nAlso:Your colleagues are sick of your AI workslop [...] That&#x27;s the lesson being learned among employees and executives responding to a new survey by Workday. While AI is delivering productivity gains, those gains are being partially washed away when technologists or employees need to go back to implementations to fix mistakes, rewrite content, or double-check outputs. At least 37% of time savings gained through AI are lost to fixing low-quality output, according to the survey&#x27;s authors, which included the experiences of 3,200 practitioners.\n\n## The ultimate AI productivity paradox&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI&#x27;s war on busywork a creativity killer? What the experts ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;There&#x27;s a risk in assuming that every recovered minute should be filled with more high-intensity work,\&quot; she said. \&quot;If teams are constantly pushed from one cognitively demanding task to the next, creativity and strategic clarity actually suffer … AI should not turn the workday into a nonstop sprint, [but] rather create a better rhythm.\&quot;\n\nAn overreliance on AI tools in the workplace also raises the risk of creating a fractured, lonely workplace. [...] ## &#x27;AI should not turn the workday into a nonstop sprint&#x27;\n\nAnother central problem with the AI industry&#x27;s sales pitch is that even the most productive, disciplined workers can&#x27;t sustain intensely focused work indefinitely. We all have creative peaks and valleys over the course of a day; the trick is for each of us to get to know our own particular cognitive rhythms and learn to work with them.\n\nTo believe that we can simply offload busywork onto AI and perpetually focus on more cognitively demanding work is to misunderstand our own minds. [...] \&quot;I suspect that if we optimized entirely for highly cognitive work, we&#x27;d run into diminishing returns on quality,\&quot; said Shawn Spooner, global chief technology officer at advertising agency Billups. \&quot;A better paradigm would be to aim to keep our folks in flow state for a few multi-hour blocks each day, where they are the most productive and the most happy, stitched together with more mundane tasks to give their day a more natural ebb and flow.\&quot;\n\nAlso: 3 ways anyone can start using AI at work today - safely\n\nDebra Andrews, president of consulting firm Marketri, echoed that idea that the optimal workday is one that harmonizes hyper-focused productivity with relaxed downtime.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;It really comes down to whether the company is cloud-forward and already invested in automation. Keith: That makes sense. But I can hear IT folks asking: “Is this just another tool to bolt onto our existing stack?” How easy is integration? Bhavin: Ambient agents are challenging the current model.\n\nCopilots today mostly enhance the platform they live in — like Salesforce or Microsoft. But ambient agents work across systems — Slack, Workday, Jira, ServiceNow. That requires more expansive integration but delivers far more value. Fortunately, platforms are becoming more extensible, which helps.

Watch new episodes twice each week here or listen to the podcast. \n\nWhat are ambient agents? Why AI that acts will redefine automation at work [...] Keith: But that also raises privacy and security concerns. How do you manage trust and access? Bhavin: Privacy and autonomy are top of mind. Agents must respect the same enterprise rules already in place — no “god mode” access. You can’t have an agent guessing access permissions.\n\nAccess must be deterministic, based on roles, ACLs, and existing policies. Autonomy is earned over time. We advise starting with low-risk actions, like password resets. Only later should agents handle more sensitive tasks.\n\nKeith: And if trust is built, users are more willing to give up control — especially if the agent reassures them it can restore access quickly. Bhavin: Exactly. The key is reducing friction.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Johnson Electric Explores the Future of HR in the Era of Gen AI | Workday HK&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Boosting HR speed, precision, and intelligence.\n\n“Once Workday became our backbone of HR work globally, the next step was starting to use AI to make our lives easier,” says Moeller. For example, administrative HR tasks have been automated for years, but embedded AI now tells users when they make a mistake. Meanwhile Gen AI has taken over the task of creating job descriptions and postings, producing quality listings and adverts in seconds.\n\nAn advanced, AI-powered compensation module enables the team to automatically manage complex global requirements, from administering multiple bonus schemes to running diverse merit programs. The use of standardized rules gives Moeller confidence that employees are rewarded accurately and fairly, no matter where they are in the world. [...] Embedded AI suggests opportunities for improvement\n\nWhen Christian Moeller joined Johnson Electric as chief human resources officer, the company had been using Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) for three years. Moeller was there to see the system evolve to include AI tools. “It’s been a very fruitful partnership, full of mutual benefit,” Moeller notes. “Sometimes, we tell Workday what we need and Workday delivers. Sometimes Workday says, ‘Hey, we have this new functionality!’ and they show us how to use it.”\n\nJohnson Electric is already at the point where Workday is its only source of people data, integrated with finance and feeding all downstream systems. Now, under Moeller’s leadership, HR is exploring how the AI-powered Workday platform can enhance ways to work across the globe. [...] With generative AI capabilities embedded into its global HR platform, Johnson Electric is starting to accelerate work, drive continuous improvement, and uncover hidden talent in its 30,000-strong workforce.\n\nRecruitment ads and job descriptions written in seconds\n\nIntegrated people and finance data feed downstream systems\n\nEmbedded AI suggests opportunities for improvement&quot;,

The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group.

Lower percentages were observed for usage of gen AI being a requirement for a certification program (30 percent), explicit instructions from managers to use gen AI (30 percent), being involved in the development of the tools (29 percent), and OKRs/KPIs tied to gen AI usage (22 percent).&quot;,

It sounds productive—your AI writes a report in seconds!—but then your human employees have to spend hours fixing the errors. Workday thinks of this as the “AI Tax.”\n\nAccording to Workday research, nearly 40% of AI’s promised productivity is silently lost to rework.

In the current state, a credit or debit transfer request involves static validations like account checks and exception handling. In the future state, intelligent GenAI agents can enhance this process by dynamically leveraging external data, customer context, and market events. These agents can add contextual insights such as selecting the best account or currency, auto-handling exceptions (eg, fraud, AML, insufficient balance), and optimising transaction costs. This enables real-time decision-making, deeper personalisation, and more meaningful customer experience. Additionally, feedback from interactions (eg, sentiment analysis) and analytics (financial, customer goals [...] to build target applications in cloud.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Which development platforms and tools should you learn ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The biggest hurdle is not understanding the platform, and actually, the tool set in most platforms is pretty simple,” says Matt Grippo, SVP of core software at Workday. “The part that takes a little bit more knowledge is understanding the environment, the security model, and the business processes you have to work with.”\n\nWith LLMs and agentic AI capabilities being introduced by SaaS and low-code development platforms, developers may be considering whether learning them is a smart career path. [...] ## Diving into SaaS and low-code development\n\nSome developers have staked their careers on building skills and delivering results from enterprise SaaS platforms. On the other hand, some developers have focused on pro-code development and open source frameworks, leaving low-code and proprietary platforms aside.\n\nDevelopers should cast a wide net when learning to increase job opportunities and be open-minded about platforms, especially if they want to work in large enterprises.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit shows the anticipated timeline for US employees&#x27; and business leaders’ use of gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily work tasks, presented as two stacked bar charts, one for C-suite respondents and one for employees. The segments are broken down into five categories representing different timeframes: Already using, less than a year, 1-5 years, over 5 years, and don&#x27;t anticipate it. A final category, not sure, is also included. A key finding highlighted in the chart is that employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the [...] ### Beyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We wanted to quantify the economic value of the total amount of work that AI could assist with or automate today. To do that, we used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on the number of employees in each of the occupation groups in our study and then multiplied that by these employees’ median annual salaries. Then, using our exposure scores, we assessed the amount of this total economic value that could theoretically be exposed to AI.\n\nThe result—$4.5 trillion—is based on the assumption that the traditional way a task is completed would shift seamlessly to AI. Despite being theoretical, however, the calculation provides a glimpse into the sweeping economic change AI could bring.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;With ambient agents, those questions are handled automatically. HR professionals can focus on higher-value tasks. Keith: Some companies are training employees for more advanced work — level 3 or 4 support — because AI can now take over levels 0 and 1. Bhavin: That’s right.\n\nAmbient agents improve the quality of work and life. Studies show many AI initiatives don’t impact P&amp;L because companies overpromise on automation and underdeliver. The key is augmenting — not replacing — human effort.\n\nShow more Show less\n\n20:00\n\nKeith: Give me a concrete example from IT support. Can you share a real case where an ambient agent caught something before a help desk did? Bhavin: Sure. Let’s say there are 10 VPN disconnects in a region. An ambient agent detects the pattern and alerts IT. [...] It really comes down to whether the company is cloud-forward and already invested in automation. Keith: That makes sense. But I can hear IT folks asking: “Is this just another tool to bolt onto our existing stack?” How easy is integration? Bhavin: Ambient agents are challenging the current model.\n\nCopilots today mostly enhance the platform they live in — like Salesforce or Microsoft. But ambient agents work across systems — Slack, Workday, Jira, ServiceNow. That requires more expansive integration but delivers far more value. Fortunately, platforms are becoming more extensible, which helps. [...] Episode 355 What are ambient agents?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sydney Scott Editorial Strategist, AI Workday\n\nSydney Scott is an editorial strategist at Workday, developing thought leadership content with a focus on AI and emerging tech trends.  \n   \n Sydney has more than 10 years of experience in content strategy, social media marketing, and journalism. Prior to joining Workday, she developed content strategies for products across Meta and worked as a social strategist and journalist for places like the Tribeca Film Festival, ESSENCE, and BuzzFeed.  \n   \n She holds a bachelor’s degree in communications from Temple University.\n\nMore perspectives from Sydney\n\nThe Business Value of AI [...] Sydney Scott\n\nEditorial Strategist, AI\n\nWorkday\n\nIn this article\n\nJanuary 12, 2026   7 min read\n\n4. Link Copied\n\nRemember the early days of agentic AI? It felt like starting a garage band with your friends. You messed around with fun tools, made some noise, and didn&#x27;t worry about being perfect. It was exciting, chaotic, and low-stakes.\n\nBut in 2026, the jam sessions are over.\n\nNow it’s time to get practical. The wild excitement around AI is being replaced by a focus on what actually works. The goal has shifted from exploring what AI can do to proving what it should do for your business. We are trading the thrill of jam sessions for the discipline of clear rules and real profits. [...] ## 4. Fix the Feedback Loop (The \&quot;Workslop\&quot; Tax)\n\nLeaders are checking the receipts.\n\nAccording to Forrester, CEOs are expected to pull CFOs into more AI decisions this year, which might actually delay 25% of planned AI spending.\n\nWhy the hesitation? Because of a hidden cost called \&quot;workslop.”\n\nWorkslop is the messy, low-quality output that bad AI creates. It sounds productive—your AI writes a report in seconds!—but then your human employees have to spend hours fixing the errors. Workday thinks of this as the “AI Tax.”\n\nAccording to Workday research, nearly 40% of AI’s promised productivity is silently lost to rework. For every 10 hours of time you save using AI, your team pays back four hours just fixing the output.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;PLEASANTON, Calif., Jan. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday, Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY) today released new global research showing that while AI is delivering productivity gains, many organizations aren&#x27;t fully capturing its value. Employees are saving meaningful time with AI tools, but too often those gains are being absorbed by rework – fixing mistakes, rewriting content, and double-checking outputs from generic tools – leaving significant value on the table.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This trepidation translates into a more negative outlook on work. Employees scared by AI are more likely to dread starting their workday (56% vs. 23% of those not scared by AI). These findings suggest that AI-related anxiety can have far-reaching consequences for worker wellbeing and job satisfaction.\n\n32%\n\nof employees express concern about what AI will mean in the future\n\n28%\n\nof employees feel suspicious about the technology’s output\n\n17%\n\nof employees feel genuinely curious about the potential of AI [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations [...] The root of the fear: job securityAs an increasing number of workers find themselves expected to use AI in their daily work,  job loss anxiety has emerged as a critical emotional driver. While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Engineers should rely on AI to automate tedious tasks like healing broken tests automatically and generating boilerplate test cases.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unlocking the power of benefits data and AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Furthermore, automating routine tasks through AI — such as eligibility verification, claims processing, and reporting — reduces administrative burdens and minimizes errors. This not only improves efficiency but also frees HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives like employee engagement and benefits design.\n\nPredicting employee behavior and needs\n\nOne of AI’s most powerful applications is its ability to forecast employee needs. The employee benefits lifecycle is not a new concept but understanding it remains crucial. Employees’ needs evolve over time, from first job benefits to retirement planning. For example, younger employees may focus on student debt and early career development, while those in their 50s and 60s are more concerned with healthcare and retirement options. [...] Ensure data readiness: Build a solid foundation with accurate, comprehensive data on employee demographics, eligibility, job functions, and pay. High-quality data is essential for reliable AI insights.\n Enhance efficiency: Automation and AI solutions to streamline administration and improve the employee experience. For example, the administration system can “learn” from how an employee has answered decision-support questions and prefill responses when they going back into the system to review or make changes.\n Understand what you’re paying for: Leverage data science to analyze your benefits spend and utilization. This helps optimize costs while ensuring employees receive meaningful support. [...] Enrollment patterns, claims data, utilization rates and demographic details provide a comprehensive picture of employee preferences and behaviors. When analyzed effectively,  this data can inform strategic decisions that enhance employee experience and operational efficiency and point the way to cost savings. For example, if data indicates a rising interest in mental health resources, employers can expand relevant offerings, demonstrating responsiveness and care. Similarly, AI can reveal which benefits are underutilized and not providing value, helping employers optimize investments by negotiating better rates, eliminating redundant coverage, or streamlining plan options&quot;,

[...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Modern real-time datasets offer granular segmentation by detailed job titles, job families, experience levels, and U.S. metropolitan areas or broader regional clusters. Advanced platforms like SalaryCube’s Bigfoot Live provide daily-updated benchmarks with transparent methodology documentation and sample size disclosure, ensuring HR teams can evaluate data quality and make defendable decisions. The ability to price hybrid or emerging roles through AI-assisted job matching addresses the growing challenge of compensation benchmarking for positions that don’t fit traditional survey categories.\n\nInternal HRIS and Payroll Data\n\nInternal HRIS and payroll data must flow automatically into planning workflows rather than requiring manual uploads each cycle.

Workday unifies HR and Finance on one intelligent platform with AI at the core to empower people at every level with the clarity, confidence, and insights they need to adapt quickly, make better decisions, and deliver outcomes that matter.

[...] PLEASANTON, Calif., Jan. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday, Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY) today released new global research showing that while AI is delivering productivity gains, many organizations aren&#x27;t fully capturing its value. Employees are saving meaningful time with AI tools, but too often those gains are being absorbed by rework – fixing mistakes, rewriting content, and double-checking outputs from generic tools – leaving significant value on the table. [...] \&quot;Too many AI tools push the hard questions of trust, accuracy, and repeatability back onto individual users,\&quot; said Gerrit Kazmaier, president, product and technology, Workday. \&quot;At Workday, we&#x27;ve spent years delivering AI as simple, human‑centered solutions – not raw technology – so customers aren&#x27;t left to wire things together and fact‑check every answer on their own. Our philosophy is that AI should do the complex work under the hood so people can focus on judgment, creativity, and connection. That&#x27;s how organizations turn AI‑powered speed into durable, human‑led advantage.\&quot;\n\nThe AI Productivity Paradox&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Engineers should rely on AI to automate tedious tasks like healing broken tests automatically and generating boilerplate test cases. But humans should remain in charge of which tests are executed and how to react to complex test failures.\n\nRohit Raghuvansi \n\nJan 13, 2026\n\nArtificial intelligence technologies\n\n Real-time Analytics News for the Week Ending January 10 \n\nIn this week’s real-time analytics news: NVIDIA launched its new NVIDIA Rubin platform that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nSalvatore Salamone \n\nJan 10, 2026\n\nArtificial intelligence technologies\n\n Model-as-a-Service Part 1: The Basics [...] Featured Resources\n\n  Link to Best Practices for Deploying and Scaling Industrial AI \n\n  Best Practices for Deploying and Scaling Industrial AI\n\n  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industrial operations, helping organizations optimize workflows, reduce downtime, and enhance productivity.

This brings transparency, but also volatility: costs rise based on workload design, prompt length, and hidden choices of infrastructure providers.

However, a multimodal reasoning agent today could notice a damp patch on a wall, infer a leaking joint, draft a repair plan and even generate an invoice or parts list. The plumber still fixes the pipe, but the inspection, diagnosis and supportive actions that lead up to or follow it can increasingly be assisted by AI.  \n   \n Reasoning and perception are beginning to overlap in almost any role that needs situational judgment. Retail store planning, vehicle servicing and energy infrastructure maintenance all rely on visual understanding and procedural thinking. The compounding effect helps the coordination, diagnosis and verification that connects thought with action.&quot;,

So, we made an early decision that all people data would be centralized in Workday.\n\nThis commitment simplified and personalized their experience in several ways. No more hunting for information across multiple systems—everything is in Workday. Additionally, the platform lets us focus on people’s skills, not just roles. Personalized career dashboards allow people to update information, highlight skills, explore opportunities, and connect with colleagues. As we transform our own workforce to work with gen AI and not be tethered to rigid jobs and roles, these insights are invaluable to accelerate our reinvention. [...] Resilient organizations are agile enough to continuously reinvent themselves in today’s shifting landscape, powered by their people. We know this because we have been on the journey ourselves, putting people at the center of our business strategy. We partnered with Workday to unleash our talent potential and prepare people for, not only a gen AI-enabled future, but for whatever is next on the horizon. Over the past four years, Workday has enabled us to continuously reinvent our business and talent models, unlock talent potential, innovate for our people, and make faster strategic decisions. Here’s how we did it:\n\n## Getting faster and bolder every day.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 ways to stop cleaning up after AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s the lesson being learned among employees and executives responding to a new survey by Workday. While AI is delivering productivity gains, those gains are being partially washed away when technologists or employees need to go back to implementations to fix mistakes, rewrite content, or double-check outputs. At least 37% of time savings gained through AI are lost to fixing low-quality output, according to the survey&#x27;s authors, which included the experiences of 3,200 practitioners.\n\n## The ultimate AI productivity paradox [...] It&#x27;s the ultimate AI productivity paradox, the Workday authors argue. The speed gained through AI&#x27;s time savings \&quot;doesn&#x27;t always translate into better outcomes.\&quot; At least 85% of employees report saving one to seven hours per week using AI. However, the follow-up rework required washes out the savings -- to the tune of an average 1.5 weeks a year spent fixing AI outputs, the survey analysts estimate. Only 14% of employees consistently achieve net-positive outcomes from AI use, they add.\n\nAlso:Your colleagues are sick of your AI workslop [...] Also:Worried AI will take your remote job? You&#x27;re safe for now, this study shows\n\nThe organizations realizing the greatest value from AI \&quot;treat saved time as a strategic resource,\&quot; the Workday team states. \&quot;They reinvest in upskilling their teams, improving collaboration, and strengthening judgment-driven work. The biggest opportunity is helping employees learn how to use AI effectively -- especially in areas that require judgment, creativity, and decision-making.\&quot;\n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\nI tried Gemini&#x27;s &#x27;scheduled actions&#x27; to automate my AI - the potential is enormous (but Google has work to do)\&quot;)\n\nHow to remove Copilot AI from Windows 11 today\n\nIs AI coming for your job?

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI&#x27;s war on busywork a creativity killer? What the experts ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;There&#x27;s a risk in assuming that every recovered minute should be filled with more high-intensity work,\&quot; she said. \&quot;If teams are constantly pushed from one cognitively demanding task to the next, creativity and strategic clarity actually suffer … AI should not turn the workday into a nonstop sprint, [but] rather create a better rhythm.\&quot;\n\nAn overreliance on AI tools in the workplace also raises the risk of creating a fractured, lonely workplace. [...] ## &#x27;AI should not turn the workday into a nonstop sprint&#x27;\n\nAnother central problem with the AI industry&#x27;s sales pitch is that even the most productive, disciplined workers can&#x27;t sustain intensely focused work indefinitely. We all have creative peaks and valleys over the course of a day; the trick is for each of us to get to know our own particular cognitive rhythms and learn to work with them.\n\nTo believe that we can simply offload busywork onto AI and perpetually focus on more cognitively demanding work is to misunderstand our own minds. [...] \&quot;I suspect that if we optimized entirely for highly cognitive work, we&#x27;d run into diminishing returns on quality,\&quot; said Shawn Spooner, global chief technology officer at advertising agency Billups. \&quot;A better paradigm would be to aim to keep our folks in flow state for a few multi-hour blocks each day, where they are the most productive and the most happy, stitched together with more mundane tasks to give their day a more natural ebb and flow.\&quot;\n\nAlso: 3 ways anyone can start using AI at work today - safely\n\nDebra Andrews, president of consulting firm Marketri, echoed that idea that the optimal workday is one that harmonizes hyper-focused productivity with relaxed downtime.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Home &gt; Featured Blogs &gt; The Forrester Wave™: Intranet Platforms, Q2 2024 Is Now Live! # The Forrester Wave™: Intranet Platforms, Q2 2024 Is Now Live! The Forrester Wave™: Intranet Platforms, Q2 2024 published on June 6. Automation, AI (particularly generative AI), and data-driven analytics have been major areas of investments for many of the vendors in this evaluation. Here are key findings from this Forrester Wave:. * **Generative AI is shaping vendors’ roadmaps, but adoption by users is in early days.** Writing assistants, automated translations, content transformations, and intelligent agents/bots have all entered the intranet and employee communications landscape. Common examples include end-to-end content and communication delivery flows, such as for new hire onboarding (i.e., automatically deliver tasks and educational information over a new worker’s first 90 days), and multistep campaigns and calendars to help coordinate streams of communication, including reports and/or AI to help optimize delivery times, days, or channels. * **Reporting and dashboards show big improvements.** Vendors have made important investments here with an eye to giving intranet program leaders and communication pros the data to truly understand how users engage with content. Digital workplace leaders looking to build a shortlist and estimate a budget will need to do more upfront research to understand their requirements and know their workforce (e.g., number of desk workers vs. I’ll be hosting a webinar for Forrester clients about The Forrester Wave: Intranet Platforms, Q2 2024 on July 16 at 11:00 a.m. ET. And, as always, I’d love to talk more about your intranet, employee communications, and digital workplace needs. ###### Related Forrester Content. * The Forrester Wave: Intranet Platforms Q2 2024. #### Forrester’s B2B Summits connect you with analysts and insights to help you navigate buying shifts, win with AI, accelerate growth, and transform revenue. At Tanium Converge 2025 in Orlando, Florida, Tanium CEO Dan Streetman kicked things off by highlighting Tanium’s strategy shift — extending beyond managing and securing endpoints to delivering autonomous IT platform solutions. For years, organizations have poured money into collaboration tools, intranets, devices, workflow platforms, and automation — all under the banner of “improving the digital employee experience.” Yet employee frustration with digital friction remains.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Key Takeaways From The Forrester Wave™: Data Management For Analytics Platforms, Q2 2025&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Key Takeaways From The Forrester Wave™: Data Management For Analytics Platforms, Q2 2025. # Key Takeaways From The Forrester Wave™: Data Management For Analytics Platforms, Q2 2025. I’m excited to announce the release of **The Forrester Wave™: Data Management For Analytics Platforms, Q2 2025**. This edition evaluated the 11 most significant data management and analytics (DMA) platform vendors, providing a comprehensive view of a market undergoing rapid transformation. Over the past decade, we’ve consistently published the DMA Wave, tracking the evolution of the space and offering guidance to enterprises navigating their data strategy, but this year’s evaluation reflects a notable shift. This year’s Wave captures how vendors are adapting with new and advanced capabilities fueled by advanced automation, integrated data intelligence, and AI-driven data management. Generative AI is emerging as a transformative force, enhancing both automation and intelligence within DMA. As a result, selecting the right DMA platform provider to support immediate and long-term data strategies has become increasingly complex. * **Generative AI is automating DMA functions.** The modern DMA platform is automating complex tasks such as data ingestion, cleansing, transformation, integration, governance, and security. Natural language allows users to interact with data, generate insights, and manage platforms without deep technical expertise. Leading vendors leverage agentic AI and natural language capabilities to deliver more intelligent and integrated data management. * **Built-in data intelligence is elevating DMA to a new level.** Built-in data intelligence is streamlining data semantic-related tasks, dramatically improving efficiency and unlocking deeper insights. With generative AI and data intelligence becoming foundational to modern DMA platforms, vendors increasingly embed these capabilities — although vendor offerings range from basic to highly advanced, integrated solutions. This holistic approach ensures that our evaluation reflects the rising demand for intelligent, intuitive, and highly automated data management solutions. If your organization still relies on traditional data management tools for analytical workloads, now is the time to shift to a modern DMA platform. Modern platforms powered by genAI, advanced automation, and intelligence enable the real-time delivery of consistent and trusted data. Upgrading your DMA platform isn’t just a technology upgrade; it’s a strategic move toward becoming a data-driven, AI-enabled organization.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Three Key Findings From The Forrester Wave™: Revenue Enablement Platforms, Q3 2024&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;2. AI is already integrated throughout enablement platforms. Vendors are using AI to streamline and improve enablement on multiple fronts: generative AI to create and optimize content and learning pathways, AI-guided pitch practice for sellers, AI-based pitch scoring, AI dubbing and transcription to engage multilingual audiences, and AI creation of quizzes and learning checkpoints. Vendors will continue innovating with AI in pursuit of better productivity and learning, but it remains to be seen how popular the innovation will be with customers. [...] ### What’s Next?\n\nVendors are continuing along this new path of innovating in a combined readiness-content environment, and their development roadmaps promise exciting new capabilities. Their success hinges on their customers’ appetite to digest the changes as quickly as vendors deliver innovation. We expect big advances in generative AI, integrated content and readiness functionality, and more insightful reporting about the intersection of content, learning, and real-world results.\n\n###### Related Forrester Content\n\n The Forrester Wave™: Revenue Enablement Platforms, Q3 2024\n The Forrester Wave™: Sales Readiness Solutions, Q4 2023\n The Forrester Wave™: Sales Content Solutions, Q4 2022\n\n###### Categories\n\n B2B Sales\n Sales Enablement\n vendor selection [...] To evaluate the revenue enablement platform vendors, we used three primary sources: responses to a detailed questionnaire, a live product demo, and an in-depth survey of the vendors’ reference customers.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Highlights From The Forrester Wave™: Content Platforms, Q1 2025&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The pace of innovation over the last two years has been unprecedented — driven by AI. Generative AI (genAI), is transforming how we create, consume, and govern content. Vendors are making substantial investments in genAI, with capabilities evolving quickly as large language models and agentic AI continue to develop. This rapid iteration means that businesses can expect continuous improvement, including evolving pricing models to put more AI capabilities into users’ hands. [...] Interested in learning more?

Watch Forrester’s Take On 2026 Scenario Planning [...] Context matters when trying to get value out of genAI. Bring AI to your content rather than bringing your content to AI. Using the embedded genAI capabilities from your content platform vendor can provide an unfair advantage. Most evaluated vendors are using a retrieval-augmented generation architecture that shields your corporate content from public AI models, and also respects existing access controls and permission structures. Exposing a genAI assistant in a folder, a workspace, or search result interface can ground the AI in the that specific context — i.e., a customer case, a project folder, or list of incoming claims — to return specific answers and relevant citation links to source documents.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Have a strategy for harnessing generative AI. Look for more than a simple “generate content” button. Practically overnight, nearly all vendors released those. Look for providers that offer a credible vision (and incremental releases) of reimagined interactions such as a big fat prompt box on your home page for customers to start conversing, messaging conversations with rich media and links, or marketplaces that propose a bill of materials with assembly instructions. [...] Step 3: Imagine how a new entrant might replicate these testimonials and growth as a result.\n\nThe (new) supply is ahead of demand.\n\nWelcome to what my colleague Ted Schadler calls “the intelligent century.”\n\nGenerative AI (genAI) is widely believed to be more significant than the steam engine. The ripple effects will be vast — will be.\n\nThe vendors in this evaluation have added, and are continuing to add, lots of genAI (which hasn’t been deployed en masse by their clients yet).\n\nAs you make your shortlist of strategic vendors with a portfolio of applications, look for those that: [...] Orient around continuous optimization. You don’t know what your customers will respond to, nor what will be the most actionable cohorts for a particular campaign or product line. Experience experimentation capabilities enable you to find out. Leading vendors use content created by generative AI and propensity models that conclude what is most likely to drive engagement.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Home &gt; Featured Blogs &gt; Key Takeaways From The Forrester Wave™: Business Intelligence Platforms, Q2 2025. # Key Takeaways From The Forrester Wave™: Business Intelligence Platforms, Q2 2025. Forrester recently published our latest evaluation of business intelligence (BI) platform offerings: The Forrester Wave™: Business Intelligence Platforms, Q2 2025. 2. **GenAI is not the end of BI.** Generative AI (genAI) is not replacing business intelligence; instead, it’s leveling the playing field as all BI vendors integrate generative and agentic AI capabilities based on the same large language models (LLMs). Every BI vendor is now making a claim that their platform is genAI- and agentic AI-based. But *how* BI vendors are leveraging the power of genAI is what makes the difference. This means that data, analytics, and AI leaders must be very clear on how each BI vendor is delivering genAI-based functionality embedded in the BI platform. * **GenAI functionality.** What specific BI platform functionality is based on genAI (natural language query [NLQ], natural language generation [NLG], enriching semantic layer, etc.)? Does the platform offer any non-core BI, genAI-based functionality such as mining unstructured data, documenting data sets/populating a data catalog, or others? * **GenAI architecture.** What specific foundation LLM APIs and/or BI vendor proprietary language models are provided out of the box? * **GenAI domain specialization.** Does the platform come with industry-/business domain-specific language models? * **GenAI for enterprise data.** How does the platform’s genAI functionality get access to enterprise data, metadata, and other contexts? * **GenAI guardrails.** What are the guardrails the platform uses to ensure that users only have access to LLM results they are allowed to see? For the detailed results, including all eight genAI criteria, 19 other criteria around vendors’ current offerings, and six vendor strategy criteria, please read The Forrester Wave™: Business Intelligence Platforms, Q2 2025, and/or set up a call with me. The choice of agentic AI technology for enterprise leaders is best understood as an ecosystem of tech vendors that align with three functional planes, based on the need to: 1) build agents; 2) embed them into business workflows; and 3) manage and govern them at scale.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Home &gt; Featured Blogs &gt; Announcing The Forrester Wave™: Governance, Risk, And Compliance Platforms, Q4 2023. # Announcing The Forrester Wave™: Governance, Risk, And Compliance Platforms, Q4 2023. The Forrester Wave™: Governance, Risk, And Compliance Platforms, Q4 2023, is now live! When Odysseus left Ithaca and sailed to fight in the Trojan War, he had no idea how the gods would impact his journey — or that it would take him over 20 years to return home. Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) has endured its own 20-year odyssey (but with much less hubris and divine anger). Over time, regulators, companies, and investors learned better practices and began expanding GRC principles broadly across business disciplines — with plenty of setbacks and confusion along the way. Now, with innovations in AI, risk intelligence data, and advanced GRC platform capabilities, the vision of holistic GRC is becoming more attainable and practical for firms of all sizes. Since our last Forrester Wave™ evaluation, three key trends have emerged in the GRC odyssey:. 1. **De-risking risk management.** Changes to workflow, visualizations, and GRC analyst experience improve how platforms reduce friction and scale. 2. **Reimagining GRC processes with artificial intelligence.** The GRC market has talked about machine learning and AI for over a decade, but it was relegated to workflow automations and data integrations. With generative AI’s rise, GRC platforms are rapidly embracing AI for content creation, behavior/event prediction, and knowledge articulation across GRC use cases. We are only at the beginning of seeing how AI will reimagine GRC. 3. **Demonstrating a holistic approach to GRC.** Companies can’t afford to implicitly govern their business and need an effective platform that works with their technology stacks to communicate vertically and horizontally within an enterprise. Leading vendors are showcasing clear views of platform technical depth and breadth that address GRC as a complete program rather than a discrete technology. Whether you are already using a GRC platform or embarking on your first experience, read this report for more insight on the GRC market and the 15 vendors that matter most. * GRC - Governance, Risk, And Compliance.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The use cases section focuses on gen AI deployments that provide productivity boosts through automation of specific tasks or jobs. Examples include conducting smarter searches for everyday information (personal), planning events (personal), assessing candidate recruiting performance (business), accelerating contract generation (business), processing customer information faster (business), and identifying high-value consumers for tailored sales actions (business). These gen AI examples are all positioned on the more localized end of the impact spectrum. [...] The domains section shows gen AI applications that reshape multiple roles across an area of operations. These are all classified as having a primary business impact and include developing and executing data-based campaigns, conducting synthetic customer research, conducting real-time supply chain monitoring, and accelerating coding processes. These use cases fall in the middle of the spectrum between more localized and more universal impact levels. [...] These AI-specific headwinds are formidable but addressable. Companies are pushing ahead. For example, they might use dynamic cost planning or look at procuring NVIDIA clusters to secure the infrastructure they expect to need.18“AWS and NVIDIA announce strategic collaboration to offer new supercomputing infrastructure, software and services for generative AI,” NVIDIA, press release, November 28, 2023. Chief HR officers (CHROs) are developing training programs to upskill their current workforces and support some employees in job transitions.

On this episode of Stock Movers: - Deere (DE) shares are under pressure after the company put out a weak forecast, and investors are reacting negatively. The farm equipment maker is struggling because tariffs have hurt demand for crops, which means farmers have less money to spend on new machinery. (HPQ) stock is down after reporting outlook below expectations yesterday. HP blamed the high cost of memory chips that go into computers. HP, which makes computers and printers, also said it will cut 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next two years and replace them with AI tools. - Workday (WDAY) results beat estimates, but there are questions from analysts about how much of that is from an acquisition it made in October, and how much is organic growth. Bloomberg Intelligence pointed out that large companies are cutting workers, so it&#x27;ll be hard for Workday to take on new clients. Help©2026 Bloomberg L.P. All Rights Reserved.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What are ambient agents? Why AI that acts will redefine ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;It really comes down to whether the company is cloud-forward and already invested in automation. Keith: That makes sense. But I can hear IT folks asking: “Is this just another tool to bolt onto our existing stack?” How easy is integration? Bhavin: Ambient agents are challenging the current model.\n\nCopilots today mostly enhance the platform they live in — like Salesforce or Microsoft. But ambient agents work across systems — Slack, Workday, Jira, ServiceNow. That requires more expansive integration but delivers far more value.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Jared Cameron, Principal Digital HR and Technology, Mercer New Zealand, said that in just 12 months, generative AI has become part of everyday work for many organisations and highlighted that the use cases for AI in HR go well beyond efficiency gains from writing job descriptions. As we dial up the complexity of what AI can do, he sees potential for more personalised learning and better insights into employee experience. But to leverage AI companies will need a strong foundation with data on talent skills, careers and job architecture.\n 44:49 - The audience makes their bet\n 50:40 - Questions from the audience\n\n### \n\nResources [...] Opportunities and challenges for HR in the age on generative AI: Nearly 75% of surveyed companies by the World Economic Forum are expected to adopt generative AI. Mercer&#x27;s global Talent Trend study also highlights that executives&#x27; top priorities include redesigning work for agility which will require them to re-design their HR function.\n Human-centric approach: David emphasises the importance of being \&quot;digital\&quot; rather than just \&quot;doing digital.\&quot; HR should focus on understanding the needs of employees and aligning technology to enhance their experience and productivity. [...] ### \n\n “You can&#x27;t just do digital, you can&#x27;t just have technology be an adjunct to what we do, we shouldn&#x27;t throw it over the fence to our IT folks, we should really own it and understand how we can use the technology to drive and help us be a great strategic function that HR could and should be.”\n\n  - David Guazzarotto, Leader for Digital HR and Technology Advisory practice, Mercer Pacific\n \&quot;80% of projects in the HR Tech space fail. We need to get better at that. And the only way we&#x27;re going to do that is to stop pushing the technology at everything. I think the opportunity for us and what I like personally working with clients is to help them really understand what is their strategic agenda?\&quot;&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;PwC deploys Microsoft Copilot at enterprise scale&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;During the month of October 2025, PwC employees executed over 8.7 million actions in Copilot, freeing up over 500,000 hours of capacity in the process. With 54% of PwC’s global workforce using AI tools weekly, employees average nine prompts per week.\n\nThe impact extends beyond productivity. AI agents now help research teams extract data from complex files in seconds, freeing PwC employees to focus on higher-value insights. Citizen developers are creating low-code applications that further automate and improve processes.\n\nRole-based training helps employees understand how to use agents effectively, spot AI hallucinations, and apply Responsible AI principles in their daily work. Regular playbooks, live demos, and “prompt-of-the-day” campaigns continue to drive engagement. [...] Microsoft’s enterprise-grade architecture has been central to success—offering strong encryption, secure data storage, and region-specific compliance controls. Local data stays local, enabling confidence across our territories.\n\nToday, Copilot isn’t just an assistant. It’s an integrated AI framework that powers smarter, faster, and more trusted work—for PwC and for our clients.\n\nGet more on this topic\n\nEbook: Elevate your AI transformation with PwC and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365\n\nPwC and Microsoft deliver award-winning transformation\n\n“It’s important we have conviction that the technology works in order to build industrial strength solutions with it.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Packaged AI solutions (e.g., Agentforce, ServiceNow Copilot, Workday AI) abstract tokens entirely. Leaders see a predictable subscription or per-seat fee, but little transparency into token consumption efficiency. The risk is overpaying for simplicity.\n API and model consumption (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Together AI) make tokens explicit. Every query is metered, billed and exposed. This brings transparency, but also volatility: costs rise based on workload design, prompt length, and hidden choices of infrastructure providers. AI costs go up due to a token meter running in real time.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Redefining work: Around 60% of current jobs didn&#x27;t exist in the 1940s, showcasing the need for reskilling and adaptation to new roles. HR&#x27;s role is to lead organisations through this change and identify critical future skills for the digital age.\n Transformation challenges: Around 80% of HR tech projects fail to achieve intended ROI or solve business problems. David emphasises that organisations should focus on problem-solving rather than adopting technology for its own sake.\n Strategic intent: David&#x27;s recommendations for organisations include starting with a people-centric approach, embracing digital transformation as a cultural shift, and taking intentional steps toward technology adoption aligned with the organisation&#x27;s strategic agenda. [...] Jared Cameron, Principal Digital HR and Technology, Mercer New Zealand, said that in just 12 months, generative AI has become part of everyday work for many organisations and highlighted that the use cases for AI in HR go well beyond efficiency gains from writing job descriptions. As we dial up the complexity of what AI can do, he sees potential for more personalised learning and better insights into employee experience. But to leverage AI companies will need a strong foundation with data on talent skills, careers and job architecture.\n 44:49 - The audience makes their bet\n 50:40 - Questions from the audience\n\n### \n\nResources [...] Insights for HR leaders in this episode\n\n Importance of skills in the future of work and benefits of skills-powered model\n Key challenges and considerations when implementing a skills-powered approach, such as ensuring privacy and data protection, integrating with existing technology and effectively managing change\n Importance of collaboration between the organisation, technology partners and change management\n Conditions for a successful journey, including strong leadership support and stakeholder engagement\n Test and learn phases and the need for flexibility and continuous adaptation\n Effective strategies for driving change and facilitating communication throughout the transformation process\n Practical suggestions for organisations considering a similar transition.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Discovery Phase\n\nThe discovery phase involves auditing current systems, data quality, and process documentation to identify integration requirements and potential challenges.  HR teams should inventory their existing technology stack—HRIS, payroll, performance management, equity administration, and ATS platforms—along with current data flows and manual processes. Reviewing compensation philosophy documentation, job architecture consistency, and range-setting procedures helps identify areas where platform capabilities can immediately add value versus areas requiring process redesign. [...] Training should be role-specific and workflow-focused: managers need to understand how to access employee data, interpret market positioning, and enter recommendations within budget guidelines, while HR teams require broader platform knowledge for configuration, reporting, and analytical capabilities. Finance stakeholders need visibility into budget tracking, scenario modeling, and cost projection features.\n\nPost-Implementation Success Metrics&quot;,
