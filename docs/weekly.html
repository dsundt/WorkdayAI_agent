<ul>
<li><strong>Workday Introduces New Custom AI Model Library to Power Smarter, Faster Contract Reviews (2025-10-22):</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>Workday’s release of a customizable AI model library brings enterprise-grade, domain-tailored AI for HR and finance contracts. This advances modular agentic AI within the Workday stack and enhances both operational efficiency and risk controls for Deloitte clients. Deloitte can use this as a foundation for managed service offerings leveraging Workday’s secure AI tooling, promoting ROI through process speed and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>LangChain Raises $125M to Accelerate AI Agent Tooling (2025-10-20):</strong> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/20/ai-agent-tooling-provider-langchain-raises-125m-1-25b-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>LangChain’s blockbuster funding is rapidly growing the ecosystem of open, composable agentic AI stacks. This surge leads to more customizable—but potentially fragmented—AI environments for SaaS, requiring more sophisticated cross-platform integration and governance. Deloitte must advance its capabilities in selecting, integrating, and governing disparate agentic frameworks both inside and outside core HCM platforms.</li>
<li><strong>IBM and Groq Partner to Accelerate Enterprise AI Deployment (2025-10-20):</strong> <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510200600CANADANWCANADAPR_C2431-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>By combining IBM’s enterprise AI toolchains with Groq’s hardware acceleration, this partnership targets performance and security requirements for agentic AI in regulated industries. It raises the competitive bar for Workday and ecosystem players, and gives Deloitte more levers to help clients benchmark and select fit-for-purpose infrastructures for next-gen SaaS and AI workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Leena AI Opens 'AI Colleague Studio' for Enterprise Agent Customization (2025-10-22):</strong> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/22/leena-opens-ai-colleague-studio-enterprise-agent-customization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>Leena AI’s extensible agent studio illustrates the competitive boom in customizable, plug-and-play agent environments spanning HR, finance, and operations. Deloitte must solidify its leadership in safe integration and orchestration of both core Workday agents and those from third-party vendors, ensuring compliance while enhancing end-user experience.</li>
<li><strong>KPMG Launches Global Business Services with Velocity for Agentic AI Transformations (2025-10-22):</strong> <a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/10/kpmg-launches-global-business-services-with-kpmg-velocity-enabled-by-servicenow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>KPMG’s managed services strategy—rooted in modular agentic AI—raises the bar for GSIs and SaaS providers. Deloitte can respond by accelerating its own agentic managed services, leveraging both Workday and ecosystem partner innovation.</li>
<li><strong>UnifyApps Raises $50M, Appoints New Co-CEO to Build AI Operating System (2025-10-22):</strong> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/22/ai-operating-system-startup-unifyapps-raises-50m-gets-new-co-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>UnifyApps’ trajectory reveals expanding interest in agentic OS platforms capable of unifying enterprise apps, data, and agents. Workday and Deloitte must track and inform clients about the best paths to leverage or integrate such platforms with their enterprise SaaS and AI investments.</li>
<li><strong>Workday AI Agents: Momentum in APAC and AI Workforce Boundaries (2025-10-23):</strong> <a href="https://en-sg.newsroom.workday.com/ai-agents-are-gaining-momentum-in-singapore-but-employees-want-clear-boundaries-workday-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>Strong APAC demand for agentic AI is tempered by employee concerns over transparency and trust. Leading change management and policy design for AI workforce transitions—founded in data from Workday’s regional research—should be a Deloitte priority.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>The week of October 18–25, 2025 marked a sharp escalation in the depth, customization, and competition of agentic AI within the SaaS ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workday’s new custom AI model library and the APAC AI agent study highlight both the technical and human adoption dimensions for next-gen enterprise AI.</li>
<li>Competitive activity intensified: SAP, Oracle, and UKG all launched or upgraded agentic capabilities, further blurring lines between workflow automation, AI assistance, and cross-platform orchestration.</li>
<li>Independent and startup activity—including LangChain, Leena AI, and UnifyApps—demonstrated the growing pull of extensible, open agent platforms that push Workday and system integrators to up their interop and governance games.</li>
<li>Global GSIs like KPMG put a spotlight on composable, agent-driven managed services models; Deloitte must continue evolving both technical depth and advisory sophistication to stake clear differentiated ground.</li>
<li>The employee trust gap in APAC—quantified in new Workday research—echoes broader demand for robust policy, change management, and governance skills as agentic workflows scale globally.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAP:</strong> Expanded <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/joule-in-sap-successfactors-4de4e7fb29434079ae07dffc93b64639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joule AI Assistant</a> within SuccessFactors/S/4HANA. For Deloitte clients, this means richer direct competition for Workday; careful orchestration and integration choices must be made for multivendor estates. </li>
<li><strong>UKG:</strong> Rolled out new <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryte AI Agents</a> for employee and manager-facing HR automation. Workday must keep pace in delivering deep, industry-specific agentic workflows. Deloitte needs to aid clients with comparative value realization and readiness evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle:</strong> Added unified digital assistant mode to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud HCM</a>, merging RPA and agentic AI advancements. Deloitte should emphasize long-term strategy—avoiding lock-in, maximizing interoperability, and architecting agentic platforms as sources of insight, not just automation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Engage Workday and Deloitte leaders to benchmark new Workday AI Model Library capabilities for future managed service blueprints.</li>
<li>Map competitive launches from SAP, UKG, and Oracle to develop client-facing playbooks on agentic HR/ERP solutions.</li>
<li>Advance Deloitte's governance and AI risk advisory in line with BCG agent safety frameworks.</li>
<li>Convene a deep technical session on integrating third-party and open agentic stacks into Workday SaaS configurations.</li>
<li>Launch client workshops in APAC to address workforce trust and transparency for AI agent adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Agent fragmentation leads to compliance and security risk.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Strengthen governance advisory and lifecycle management; rely on agent safety protocols from BCG and Workday.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Change resistance from employees.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Deploy robust policy, change management, and transparent communication—especially in APAC as called out by the latest Workday research.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Vendor lock-in and tool sprawl.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Prioritize open agent protocols, cost modeling, and best-fit scenario planning for each client.</li>

Deloitte’s success relies on both technical agility in newly unified agent frameworks and a consultative edge in helping clients achieve safe, responsible, and measurable enterprise AI outcomes.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Introduces New Custom AI Model Library to Power Smarter, Faster Contract Reviews (2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday rolled out a new Custom AI Model Library designed to improve contract review processes for finance and HR teams—representing a crucial stride in verticalizing agentic AI. The offering brings modular, industry-specific models embedded within the Workday platform, with an emphasis on ease-of-use for both business users and developers. This provides Deloitte&#x27;s Workday clients with a significant acceleration in contract and compliance workflows, improves downstream analytics capabilities, and positions Workday as an increasingly AI-forward HCM/ERP suite in the enterprise market. Furthermore, this underscores the vendor’s strategy of wrapping advanced agentic capabilities in controlled, compliant frameworks—something that deeply aligns with regulatory priorities and client expectations around explainability and auditability in HR processes. For Deloitte, this strengthens the case for integrating Workday AI agents into managed service and transformation offerings, offering new routes to measurable ROI and risk-managed automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;LangChain Raises $125M to Accelerate AI Agent Tooling (2025-10-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;LangChain, a leading independent AI agent tooling provider, secured $125 million in funding, highlighting growing demand for robust, developer-focused AI agent frameworks. Its success signals rapid expansion in open agent frameworks, presenting both challenges and opportunities for SaaS platform incumbents like Workday, Oracle, and SAP. The proliferation of specialist agentic AI tools, including interoperability layers, could offer Deloitte clients new flexibility but also raises complexity and integration risks, especially as Workday continues to deepen its native agent capabilities. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the move means more integration advisory opportunities, especially for clients seeking to extend or federate their agentic architectures beyond Workday’s native platform, but also a need to demonstrate clear business value and governance expertise as the agent landscape fragments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/20/ai-agent-tooling-provider-langchain-raises-125m-1-25b-valuation\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;IBM and Groq Partner to Accelerate Enterprise AI Deployment (2025-10-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IBM’s partnership with Groq aims to blend Groq’s performance AI chips and streaming LLM inference stack with IBM’s enterprise AI orchestration and security capabilities. This partnership targets deployment acceleration for agentic AI in finance, supply chain, and HR settings, rivaling Workday’s ongoing efforts with Microsoft and Google Cloud. IBM’s growing posture in agentic AI orchestration signals more alternatives and interop requirements in the SaaS ecosystem. Deloitte must track how chip-level and orchestration innovations may influence both Workday’s stack evolution and client procurement decisions, especially for regulated industries that prioritize infrastructure transparency and control.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510200600CANADANWCANADAPR_C2431-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Leena AI Opens &#x27;AI Colleague Studio&#x27; for Enterprise Agent Customization (2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Leena AI’s new &#x27;AI Colleague Studio&#x27; offers enterprises advanced tools to build, deploy, and customize virtual agents tailored to unique business functions. This move embodies the broader shift toward extensible, agentic ecosystems—forcing HCM/ERP vendors including Workday to ensure their marketplaces, dev toolsets, and governance models remain competitive. Deloitte faces growing customer demand for best-of-breed agent integration across HR and finance domains and must leverage expertise in unifying agent environments and ensuring security and compliance across disparate agent stacks.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/22/leena-opens-ai-colleague-studio-enterprise-agent-customization\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG Launches Global Business Services with Velocity for Agentic AI Transformations (2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG’s launch of a global managed services blueprint—powered by ServiceNow and agentic AI frameworks—underscores how agentic architectures are transforming both the delivery and orchestration of core business processes. The offering leverages modular, composable AI agents for finance, HR, and supply chain, ratcheting up pressure on GSIs and SaaS vendors alike. For Deloitte and its Workday alliances, KPMG’s move serves as both competitive warning and inspiration for developing differentiated, outcome-driven managed service combinations that blend SaaS-native agents with industry-specific workflow accelerators.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/10/kpmg-launches-global-business-services-with-kpmg-velocity-enabled-by-servicenow.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;UnifyApps Raises $50M, Appoints New Co-CEO to Build AI Operating System (2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;UnifyApps, an AI operating system startup, has raised $50M and appointed a new co-CEO, signaling energetic market confidence in universal agentic operating systems that aim to orchestrate agents across SaaS, data, and workflow silos.

Deloitte clients will seek guidance amid a growing morass of interoperable agents and orchestration layers, heightening demand for consulting that bridges new agentic OS paradigms with SaaS deployments such as Workday.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/22/ai-operating-system-startup-unifyapps-raises-50m-gets-new-co-ceo\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday AI Agents: Momentum in APAC and AI Workforce Boundaries (2025-10-23)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Research from Workday in Singapore illustrates strong enterprise momentum for AI agents but also highlights employee demand for clear boundaries and transparency around digital agent adoption. Seventy percent of employees want more clarity about agent versus human task assignment. For Deloitte’s APAC Workday practice, successfully navigating this friction and driving adoption requires robust change management, transparent policy design, and demonstrable links between agentic automation and talent strategy.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://en-sg.newsroom.workday.com/ai-agents-are-gaining-momentum-in-singapore-but-employees-want-clear-boundaries-workday-research\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Expansion of Joule, SAP’s embedded AI assistant in SuccessFactors and S/4HANA, with deeper agent integration across HR tasks—including intelligent recommendations and workflow automation, released this week.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s strengthening Joule agentic capabilities intensifies competition among top HCM vendors, compelling Workday to accelerate both technical depth and end-user customization features. Deloitte’s Workday teams must help clients weigh the practical tradeoffs in agent interoperability, security postures, and long-term extensibility—especially for multinational organizations scaling agentic AI across multiple SaaS estates.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;UKG launched new Bryte AI Agents, expanding their agentic HR suite for deeper employee service automation including guidance, coaching, and adaptive workflow management.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;UKG’s pace in releasing user-facing, guided HR agent experiences elevates expectations around immediate productivity gains and personalization, challenging Workday’s agentic roadmap to deliver equally seamless employee and manager-facing automation.
