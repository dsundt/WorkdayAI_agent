</ul>
<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>Between Oct 25 and Nov 1, the agentic AI landscape in SaaS accelerated in three key ways. First, analyst validation for Workday (via Gartner’s inaugural Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP Finance) reinforced its momentum as a standard-setter in embedded, operational AI for HR and finance. Second, product innovation—particularly Workday’s new custom AI model library and SAP’s TechEd focus on real-time agent grounding—shifted the spotlight to traceability, event-driven integration, and customizable agent governance at enterprise scale. Finally, the SaaS ecosystem’s power centers—Workday, SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft—are converging around agentic AI platform strategies, with partnerships (Microsoft-Workday, Oracle-NVIDIA), open API pushes, and orchestrated user experiences leading the way. There is a sense of urgency as clients seek assurance that agents are safe, auditable, and industry-compliant, raising the stakes for value realization and delivery rigor in Deloitte’s Workday transformation programs.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>SAP:</b> <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-teched-berlin-2025-real-time-data-for-ai-agents-grounding-with-event/ba-p/14252572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emphasized real-time, event-driven agentic AI at TechEd 2025</a>. SAP is betting on transparent, integrated agents with process mining and compliance as selling points. Deloitte’s multi-platform clients will demand PoCs to compare SAP/Workday agentic transparency and cross-system control.</li>
<li><b>Oracle:</b> <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/enterprise-ai-with-nvidia-nemotron-models-on-oci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deploying NVIDIA Nemotron for scalable, industry-tuned agentic AI on OCI</a>. Oracle’s play for vertical-specific agent workloads challenges Workday’s flexibility. Deloitte’s role is to provide agile, migration-friendly strategies connecting Oracle and Workday AI environments.</li>
<li><b>Microsoft:</b> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushing unified Copilot-Agentic AI with partner SaaS</a>. Microsoft’s platform-first approach makes multi-cloud, multi-agent orchestration table stakes. For Deloitte, integrating Copilot with Workday ecosystems now holds direct commercial and operational priority.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Revise Deloitte Workday agentic reference architectures to reflect AI model library, custom agent, and Copilot integration advances.</li>
<li>Run a multi-platform agent governance and performance workshop for key enterprise clients—compare Workday, SAP, Oracle frameworks.</li>
<li>Reinforce enablement on AI agent risk management using current EY governance insights.</li>
<li>Prioritize R&amp;D and delivery resources for cross-cloud/multi-agent orchestration PoCs, especially targeting regulated industry clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Governance Fragmentation:</b> Risk: Inconsistent controls and compliance across agentic systems. <b>Mitigation:</b> Align with external frameworks (EY, NIST), require vendor transparency, and maintain Deloitte-controlled audit hooks.</li>
<li><b>Client Misalignment:</b> Risk: Innovation outpaces adoption and operation. <b>Mitigation:</b> Lead education, run phased pilots, and introduce automated alerts for agentic anomalies.</li>
<li><b>Vendor Lock-in Risk:</b> Risk: Ecosystem divergence limits future migration/flexibility. <b>Mitigation:</b> Emphasize interoperability, open architectures, and develop Deloitte playbooks for flexible cloud/agent transformations.</li>

This week saw Workday&#x27;s further recognition by analysts, new tooling to accelerate agent adoption, and intensifying moves by Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft to consolidate their own agentic AI platforms—making strategic differentiation and operational governance more crucial for Deloitte’s Workday clients.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Recognized as a Leader in Inaugural Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud ERP for Finance (Oct 29, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Gartner’s new Magic Quadrant™ recognizes Workday as a Leader for its vision and execution in Cloud ERP for finance, specifically calling out Workday’s investment in embedded AI and agentic automation. The report identifies Workday’s purpose-built AI capabilities—which anticipate user needs, automate workflows, and provide intelligence across HR and finance—as differentiators, especially as agentic AI blurs lines between operational support and autonomous decision making. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this analyst validation bolsters the case for transformative client programs anchored on Workday’s AI-driven workflows, and also signals higher client expectations around continuous improvement, integration, and ROI from both core and extended AI features.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-29-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-Inaugural-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Cloud-ERP-Finance\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Introduces New Custom AI Model Library for Contract Review (Oct 22, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s custom AI model library launch enables organizations to leverage purpose-built and pre-trained models to automate contract reviews in finance and HR. This development expands work previously focused on standard workflows, introducing agentic AI that adapts to client-specific documents, business rules, and compliance scenarios. For SaaS buyers, the ability to iterate and govern their own AI models within Workday’s secure platform addresses concerns about generalist LLM risks and regulatory exposure. Deloitte can now recommend or implement verticalized review agents, helping clients increase automation confidence, reduce legal exposure, and respond dynamically to shifting industry rules.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP TechEd Berlin 2025: Real-Time Data for AI Agents and BTP Session Highlights (Oct 28-30, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;At SAP TechEd 2025, SAP showcased how its Business Technology Platform (BTP) and S/4HANA real-time data streams underpin AI agent effectiveness in enterprise workflows. The event emphasized the necessity of granular, event-driven data context to maximize autonomous agent decisions for finance, HR, and supply chain. SAP’s approach—grounding AI agents with real-time data, integration layers, and process modeling—contrasts with Workday’s model-focused innovations, but also suggests a pattern: Both ecosystems are racing to make agentic AI trustworthy and retraceable in critical business contexts. Deloitte’s SAP/Workday clients need multi-cloud agentic governance, and this development signals that integration and data mesh strategies will rise in importance alongside AI agent orchestration.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-teched-berlin-2025-real-time-data-for-ai-agents-grounding-with-event/ba-p/14252572\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Partners with NVIDIA for Enterprise AI Model Deployment on OCI (Oct 27, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s extended partnership with NVIDIA at the infrastructure and platform layer (OCI) enables verticalized, real-time AI-powered automation for Oracle Cloud clients using Nemotron foundation models. This move positions Oracle to compete aggressively for SaaS agent workloads, especially where industry-specific models and large-scale compute support are essential—such as in financial services, procurement, and operations. The open, enterprise-oriented stack reinforces Oracle’s bid to keep large SaaS customers from migrating to Workday- or SAP-led agent ecosystems. For Deloitte, this signals heightened demand for cloud-to-cloud migration skills and guides firms to evaluate whether best-of-breed or platform-native agentic AI delivers better value.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/enterprise-ai-with-nvidia-nemotron-models-on-oci\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft and Workday Pursue Unified AI Agent Experience (Sep 16, validated in competitive media, Oct 25–31, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Recent weeks saw Workday and Microsoft deepening their collaboration to deliver a unified agent experience, integrating Microsoft Copilot with Workday’s agentic AI for enterprise HR and finance. As cited in multiple sources, this partnership aims to streamline user engagement, data flow, and governance between productivity platforms and SaaS transactional systems. For the broader SaaS ecosystem, the convergence of Microsoft’s productivity suite and Workday’s transactional depth brings new standards for seamless, cross-app AI-driven workflows. For Deloitte practitioners, this is a blueprint for orchestrating unified digital work experiences and raises essential questions about platform interoperability, data residency, and cross-platform risk management.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Unveiled event-driven real-time data services and agentic AI enablement at TechEd 2025, focused on S/4HANA and BTP environments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s positioning around data-centricity, integration architecture, and traceable agentic decisions suggests a parallel to Workday’s agentic advances, but with more emphasis on process mining and compliance tracing. Deloitte SAP/Workday teams should anticipate client requests for comparative PoCs evaluating agent transparency, governance layers, and cross-platform agent orchestration between BTP, Workday, and potentially Microsoft’s Copilot frameworks.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Extended its OCI platform with NVIDIA Nemotron foundation models for advanced, customizable AI agent deployment in core SaaS workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s focus on verticalized, enterprise-grade AI—particularly with strong support for real-time, industry-aligned use cases—means that clients may increasingly weigh deep ecosystem integration (Oracle/NVIDIA) against best-of-breed Workday agentic AI. Deloitte’s Oracle teams need to respond with migration, harmonization, and hybrid agent governance strategies to compete effectively.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Accelerated unification of Copilot framework with partner SaaS applications, including Workday, to offer genuinely integrated user and workflow AI agents.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft’s strategy is to place Copilot as both the interface and execution engine for agentic workflows, whether embedded in Office, Teams, or partner SaaS systems. This puts pressure on Workday (and all SaaS vendors) to extend API openness, unify orchestration standards, and actively coordinate governance.
