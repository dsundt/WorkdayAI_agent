Gartner points to Workday's ability to provide robust AI-driven planning and data reliability, strengthening its appeal for clients facing complex compliance and visionary transformation needs. This independently validates the credibility of Workday's agentic approach and offers Deloitte a market-differentiating narrative for intelligent finance modernization, particularly relevant for regulated industries and clients prioritizing transparency and trust in AI deployment.</p></li><li><b>Workday President to Speak at Barclays 23rd Global Technology Conference (Announced 2025-12-04)</b><br><p><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-President-to-Present-at-Barclays-23rd-Annual-Global-Technology-Conference-on-December-11,-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday's participation</a> at Barclays' global tech conference positions it at the vanguard of the rapidly evolving conversation about AI governance, risk, and extensibility in enterprise SaaS. Executive-level visibility at such high-profile industry events often foreshadows upcoming product strategy and market engagement directions. For Deloitte, this is a timely intelligence opportunity, helping to anticipate Workday client concerns and to proactively shape solution offerings that align with the latest executive messaging.</p></li><li><b>AWS Doubles Down on Enterprise AI with New Model Integrations (Published 2025-12-05)</b><br><p><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/05/reinvent-aws-strikes-back-ai-new-chips-models-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS's re:Invent announcements</a>, which include new AI chips, agent orchestration controls, and trusted deployment mechanisms, intensify the arms race for enterprise AI in the SaaS space. AWS's focus on secure, compliant, and open model integration sets a new benchmark for agentic interoperability. This directly impacts Deloitte’s deployment strategies: integrating AWS controls and agent orchestration concepts will be crucial in client architectures that span Workday, SAP, Amazon, and Microsoft clouds.</p></li><li><b>Snowflake and Workday Deepen Partnership for AI-Driven Enterprise Integration (Published 2025-12-03)</b><br><p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/workday-partnership-ai-driven-enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake's expanded partnership with Workday</a> tackles critical legacy barriers to real-time, multi-domain analytics in HR and finance by enabling AI-driven, bidirectional agentic data flows. This brings to life advanced use-cases in people analytics, risk management, and financial scenario planning. The extended solution multiplies the value for Deloitte-led transformations, supporting delivery of unified agent and data service architectures for clients pursuing broad-based AI automation.</p></li><li><b>Gartner’s 2025 ITDR Report: Okta Cited as ITDR Platform Leader (Published 2025-12-02)</b><br><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/ko-kr/blog/industry-insights/okta-kuppingercole-2025-itdr-leader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta’s recognition</a> as an ITDR leader by KuppingerCole and Gartner foregrounds the rising importance of agent-identity management as AI-driven digital workers proliferate across hybrid ecosystems. Identity security now extends to AI agents within enterprise audit, risk, and compliance models—reinforcing Workday’s and Deloitte’s emphasis on federated, trustworthy SaaS deployments. This elevation of agent identities shapes the requirements for end-to-end, risk-controlled SaaS transformation strategies.</p></li></ul><h3>What changed this week</h3><p>The last week marks a crystallization of agentic AI as a core competency in leading SaaS and cloud ecosystems. Workday solidifies its agentic leadership with external validation from Gartner, fresh executive-level industry advocacy, and deeper strategic integration with data and identify providers (Snowflake, Okta). AWS’s powerful advances in AI orchestration and trust controls raise expectations for open, secure, and scalable agentic solutions in the cloud. The common thread is convergence on agent lifecycle management—governed, integrated, and auditable across hybrid platforms—signaling to enterprise clients that secure, extensible, multi-agent architectures are no longer aspirational but essential. For Deloitte, this environment unlocks differentiated advisory and delivery opportunities if we can rapidly enable our teams with reference architectures, compliance playbooks, and client education aligned with these developments.</p><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><b>AWS</b>: <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/05/reinvent-aws-strikes-back-ai-new-chips-models-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New chips, agent controls, cross-cloud integration at re:Invent</a> raises the bar for secure, scalable agent deployment and interoperability.

Deloitte must leverage these developments for differentiated advisory and implementation offerings.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Named a Leader Again in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning (Published 2025-12-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday&#x27;s continued status as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Financial Planning Software, recognized for the fourth consecutive year, marks a significant endorsement of its innovation and execution consistency. Gartner highlights Workday’s deep integration of AI agents to drive process automation, scenario modeling, and improved data reliability for finance teams. This recognition signals Workday’s trajectory as not only a cloud ERP innovator but now as an agentic AI powerhouse for complex enterprise scenarios.\\n\\nFor the broader SaaS ecosystem, this places pressure on competitors like SAP and Oracle to articulate how their AI and agentic frameworks can match Workday’s integration, extensibility, and performance. For Deloitte, this recognition is a potent credential to anchor transformation projects, especially those focusing on finance modernization and intelligent planning. It reinforces the value of aligning digital operating models around Workday’s agent-driven architecture, supporting risk-managed adoption in regulated sectors.\\n\\nSo what: Deloitte can sharpen its value proposition by coupling its finance transformation experience with Workday&#x27;s validated leadership in AI for financial planning, providing clients with assurance, agility, and a path toward autonomous financial operations.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-2025-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Financial-Planning-Software-for-Fourth-Year-in-a-Row\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday President to Speak at Barclays 23rd Global Technology Conference (Announced 2025-12-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s executive presence at premier industry events like the Barclays Global Technology Conference offers a rare window into strategy, R&amp;D focus, and customer engagement priorities—especially relevant as agentic AI becomes central to clients’ digital blueprints. Announcements made at these forums often presage product extension directions and ecosystem partnerships. The announcement signals Workday’s intention to continue shaping the narrative on agent management, AI transparency, and SaaS extensibility.\\n\\nThe broader implication for SaaS vendors is the increasing importance of executive-level advocacy and education on AI risks, governance, and business value realization—not just technical innovation. For Deloitte, close tracking of these keynotes yields competitive intelligence and enables early alignment of solution offerings to match client curiosity and market timing.\\n\\nSo what: Deloitte teams should prepare response materials and thought leadership aligned to Workday’s keynote messaging, enabling proactive positioning in client discussions post-event.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-President-to-Present-at-Barclays-23rd-Annual-Global-Technology-Conference-on-December-11,-2025\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AWS Doubles Down on Enterprise AI with New Model Integrations (Published 2025-12-05)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;At AWS re:Invent, Amazon unveiled major expansions in its AI portfolio, including new chips, models, and cross-cloud integration capabilities. These moves directly challenge Google and Microsoft’s enterprise AI positioning and create a more competitive environment for work automation, particularly as AWS AgentCore and Bedrock gain adoption for trusted AI agents. AWS’s focus on policy controls and quality evaluation for AI agent deployment mirrors Workday’s compliance and assurance-first approach.\\n\\nFor enterprise SaaS players, this cross-cloud agent interoperability raises the bar. Customers are increasingly expecting seamless integration between SaaS agent frameworks and hyperscaler toolkits—demanding greater technical openness from Workday, SAP, and Oracle. Deloitte must be ready to help clients navigate and orchestrate these integrations, ensuring secure and governed agent deployments across cloud estates.\\n\\nSo what: Deloitte’s Workday practice can differentiate through multi-cloud agent orchestration strategies, leveraging AWS innovations in its advisory toolkit to future-proof client agentic architectures.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/05/reinvent-aws-strikes-back-ai-new-chips-models-story\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Snowflake and Workday Deepen Partnership for AI-Driven Enterprise Integration (Published 2025-12-03)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;The strategic partnership between Snowflake and Workday now enables bidirectional data and AI service integration, accelerating the unification of HR, finance, and operational data for real-time analytics and GenAI agent enablement. This move tackles major enterprise pain points around fragmentation and data latency for agent-powered processes, while positioning both platforms as foundational to the connected, intelligent workplace.\\n\\nThis development puts pressure on competing data clouds and SaaS platforms to not only support open connectors but to demonstrate true agent-to-agent collaboration capabilities. Enterprises benefit via streamlined compliance, more powerful analytics, and accelerated time-to-value for AI-driven workflows. For Deloitte, the expanded integration multiplies use case possibilities, supporting more advanced, data-centric agentic designs for client environments.\\n\\nSo what: Deloitte should accelerate cross-solution architectures integrating Workday and Snowflake, enabling clients to unlock multi-domain agent automation and next-gen people analytics.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/workday-partnership-ai-driven-enterprise\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Gartner’s 2025 ITDR Report: Okta Cited as ITDR Platform Leader (Published 2025-12-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;The latest KuppingerCole and Gartner reports spotlight Okta’s leadership in Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR), as enterprise AI agent ecosystems become more target-rich for cyber risk. Okta’s identity security fabric extends controls to AI agents as first-class digital identities, a framework being echoed by Microsoft and Workday for agent lifecycle governance. Identity-centric security, now a board-level concern, is a growing requirement as organizations assign decision-making autonomy to AI-powered SaaS agents.\\n\\nThis substantiates the shift from traditional, user-only IAM to agent-inclusive approaches—impacting solution design and auditability for all SaaS players. Workday’s own agent system of record philosophy integrates with such trends, giving customers a compliance edge. Deloitte must help clients extend identity, compliance, and zero-trust frameworks to encompass both human and non-human workers.\\n\\nSo what: Deloitte&#x27;s Workday teams should develop accelerators mapping agent identity integration to prevailing security and compliance models, leveraging Okta and similar platforms.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.okta.com/ko-kr/blog/industry-insights/okta-kuppingercole-2025-itdr-leader\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;AWS\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced new AI chips, agent orchestration controls, and advanced model integrations at re:Invent, focusing on cross-cloud openness and trusted agent deployment.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This positions AWS as a major enabler for scalable, secure enterprise AI deployments, intensifying the demand for interoperable agent frameworks among SaaS vendors, including Workday, SAP, and Oracle.

The extended solution multiplies the value for Deloitte-led transformations, supporting delivery of unified agent and data service architectures for clients pursuing broad-based AI automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gartner’s 2025 ITDR Report: Okta Cited as ITDR Platform Leader (Published 2025-12-02)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.okta.com/ko-kr/blog/industry-insights/okta-kuppingercole-2025-itdr-leader\\\&quot;&gt;Okta’s recognition&lt;/a&gt; as an ITDR leader by KuppingerCole and Gartner foregrounds the rising importance of agent-identity management as AI-driven digital workers proliferate across hybrid ecosystems. Identity security now extends to AI agents within enterprise audit, risk, and compliance models—reinforcing Workday’s and Deloitte’s emphasis on federated, trustworthy SaaS deployments. This elevation of agent identities shapes the requirements for end-to-end, risk-controlled SaaS transformation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What changed this week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last week marks a crystallization of agentic AI as a core competency in leading SaaS and cloud ecosystems. Workday solidifies its agentic leadership with external validation from Gartner, fresh executive-level industry advocacy, and deeper strategic integration with data and identify providers (Snowflake, Okta). AWS’s powerful advances in AI orchestration and trust controls raise expectations for open, secure, and scalable agentic solutions in the cloud. The common thread is convergence on agent lifecycle management—governed, integrated, and auditable across hybrid platforms—signaling to enterprise clients that secure, extensible, multi-agent architectures are no longer aspirational but essential. For Deloitte, this environment unlocks differentiated advisory and delivery opportunities if we can rapidly enable our teams with reference architectures, compliance playbooks, and client education aligned with these developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWS&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/05/reinvent-aws-strikes-back-ai-new-chips-models-story\\\&quot;&gt;New chips, agent controls, cross-cloud integration at re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; raises the bar for secure, scalable agent deployment and interoperability. Deloitte must invest in multi-cloud agent orchestration to maintain advisory leadership as clients increasingly demand SaaS, data cloud, and IaaS convergence for AI agents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snowflake&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/workday-partnership-ai-driven-enterprise\\\&quot;&gt;Expanded real-time agentic integration with Workday&lt;/a&gt; sets new expectations for agent-to-agent data flows and composable analytics in HR and finance, advancing the argument for unified data and agent governance.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Inside NetSuite&#x27;s next act: Evan Goldberg on the future of ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;This takes NetSuite&#x27;s flexibility to a new level,\&quot; Goldberg says, enabling customers and partners to \&quot;quickly and easily build AI agents, connect external AI assistants, and orchestrate AI processes.\&quot;\n\n### “AI execution fabric” delivers measurable business impact [...] At SuiteWorld 2025 last month, the Austin-based firm unveiled NetSuite Next. Goldberg calls it \&quot;the biggest product evolution in the company&#x27;s history.” The reason? While NetSuite has embedded AI capabilities into workflows for years, he explains, Next represents a quantum leap — contextual, conversational, agentic, composable AI becoming an extension of operations, not separate tools.\n\n### AI woven into everyday business operations [...] Most enterprise AI today gets bolted on through APIs and conversational interfaces.\n\nNetSuite Next operates differently. Intelligence runs deep in workflows instead of sitting on the surface. It autonomously reconciles accounts, optimizes payment timing, predicts cash crunches, and surfaces its reasoning at every step. It doesn&#x27;t just advise on business processes — it executes them, transparently, within human-defined guardrails.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;8 Common Data Integration Issues and How to Address ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Effective integration breaks down silos, enabling real-time insights, streamlined workflows, and the advanced AI use cases that depend on high-quality, trusted data. When integration falls short, organizations risk inconsistent reporting, operational inefficiencies, and stalled AI initiatives—making a strong integration strategy essential for any modern data-driven enterprise.\n\n## Key takeaways [...] Blocked AI initiatives: AI and machine learning models require large data sets of high-quality and integrated data for training. Data silos and poor data quality prevent organizations from building such comprehensive training data sets. Semantic inconsistencies cause models to learn incorrect patterns, while an inability to integrate real-time data prevents the deployment of critical AI applications like fraud detection. [...] Organizations today collect data from countless sources—internal databases, CRM systems, cloud SaaS platforms, social media channels, and IoT devices. Yet this data often arrives in different formats, at varying quality levels, and spread across disconnected systems. The result is persistent data silos that slow operations, limit visibility, and hinder strategic decision-making. According to recent industry analyses, failed data integration projects cost enterprises millions each year in lost&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally. A working day could be the same as that, but is perhaps more often used for the hours of the day you&#x27;re at work. If something happens during the working day, it happens between 9 and 5.30 or whenever. My working day was busy yesterday.\n\nS\n\n#### sasmith\n\n##### Member\n\nBritish English\n\n #5 [...] WordReference.com Language Forums\n\n Rules/Help/FAQ\n Members \n\n  Current visitors\n Interface Language\n\nMenu\n\nLog in\n\nRegister\n\nInstall the app\n\nHow to install the app on iOS\n\nFollow along with the video below to see how to install our site as a web app on your home screen.\n\nNote: This feature may not be available in some browsers.\n\n English Only\n English Only [...] So, you might say &#x27;As Wednesday was a work day, I couldn&#x27;t stay up late on Tuesday&#x27;; or &#x27;I always spend the working day dreaming of holidays&#x27;.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;workday is AE, then (I didn&#x27;t know that)  \n   \n I believe we would only say a working day for a day when you you choose or are assigned to work (if you don&#x27;t have a standard Mon-Fri work assignment).  \n   \n Next week Saturday is a working day (or workday) for me, so I can&#x27;t play golf then.

[...] Well the link clears up this debate for me, which I had until now not clearly understood  \n   \n jour ouvré in AE is business day, vs jour ouvrable, workday  \n   \n The other thread gives the example of receiving a ticket after x jours ouvrés (càd sans compter les samedis, dimanches ou autres jours fériés). In AE we would say \&quot;your ticket will be sent x business days after it is ordered.\&quot; (i.e., not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays)\n\n#### Nicomon\n\n##### Senior Member [...] I also say workday, for jour ouvrable, though I don&#x27;t mind working day. But jour ouvrable suivant = next business day. I thik business day is mostly used for commerce and finance.   \n   \n Now - as already suggested - there is a difference to be made between jour ouvré and jour ouvrable.   \n   \n As found in the GDT, under jour ouvrable  \n&gt; Définition :  \n&gt;  Jour de la semaine qui est normalement consacré au travail ou aux activités professionnelles et qui n&#x27;est pas un jour férié.&quot;,

Is the second one used more frequently than the first? (In the examples like \&quot;the centre is open on working days/ weekdays\&quot;)\n\nLast edited: [...] Yes, weekdays are the days from Monday to Friday, as opposed to the weekend. This is the usual expression if you mean those five days. We&#x27;d talk about working days only if there was a possibility of them being different - so &#x27;working days&#x27; excludes public holidays. A bank might guarantee to clear a cheque (put the money in your account) within three working days. So if you put it in on the Thursday the day before Easter, you might not get the money for almost a week, because the Easter holidays&quot;,

As artificial intelligence leads to surging workloads, Oracle Corp. is seeing strong enthusiasm around multicloud collaboration and AI database efforts, according to Nathan Thomas (pictured), vice president of product management at Oracle. [...] “To give you an idea, there’s two live regions today. We’ve announced that there’ll be 20 more coming soon. We’re out with 19c and then, of course, just updated to 26ai,” Thomas said. “Customers are just consistently saying that they’re excited about taking that mission-critical data set they’ve had in the Oracle databases and starting to leverage it for AI data pipelines and being able to use it with all of the [applications].” [...] “[It’s the] same mentality of saying, yeah, you can get Exadata, you can get Autonomous Database, you get all of our [Autonomous Recovery Services] systems for recovery, you get all of the same migration capabilities [and] zero downtime migration capabilities,” he explained. “And now things like Autonomous AI Lakehouse, it’s all the same set of tech. You can run it in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure], you can run it in all of the cloud vendors.”&quot;,

This enhancement allows agents to perform various tasks without\nleaving the agent workspace, such as:\n\nCompleting new training prompts upon login\n\nAccessing company-specific phone directories during contact transfers\n\nFilling out forms in pop-up windows\n\nDownloading files [...] Agents can manually prioritize the next important task, email, or chat in a queue.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## The blueprint: Your Anypoint AI gateway\n\nAn AI Gateway is a dedicated API layer that acts as a single, managed entry point for all AI service requests in your organization. It intercepts every call, applies critical governance policies, and then securely routes the request to the appropriate AI provider. Building this with MuleSoft is a natural fit. You can design, implement, and manage the entire gateway using the tools you already know.\n\nHere’s the basic architecture: [...] 1. Centralized authentication and authorization: Apply a Client ID Enforcement or JWT Validation policy in API Manager. This ensures that only registered and approved applications within your organization can access AI models, immediately shutting down shadow AI usage. [...] ([a-zA-Z0-9.\\_-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.\\_-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9\\_-]+)/ with “REDACTED\\_EMAIL”\n4. Standardize and enhance prompts: Your gateway can automatically inject standardized instructions or company-specific context into every prompt. This ensures AI responses are consistently formatted, adhere to your brand’s voice, and leverage relevant internal knowledge.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Workday unveils new agents, a new cloud, and a developer platform\n\nNews\n\nSep 16, 20254 mins\n\nArtificial IntelligenceCloud ComputingWorkday\n\n## It’s challenging the monolithic single-vendor approach to ERP by partnering with Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce.\n\nWorkday kicked off its annual Workday Rising conference with a series of announcements – and they weren’t all about AI.\n\nTwo of them, however, definitely were. [...] ## Workday Data Cloud\n\nTo connect HR and finance data to existing analytics and operational platforms, the company announced Workday Data Cloud. It includes Workday Data Lake, based on Apache Iceberg, to give access to data across all Workday components; Workday Data Connect to enable two-way, zero-copy data sharing between Workday and Snowflake, Databricks, and Salesforce; Workday Live Data Query to provide direct SQL access to core data; and Workday Prism for data management. [...] With these announcements, said Brue, “Workday is directly challenging SAP and Oracle’s integrated, single-vendor ERP approaches by embracing openness over vendor lock-in. While traditional providers emphasize comprehensive proprietary solutions, Workday looks to allow customers to use best-of-breed analytics platforms like Snowflake and Databricks while keeping Workday as the authoritative source for HR and finance data. This partnership model could become a template for other enterprise&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Generative AI and the SBO  \nGenerative AI is rapidly becoming the cognitive engine of the SBO. It doesn’t just automate skill tagging or matching – it continuously senses, interprets and predicts workforce capabilities in motion. By mapping emerging skills to evolving work, GenAI enables organizations to dynamically design roles, personalize learning and anticipate workforce shifts. [...] But AI’s power only translates into impact when it fuels a connected skills intelligence ecosystem that blends skills data from learning, talent acquisition and performance systems. GenAI provides the intelligence layer, and human judgment provides the wisdom layer. Human capability isn’t replaced but amplified, as static job data feeds a living, learning skills network. [...] Existing HR suites are increasingly including skills functionalities, making the need to move to skills-specialized solutions less urgent. Comparing those suites to point solutions, we’ve found that specific skills functionalities are better in tools from vendors like Eightfold, SkyHive, Gloat, Fuel50, Retrain.ai and TechWolf, but they add integration complexity. Suite vendors like Workday and SAP SuccessFactors have created a middle ground for this to work with certified skills intelligence&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Prioritize data integrity and transparency: The power of AI relies on clean, relevant data. HR teams must ensure that any systems feeding AI are integrated and transparent about what data is used, further building employee trust. [...] By adopting AI for performance feedback, HR leaders are doing more than just modernizing a system—they are building a human-centric workplace where every employee receives the specific support they need to grow, where trust is built on fairness, and where talent strategy directly contributes to measurable business success.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;But progress comes with responsibility. AI isn’t flawless, it reflects us. It learns from our data, our decisions and our blind spots. That’s why HR must own the ethical layer, from data governance and training protocols, specifying what the agent can access, what it can act on, and what remains out of bounds. To oversight and accountability. As the OECD notes, risks such as discrimination, lack of transparency, and weak oversight remain key challenges in workplace AI.4 If we want AI to work [...] Success trigger: Build internal fluency in three key areas: prompt design, data literacy, and responsible AI oversight. These are the new fundamentals of organizational readiness, alongside with these checkpoints:\n\n Bias detection processes\n Explainability of AI decisions\n Clear escalation paths\n\nThat’s why a strong foundation matters. It means defining who is accountable for the agent&#x27;s outputs, creating audit trails, and ensuring explainability. [...] HR’s role doesn’t end with its own workflows. With its knowhow in onboarding, learning, and capability building, HR is uniquely positioned to train AI agents across the enterprise. That means ensuring that Eli—and every AI agent like them—is deployed with purpose, managed responsibly, and developed to deliver sustainable impact.&quot;,

About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. [...] Our research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI [...] Chapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI.

Internal-facing agents follow the same data governance rules as other systems. Agents retrieve data that the requesting user has authorization to access. Pass the user&#x27;s identity or token securely when querying data, ensuring session integrity and least privilege. For example, an internal helpdesk agent shows an employee only their own HR record, not someone else&#x27;s. Align agent behavior with existing role-based access controls to maintain compliance and [...] 5. Standardize data integrations. Standardize how agents connect to knowledge and tools to reduce duplication and simplify maintenance. Use official APIs and connectors instead of custom integrations. Multiple agents across departments (IT, HR, facilities) reuse infrastructure, reduce operational costs, and accelerate deployment timelines. Support agents with a shared knowledge base for company policies. When integrating knowledge and tools, follow governance policies that use project-level&quot;,

[...] “Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making tools have great potential to improve our lives, including in the area of employment,” Burrows said. “At the same time, the EEOC is keenly aware that these tools may mask and perpetuate bias or create new discriminatory barriers to jobs. We must work to ensure that these new technologies do not become a high-tech pathway to discrimination.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The move towards monitoring HR tools and applications for bias is gaining traction worldwide, driven by various global and domestic data privacy laws and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In line with this trend, the New York City Council has enacted new regulations requiring organizations to conduct yearly bias audits on automated employment decision-making tools used by HR departments. [...] The new rules, which passed in December 2021 with enforcement, will require organizations that use algorithmic HR tools to conduct a yearly bias audit. As per the new law, noncompliant organizations may face fines ranging from no less than USD 500 to no more than USD 1500 for each violation.\n\nTo prepare for this shift, some organizations are developing a yearly evaluation, mitigation, and review process. Here’s a suggestion for how that might work in practice.\n\n## Step one – Evaluate [...] As governments around the world implement regulations regarding the use of AI and automation, organizations should evaluate and revise their processes to address compliance with new regulations. This means that processes utilizing algorithmic AI and automation should be carefully scrutinized and tested for impact according to the specific regulations in each state, city, or locality. With numerous rules varying in degree, organizations should stay informed and comply with the requirements to&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Lucas states that the law is clear that national origin discrimination applies to any national origin group, including discrimination against American workers in favor of foreign workers.\n\nAI\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the EEOC took the position that algorithmic hiring software and HR tools can create a “disparate impact.” The theory is that neutrally applied workplace practices can discriminate if they disproportionately affect people in protected classes. [...] The EEOC under Lucas has since removed some AI-related documents while it reviews them in line with a Trump order that revoked Biden administration-era AI policies. The Trump administration is unlikely to prioritize disparate impact claims related to AI discrimination, and a recent memo from the attorney general directed the DOJ to limit the use of disparate impact theories.\n\nDEI Programs [...] In the meantime, the EEOC is declining to enforce the harassment guidance by dismissing its own lawsuits alleging sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination filed under the Biden administration. One such case is the EEOC’s against Harmony Hospitality LLC, which operates a Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel in Alabama. This month, the EEOC filed a joint motion to dismiss its case, just eight months after the agency sued the company over its firing of an employee who identifies as nonbinary&quot;,

[...] Although no federal law specifically addresses the use of AI in the employment context (yet), discrimination is already prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and a host of other federal, state and local laws.\n\nAs such, preventing algorithmic bias is essential regardless of the outcome of pending AI legislation.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In an HR context, biased AI algorithms used for resume screening may favor candidates from certain demographic backgrounds, leading to a lack of diversity in hiring practices.\n In the finance sector, AI systems used for credit scoring may inadvertently disadvantage individuals from minority groups due to historical data reflecting systemic inequalities, resulting in fewer loan approvals for these applicants. [...] 2. Algorithmic bias: Algorithmic bias arises from the design and implementation of algorithms themselves. Even with unbiased data, the way algorithms process information can introduce bias. For instance, if an algorithm is optimized for efficiency without considering fairness, it may prioritize certain outcomes over others, resulting in discriminatory practices. [...] Bias in AI systems refers to systematic and unfair discrimination that arises from the design, development and deployment of AI technologies. It can manifest in various forms, including algorithmic bias, data bias and human bias, leading to outcomes that disproportionately affect certain groups of people based on characteristics such as race, gender, age or socioeconomic status.&quot;,

[...] That one-page guidance from the EEOC states that potential business rationales, such as labor costs, customer preferences, or stereotypes, do not justify discriminatory practices. Additionally, the EEOC’s one-pager and updated national origin resources flag several high‑risk areas: visa‑status preferences in job ads (e.g., “H‑1B only” or “H‑1B preferred”); disparate treatment in application and promotion processes that make it harder for U.S. workers to advance; and retaliation or harassment [...] On November 24, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced a formal partnership with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Project Firewall to intensify enforcement against employers engaging in unlawful national origin discrimination, including hiring practices that disadvantage American workers.&quot;,

As part of this assessment, employers should continue to be deliberate and strategic about their actions, particularly given the drastic changes over the past two months and the lack, to date, of guidance on some important remaining issues.  While DEI [...] While the Executive Orders explicitly articulated the federal government’s intent to root out and punish “illegal DEI,” employers lacked guidance concerning the meaning and scope of this term.  The technical assistance guidelines released this week answer some, but not all, questions about the meaning and scope of “illegal DEI”.&quot;,

While national origin discrimination has long been prohibited, the EEOC’s refreshed technical assistance and updated national origin landing page signal a renewed enforcement priority, particularly where employment decisions interact with immigration-related processes. For employers and business leaders, the message is clear: employment [...] such as customer preference, cost efficiencies, or perceptions regarding skill or work ethic do not justify differential treatment based on visa status or national origin.

The actions tend to call into question employer practices that punish employees for unexcused absences or missed time (including to attend medical appointments) that is due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. [...] The PWFA, which President Joe Biden signed into law on December 29, 2022, and which took effect on June 27, 2023, requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to workers for the known limitations of pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. On April 19, 2024, the EEOC published its final rule and interpretive guidance implementing the PWFA, which clarified the agency’s interpretation of “qualified” employees and reasonable accommodations. The final regulations [...] In the lawsuit, the EEOC alleged the employer had failed to accommodate an employee who experienced a stillbirth. The employee had sent the employer a doctor’s note stating that she could not return to work for “approximately six (6) weeks to recuperate and to grieve.” However, a day after receiving the note, the employer terminated the employee’s employment without engaging in the interactive process.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As more employers adopt artificial intelligence tools as part of the everyday workflow, AI also is creeping into a key part of employees’ lives: performance reviews.\n\nCompanies that have adopted the technology seek to make the process easier, particularly for managers who might otherwise have to track down disparate bits of information from different sources. \n\nBut it’s not as easy as telling managers and workers that it’s OK to start using ChatGPT. [...] “This exposes employers to Title VII, ADA and Age Discrimination in Employment Act claims,” he said. “Even ‘neutral’ algorithms can create disparate impact if they disadvantage protected groups.” He added that even if the AI tool is from a third-party vendor, it doesn’t protect an employer from liability. [...] Data privacy should be a concern as well: “AI tools designed to enhance performance reviews may rely on the use of personal employee information and any misuse could subject the organization to privacy related claims, including those arising from information security breaches,” he said, plus “employees may have rights to know how their data is used in the context of employer conducted performance reviews.”\n\n purchase licensing rights\n\nFiled Under: Talent,  HR Tech &amp; Analytics&quot;,

The &#x27;scaling paradox&#x27; remains the central risk: how to rapidly deploy AI and new technologies without exponentially increasing security vulnerabilities. The solution lies not in more point products, but in a unified identity security fabric that simplifies control and strengthens protection. [...] Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping entire industries, including the US federal government, where it&#x27;s moving from an emerging technology to a central strategic priority. The MeriTalk 2026 Federal CIO Forecast confirms this shift, with AI and infrastructure modernization rocketing to the top of the priority list and cybersecurity remaining the bedrock for all initiatives.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Generative AI and the SBO  \nGenerative AI is rapidly becoming the cognitive engine of the SBO. It doesn’t just automate skill tagging or matching – it continuously senses, interprets and predicts workforce capabilities in motion. By mapping emerging skills to evolving work, GenAI enables organizations to dynamically design roles, personalize learning and anticipate workforce shifts. [...] Discover how the skills-based organisation is shifting from concept to actionable strategy: harnessing generative AI, navigating a crowded tech landscape, and solving governance and culture challenges. Through client case studies, learn practical steps, common pitfalls and how a guided pilot can accelerate measurable talent mobility, resilience and lasting cost savings. [...] But AI’s power only translates into impact when it fuels a connected skills intelligence ecosystem that blends skills data from learning, talent acquisition and performance systems. GenAI provides the intelligence layer, and human judgment provides the wisdom layer. Human capability isn’t replaced but amplified, as static job data feeds a living, learning skills network.&quot;,

With its knowhow in onboarding, learning, and capability building, HR is uniquely positioned to train AI agents across the enterprise. That means ensuring that Eli—and every AI agent like them—is deployed with purpose, managed responsibly, and developed to deliver sustainable impact. [...] Just like any new employee, Eli doesn’t magically understand how your company works on day one. You wouldn’t just drop them into the system and expect results; you would onboard them. You would introduce them to your processes, values, data, and tools. You would define their scope, test their skills, and coach them along the way. It’s the same for AI Agents.&quot;,

Comparing those suites to point solutions, we’ve found that specific skills functionalities are better in tools from vendors like Eightfold, SkyHive, Gloat, Fuel50, Retrain.ai and TechWolf, but they add integration complexity. Suite vendors like Workday and SAP SuccessFactors have created a middle ground for this to work with certified skills intelligence [...] But AI’s power only translates into impact when it fuels a connected skills intelligence ecosystem that blends skills data from learning, talent acquisition and performance systems. GenAI provides the intelligence layer, and human judgment provides the wisdom layer. Human capability isn’t replaced but amplified, as static job data feeds a living, learning skills network.&quot;,

The &#x27;scaling paradox&#x27; remains the central risk: how to rapidly deploy AI and new technologies without exponentially increasing security vulnerabilities. The solution lies not in more point products, but in a unified identity security fabric that simplifies control and strengthens protection. [...] Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping entire industries, including the US federal government, where it&#x27;s moving from an emerging technology to a central strategic priority. The MeriTalk 2026 Federal CIO Forecast confirms this shift, with AI and infrastructure modernization rocketing to the top of the priority list and cybersecurity remaining the bedrock for all initiatives.&quot;,

[...] But a spreadsheet that anyone can edit isn’t necessarily what you want when you’re working with data that’s complex, sensitive or complexly sensitive. Those use cases include a lot of the data that workers put into spreadsheets. There was also the lock-in factor from Microsoft’s dominance of PC software. “We thought Google Sheets was going to kill Excel, but it didn’t,” says Ozzie, the onetime VisiCalc (and Lotus) employee who was Microsoft’s chief software architect from 2006 to 2010.

Yet even as digital health matures, access and experience gaps persist. Over half of respondents agree that the U.S. healthcare system is “fundamentally broken,” and 58% say access to care still depends on income or status.¹ [...] AI and advanced analytics are powering new science and accelerating medical discovery. But their broader value lies in helping organizations communicate with empathy at scale.

Without an update to how content is managed, that means smaller hotels and niche brands risk disappearing from AI-generated results.\n\n## Transaction still lags—but readiness can’t [...] Steps to consider:\n\n Design the experience. Map how travelers interact across search, plan, book, and manage, then shape your site’s flow, brand voice, and interface to match. Add clear confirmations, smart defaults, and guardrails for things like accuracy, change fees, and fare rules.\n\n Make real-time data accessible. Expose real-time availability, pricing, ancillaries, loyalty profiles and balances, and payments via secure, permissioned APIs that an AI agent can discover. [...] The promise of travel sites has always been easy discovery and confident booking. But AI raises the bar: travelers now expect a conversational planner that understands intent, constraints, and loyalty value in one flow. The question is how to turn your site into a smart, on-brand assistant that captures demand instead of ceding it to aggregators.&quot;,

And beyond clinical care, Microsoft introduced pre-built “Employee Self-Service” Copilot agents for enterprise workflows that can connect into systems like Workday or ServiceNow. Imagine an HR help bot or an IT support bot that hospital staff can query right from Teams – these can now be built or deployed through Copilot Studio, further integrating AI into daily operations. [...] One of the most immediate ways AI Copilots are changing HLS is by enhancing day-to-day productivity for healthcare workers. Microsoft 365 Copilot serves as an ever-ready assistant across the Outlook email, Teams collaboration, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and more. For healthcare professionals, this means a dramatic reduction in the time spent searching, summarizing, or drafting routine content: [...] “decades of clinical expertise with Microsoft’s scale, security, and commitment to innovation”. This is a prime example of how modern work tools and AI are merging in healthcare to change day-to-day operations in a very human-centric way.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Ballmer retired from Microsoft in 2014 and now spends much of his time running the Los Angeles Clippers, but as if to make the point about the power of a spreadsheet demo, he pulls up one of his own Excel files—a detailed accounting, with hundreds of rows, of how he spends each hour of each workday. The spreadsheet includes the number of hours in a given month spent meeting with players, working on his nonprofits, checking emails, exercising, playing golf, getting massages and on and on.

Not so fast.\n\nWorkday CIO Rani Johnson had the chance to sit down with someone who has been helping organizations navigate one of the biggest technological shifts of our time: Toby Stuart, chair of Workday’s AI Advisory Board and helzel professor, UC Berkeley-Haas. [...] It may be that the most valuable solution for your needs is still on the way. Stuart references Workday’s recent enhancements to the AI Agents suite as an example of how AI technology continues to evolve and solve different problems. “But those didn’t exist last week, at least not on the market.”\n\nThe organizations that win, Stuart believes, will be the ones that adopt AI intentionally, aligning timing and investment with real business value.\n\n## AI Is Redrawing Organizational Maps [...] Johnson emphasized that this pressure to move fast while proving immediate ROI can create unrealistic and burdensome expectations for IT leaders.\n\n&gt; “I think we should remove ROI from the conversation because it’s now apparent to everybody… This is the way the world is migrating. Your job is to build, and prepare the company and the product it makes for the future.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In an environment where retaining top talent hinges on fostering a culture of trust, ensuring fairness in each interaction and review is paramount. AI acts as a transparent, objective partner to managers, making sure the rules of success are clear and applied equally to all.\n\n## Human-Centric, Never Human-Free\n\nAI frees managers from the burdens of manual documentation and subjective assessment, turning them into high-value coaches equipped with objective, personalized, and equitable insights. [...] This shift transforms the manager’s role from evaluator to coach, helping to crystallize growth opportunities delivered when they are most relevant. This investment into personalization directly fuels business performance and value.\n\n### Enabling the Manager-as-Coach\n\nFor HR leaders and managers looking to leverage AI in this transformation, the change is less about the technology and more about the mindset shift it enables. Focus on these three strategic imperatives: [...] Performance systems are inherently vulnerable to human bias. Affinity bias, recency bias, and conscious or unconscious gender bias creep into language and ratings, leading to inconsistency and inequity that can erode the entire employee-manager relationship. Research highlights the risk here: a staggering 85% of employees would consider quitting after receiving what they perceive as an unfair performance assessment.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;As major firms green-light AI for performance reviews, ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As more employers adopt artificial intelligence tools as part of the everyday workflow, AI also is creeping into a key part of employees’ lives: performance reviews.\n\nCompanies that have adopted the technology seek to make the process easier, particularly for managers who might otherwise have to track down disparate bits of information from different sources. \n\nBut it’s not as easy as telling managers and workers that it’s OK to start using ChatGPT. [...] There are also “serious legal and compliance questions that HR leaders cannot afford to ignore,” said Cassat. “While AI promises efficiency and data-driven insights, its use in evaluating employees could subject organizations to discrimination claims as well as substantial compliance obligations.”\n\nThat’s because AI systems learn from historical data, and if past reviews favored people from certain demographics, the algorithms may replicate or even amplify biases. [...] According to the Financial Times, JP Morgan is similarly allowing AI to assist in writing performance reviews. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n### Proper application\n\nAI is already being used for HR-related tasks, according to recent research.\n\nIdeally, employers can guide managers using AI for performance reviews to improve “the problem that typical performance reviews are limited, arbitrary and biased,” said Betsy Summers, principal analyst at Forrester.&quot;,

Its main chatbot, Copilot, runs inside of Excel and promises to make it easy to add more sophisticated calculations to existing spreadsheets. The idea, says Rajesh Jha, the Microsoft executive who oversees Excel (as well as Windows and the other Office apps), is to bring the level of expertise commonly seen at the Excel World Championship to the rest of us. [...] Microsoft used bundling as a competitive strategy, which rivals saw as predatory and unfair. Kapor, the Lotus co-founder, says he didn’t mind the other company’s copying. But “what was painful and difficult were Microsoft’s business practices, which were over the line in many ways,” he says. “I’m hoping that Bill, before he exits the scene, will take more responsibility for that.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How HR has to lead the rise of Agentic AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nearly nine in ten HR professionals using AI in recruiting say it saves time, and more than one in three reports reduced hiring costs2. Agentic AI is already being piloted across HR, finance, technology, and other support functions. We’ve seen AI agents draft onboarding plans, schedule interviews, and even detect early signs of burnout based on behavioral signals. This evolution is well underway. [...] To unlock that value, you need strong foundations, in technology, people, policies, and purpose. Start by aligning HR, IT, legal, and business leaders around one defining question: What kind of collaborator do we want this agent to be?\n\nThis is where the real shift begins. Governance moves from compliance to design. Talent strategies expand to include reskilling programs for AI fluency. Operating models evolve to integrate AI agents at every level, not just as tools, but as contributors. [...] Success tip: Treat AI agents like internal talent. Give them a manager, performance goals, regular reviews, and a clear purpose. The more structure you provide, the more value and trust you’ll unlock.\n\n##### Busting four myths about Agentic AI\n\nUse this as a checklist to assess your readiness. If any myth still feels true, it is time to act.&quot;,
