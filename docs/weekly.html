<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>This week marks a decisive shift from incremental AI augmentation toward platform-scale, agentic intelligence in SaaS ecosystems. Three factors stand out. First, Workday’s Sana acquisition is not simply feature enhancement but a bid to make knowledge-powered agentic AI foundational to operating models, driving value for both organizations and users through contextual, actionable insights. Second, consistent recognition from advisory, analyst, and press sources—whether in the form of third-party awards or leadership quadrants—validates that the operationalization of agentic AI, not just marketing, is what sways enterprise buyers.<br/>
Furthermore, governance has moved to the forefront. EY’s and KPMG’s board-level calls to action are reframing GSIs' consulting pitches from technical implementation to operational resilience and ethical assurance. Bain, meanwhile, underscores that agentic AI is setting a new competitive baseline for ERP transformation—one that not only increases enterprise velocity but also increases expectations for demonstrable business value at every step.<br/>
Cross-vendor momentum is significant: Microsoft’s recognition for Dynamics 365 Copilot, SAP’s advances in AI modularity and data partnerships, and KPMG’s and EY’s GSI playbooks signal the ecosystem is rapidly professionalizing. The implication for Deloitte's Workday team is clear: value, trust, and risk underwrite every client conversation. The week’s pattern is that advisory skill, platform fluency, and the capacity to drive empathic, context-driven AI transformation will separate the top performers from the rest in the coming quarter.</p>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leader in AI-enabled ERP (IDC, 2025-11-04)</a>. Microsoft’s Copilot strategy prioritizes enterprise-wide engagement with agentic AI, upping the ante for competitive user adoption and context-sensitive process automation. For Deloitte, this reinforces the need for cross-platform strength and proof-of-value delivery.</li>
<li><strong>KPMG:</strong> <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/lu/pdf/kpmg_boardroom_considerations_brochure_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C-suite imperatives for agentic AI</a>. New guidance pushes governance and control topics to the top of enterprise transformation agendas. It amplifies the pressure on Deloitte’s teams to provide quantifiable assurance, risk management, and operating models tuned for agentic deployments.</li>
<li><strong>SAP:</strong> Ecosystem partnerships and agentic AI enablement continue to expand SAP’s competitive position, requiring Deloitte practitioners to advise clients on orchestrating best-of-breed hybrid SaaS stacks and harmonizing data for agentic value creation.</li>

Regulatory momentum on AI governance and a greater focus on context, operational alignment, and workforce change signal a new, pragmatic phase of enterprise AI adoption.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Completes Acquisition of Sana (2025-11-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On November 4, 2025, Workday finalized its acquisition of Sana, a move that bolsters its platform’s AI and learning capabilities. Sana, known for its enterprise knowledge management and AI search, enables Workday to integrate a more sophisticated agentic AI backbone, facilitating smart retrieval of knowledge and contextual surfacing of insights within HR and business processes. This signals Workday’s commitment to AI-powered upskilling and personalized learning at scale. For SaaS and HCM competitors, this raises the bar in combining intelligence with workflow; it underlines Workday’s intent to make AI deeply embedded and actionable for its customers, not merely an add-on. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the acquisition opens avenues for advising clients on AI-driven knowledge management and change enablement, positioning Deloitte to lead large-scale digital talent and learning transformations leveraging Workday’s enriched toolset.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-04-Workday-Completes-Acquisition-of-Sana\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Recognized as a 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award Winner (2025-11-05)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s recognition by Inc. as a 2025 Power Partner highlights the trust and business value it delivers for enterprise clients. This acknowledgment is particularly notable in the context of Workday’s AI-driven evolution; the award reflects customer satisfaction not just with core HCM/ERP, but with new AI features, integrations, and the visible pace of platform improvement. For the broader SaaS market, this reinforces the narrative that AI and business value must go hand in hand—a theme echoed in recent analyst coverage. Deloitte’s Workday teams can leverage this recognition as third-party validation in competitive pursuits, client renewals, and co-innovation stories. It is especially relevant for procurement and HR audiences seeking credible, risk-mitigated partners for large-scale transformation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Bain: Agentic AI at the Inflection Point for ERP Transformation (2025-11-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Bain’s latest analysis argues agentic AI is now the chief catalyst for scaling ERP transformation. The report describes how AI agents move beyond basic automation, driving self-orchestration and freeing teams for higher-value work—a key differentiator in platform selection. Bain notes that the competitive field is quickly separating into vendors that provide modular, interoperable agentic AI (such as Workday post-Sana) and those with narrow, point-tool approaches. For Deloitte’s Workday advisors, Bain’s framework brings a sense of urgency: clients will expect proof of real-world agentic outcomes, and even established governance processes must evolve to support new, adaptive AI behaviors. Deloitte practitioners should prioritize frameworks that help clients realize agentic process redesign while controlling risks in global deployment.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.bain.com/insights/is-agentic-ai-the-inflection-point-for-scaling-ERP-transformations\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;EY: AI Governance Is a Top Priority as Agentic Systems Proliferate (2025-11-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;EY’s global guidance spotlights a growing need for strong AI governance as agentic systems become more autonomous in enterprise processes. EY presents practical risk management actions (operational transparency, ongoing impact assessment) for organizations integrating agentic AI into HR and finance workflows. This aligns with Workday’s recent platform investments and efforts to embed governance in AI feature rollouts. For the SaaS market, effective AI governance is not simply a compliance requirement; it is increasingly becoming a core differentiator. Deloitte’s Workday teams should accelerate client conversations on AI accountability models and auditability, leveraging both Workday and Deloitte frameworks.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/financial-services/emeia/what-risk-leaders-need-to-do-now-about-agentic-ai\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft Named a Leader in AI-Enabled ERP by IDC (2025-11-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On November 4, IDC recognized Microsoft as a leader in AI-enabled large-enterprise ERP. Dynamics 365’s agentic AI, deep Copilot integration, and the push for context-aware decision-support underscore the competitive intensity Workday and others face. Notably, Microsoft’s messaging focuses on seamless end-user engagement with AI—mirroring Workday’s own shift. For Deloitte, the Microsoft-Workday contrast is a platform selection discussion for large clients: practitioner fluency in both must be deep, value-driven, and grounded in real customer examples to credibly advise and differentiate.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG: Board-Level Attention on Agentic Corporate Services (Fifth Edition, Nov 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG’s November 2025 agentic corporate services brief signals a boardroom-level shift in how enterprises view agentic AI—not just as a tech project, but as a cross-functional transformation imperative. The guidance outlines the workflow, talent, and control-system redesign needed to fully realize the promise of agentic SaaS. This model of agentic orchestration—linking HCM, finance, and beyond—closely resembles Workday’s long-term vision. Deloitte’s Workday consultants should anticipate executive-level scrutiny and tie proposals to quantifiable business results, governance, and emergent workforce models.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/lu/pdf/kpmg_boardroom_considerations_brochure_2025.pdf\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;CIO.com: Agentic AI Is the Next Big Disruptor (2025-11-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;CIO.com’s investigation into the agentic AI revolution (published November 1, 2025) calls out the transformative disruption about to hit enterprises: self-directed AI agents will reframe how SaaS platforms are built, selected, and governed. Key market signals include: the need for workforce reskilling, change management complexity, and automation amplifying—not replacing—human roles. Workday’s recent moves and public messaging by leading GSIs like Deloitte are tightly aligned to these trends.

Their analysis differentiates between truly modular agentic ecosystems (exemplified by recent Workday moves) and more restrictive automation toolkits. Deloitte teams should adapt their methodologies to highlight agentic process redesign, ensuring clients see measurable value while navigating change risk.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EY: Governance for Agentic AI Systems (2025-11-01):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/financial-services/emeia/what-risk-leaders-need-to-do-now-about-agentic-ai\\\&quot;&gt;EY outlined essential risk management for agentic AI&lt;/a&gt;, calling for transparency, ongoing impact assessment, and operational controls in SaaS HCM/ERP contexts.

This validates approaches Deloitte’s Workday advisors should emphasize in executive discussions.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CIO.com: The Agentic AI Revolution Is Now (2025-11-01):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4085161/the-agentic-ai-revolution-why-your-business-is-about-to-get-disrupted-whether-you-like-it-or-not.html\\\&quot;&gt;CIO.com’s in-depth feature&lt;/a&gt; puts the spotlight on disruptive, self-directed enterprise AI. Best-in-class SaaS adoption increasingly requires change management and human-centered enablement—both core to Deloitte’s value add.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;What changed this week&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This week marks a decisive shift from incremental AI augmentation toward platform-scale, agentic intelligence in SaaS ecosystems. Three factors stand out. First, Workday’s Sana acquisition is not simply feature enhancement but a bid to make knowledge-powered agentic AI foundational to operating models, driving value for both organizations and users through contextual, actionable insights. Second, consistent recognition from advisory, analyst, and press sources—whether in the form of third-party awards or leadership quadrants—validates that the operationalization of agentic AI, not just marketing, is what sways enterprise buyers.&lt;br/&gt;\\nFurthermore, governance has moved to the forefront. EY’s and KPMG’s board-level calls to action are reframing GSIs&#x27; consulting pitches from technical implementation to operational resilience and ethical assurance. Bain, meanwhile, underscores that agentic AI is setting a new competitive baseline for ERP transformation—one that not only increases enterprise velocity but also increases expectations for demonstrable business value at every step.&lt;br/&gt;\\nCross-vendor momentum is significant: Microsoft’s recognition for Dynamics 365 Copilot, SAP’s advances in AI modularity and data partnerships, and KPMG’s and EY’s GSI playbooks signal the ecosystem is rapidly professionalizing. The implication for Deloitte&#x27;s Workday team is clear: value, trust, and risk underwrite every client conversation.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Most enterprise SaaS companies are adding agentic AI capabilities to their platforms. HR agents guide managers through performance reviews, supply chain agents can take action during global disruptions, and employee experience agents handle meeting follow-ups.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;HUMAIN and EY MENA announce ambition to redefine AI- ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Around the world, agentic AI is being recognized as one of the most important frontiers of investment in artificial intelligence. Businesses and governments are moving beyond static chatbots and SaaS systems toward intelligent, autonomous agents that can execute complex, multi-step processes, collaborate across systems, and adapt in real-time. From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, from regulators in Europe to fast-growing enterprises in Asia, the conversation has shifted: AI agents are no longer [...] theoretical, they are becoming the foundation of the next era of business transformation. For investors, enterprises, and governments alike, agentic AI represents one of the most significant opportunities to unlock productivity, reduce costs, and deliver innovation at scale. Analysts project agentic AI to become a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity by 2030, underscoring why AI offerings from HUMAIN and EY are at the center of global investment and innovation strategies. [...] The global EY organization is uniquely positioned to support accelerating this shift. With a client base that spans Fortune 500s, governments, and innovators, and a service breadth from EY-Parthenon strategy to audit, tax, and consulting, EY has been among the fastest movers in re-imagining its service model with AI. Its proprietary datasets, proven business platforms, and AI investments across the globe are now being activated through HUMAIN ONE’s agentic AI architecture.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The next-generation data and technology function is rapidly evolving into a strategic orchestrator of autonomous systems, human-machine teams and intelligent workflows. This is driven by the emergence of agentic AI — autonomous agents that can plan and execute complex, multi-step workflows with a different type of human involvement. This represents a paradigm shift beyond simple automation. \n\nThis new reality necessitates key changes within your data and technology teams: [...] ### Adopt a strategic mindset towards AI, just like you do with other technologies\n\nIn today’s rapidly evolving landscape, several key drivers are reshaping the functions that data and technology executives are leading. Generative and agentic AI stand at the forefront, revolutionizing how organizations approach problem-solving and innovation, and therefore the expectations of your data and technology functions’ role in enabling that future. [...] It’s essential to approach AI as an integral part of enterprise technology strategy planning. Define and link to the desired business value strategically, rather than getting lost in isolated use cases — “use case bingo”. This involves both a top-down assessment of business capabilities and a roadmap for how AI will transform them over time.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One of the biggest questions still to be decided is who will control the orchestration layer. Platform providers are positioning themselves as the central hub, offering interoperability on paper but nudging customers toward proprietary ecosystems. [...] Second, the longer an organization delays, the greater the possibility of vendor lock-in. As platforms evolve into orchestration hubs controlling both the agents and their interconnections, switching becomes harder. Enterprises that fail to build their own “AI muscle” risk becoming passive consumers of someone else’s automation. [...] Agentic tools give organizations the ability to deploy packaged agents and develop custom ones. Yet in practice, five main roadblocks mean many companies remain stuck at the pilot stage. First, organizational challenges include unclear operating models for human-agent interaction and limited internal skills. On the technical side, most agentic tooling is still immature, with orchestration frameworks and customization options only recently emerging.&quot;,

A simple way to estimate return on investment (ROI) is to subtract the total costs from the total benefits and then divide by the total costs. This will give you a percentage that represents your ROI.\n\nBeyond immediate financial gains, consider the long-term strategic value of implementing a CRM system, such as staying competitive, adapting to market changes more quickly, and building a more resilient business. [...] Look at how well the CRM system integrates with other tools you already use, such as email marketing services, social media platforms, and accounting software. Seamless integration reduces complexity and boosts productivity.\n\nThe ease of use of the CRM system is crucial, especially for small to medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources to train staff extensively. A user-friendly interface ensures higher adoption rates. [...] Workflow automation in CRM refers to the use of software tools to streamline and automate routine business processes within customer relationship management to enhance efficiency and improve customer service. By automating repetitive tasks and workflows, CRM systems alleviate the workload on employees and reduce the chances of human error. This feature streamlines business processes and ensures that important tasks are completed on time.\n\n### Reporting and analytics&quot;,

The application exhibited distinct usage patterns, with peak activity occurring at the start of the workday when users began logging in. [...] ONE®, Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) , helps its customers secure and manage all devices that connect to a network, both on premises and in the cloud. Omnissa Horizon® provides solutions for virtual desktops and apps, digital employee experience, and robust security—all underpinned by AI-driven automation. [...] Automate database administrative tasks: With RDS for SQL Server, Omnissa could automate time-consuming database administrative tasks, such as push-button scaling, automated provisioning, automated patching, and built-in high availability and disaster recovery (HADR) capabilities. Omnissa would also be able to natively integrate with AWS AI/ML services.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The company said it’s also expanding the Developer Copilot, its conversational AI codeveloper that allows developers to work faster, with Workday Extend, a low-code no-code tool that allows users to quickly take ideas from alpha mode to deployment. [...] Grippo said using Extend has been a powerful tool for nontechnical workers to bring ideas to life that otherwise they would not be able to create. By combining it with Copilot, it will combine the best of both worlds, helping bridge the gap between the highly technical and those with less coding experience who are just throwing together more simple applications. [...] Announced during the company’s annual developer conference Workday DevCon 2025 in Las Vegas, the new toolset includes an Agent Gateway that will provide connectors for third-party AI agents and for agent-to-agent collaboration, AI widgets and expanded application programming interfaces for native integration into AI apps.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Building a pragmatic framework for scalable and trusted AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Oracle’s quarterly updates mean the tools keep advancing. Leaders should evolve business processes in step to ensure their enterprise is never left behind.\n\n## Beyond today’s agent pilots\n\nAI agents aren’t the finish line — they’re the starting point for a more profound shift on how work will get done. Today, they streamline tasks and sharpen decisions. Tomorrow, they’ll reshape how functions like finance, HR and procurement are designed, overlaying human judgment onto machine precision. [...] That’s how a US-based gaming and entertainment company gained momentum. The company’s AI steering committee was energized about the potential of AI agents, but those who were less advanced in their understanding of the technology remained skeptical. KPMG teams worked with the company to pilot two targeted use cases: one to answer procurement policy queries and the other to flag anomalies in payables. [...] Bias, security gaps and misaligned decisions are real risks. Responsible use policies, monitoring frameworks and transparency protocols build trust in both the technology and its outcomes.\n ###### Move in sprints\n\n  Incremental rollouts with human checkpoints make progress tangible, mitigate risks and build confidence at each stage.\n ###### Co-evolve with the platform&quot;,

Work with your IT team to (1) understand in-house agentic AI technologies or potential technologies worth acquiring and (2) develop effective AI models. Data preparation is crucial — AI agents need clean, consistent, accurate, relevant data. [...] For example, you could kick off a payroll audit by querying a generative AI tool with a prompt like, “I’m preparing to audit the payroll process. I want to understand the types of things that can go wrong in the payroll process.” After the AI lists possible risks, you can iterate with different prompts to refine your list. From there, you can ask about typical controls associated with each risk, test procedures for each control, and required documentation to support test steps. You can even ask [...] AI agents can be quite sophisticated. Potential use cases are highly compelling: autonomous continuous risk monitoring, risk assessments, compliance checks, fraud detection, real-time decisions on prioritization or audit approaches (based on predefined parameters), scenario simulations, audit report generation, resource management, and stakeholder reporting.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“I am 100% convinced — whether Humain does it, Google does it, Apple does it —  this is the future UX,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said at the FII9 conference last month in Riyadh. (He was part of a fireside chat alongside Alphabet President Ruth Porat and Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia.)\n\n“We will get into a world where AI agents are integrated into one platform,” Amin said. “They are directly integrated with your enterprise system processes.” [...] ### Intel’s Panther Lake chip could allow Windows 11 to morph into an agentic OS — analysts\n\n  Oct 22, 2025 5 mins\n news analysis\n\n  ### Voice AI issues – the clunky speech, weird pauses and inaccuracies — are being fixed, execs say\n\n  Oct 16, 2025 3 mins\n news analysis\n\n  ### GenAI agents are changing language translation in the enterprise\n\n  Oct 14, 2025 5 mins\n news analysis\n\n  ### DevRev’s AI agent hangout targets worker productivity, data integration\n\n  Oct 7, 2025 4 mins [...] With AI agents making it possible to realize value in enterprises, it’s time to take advantage of that technology for tasks such as HR and finance, Amin said. “With advanced models that Google has done, OpenAI has done, I pondered why the interfaces on mobile computers never changed,” Amin said.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Christian Kleinerman, EVP of product at Snowflake, added, “The opportunity now is to unlock the data’s full potential by combining it with all your other enterprise data.

These segments should include: [...] Most enterprise SaaS companies are adding agentic AI capabilities to their platforms.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The most effective organizations use a “three lines of defense” model: the first line builds and operates responsibly, the second reviews and governs, and the third provides periodic assessment and audit. That structure allows companies to move quickly while still maintaining confidence and control.\n\nHow are AI technologies, especially AI agents, reshaping Responsible AI? [...] We’re also seeing a shift in focus. Organizations aren’t just signing up to RAI principles, they’re asking how to make them real as the volume of AI deployments increases and agent deployments become reality. Half of respondents told us their biggest hurdle is turning those principles into practice by scaling and automating governance, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and aligning leadership around a consistent approach.\n\nWhat&#x27;s holding companies back from scaling Responsible AI?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As organizations establish their AI operating models, IT’s role cannot be confined to a control function. Instead, it must work in tandem with the business and people leaders, including your talent/HR teams, to bring innovative ideas to the table and serve as a catalyst for innovation, all while balancing speed of adoption and availability of skillsets. [...] They’ll need to incorporate new talent archetypes like Prompt Engineers, who translate human intent into machine instructions, and MLOps / AIOps roles, who manage the lifecycle of AI assets in production. To access these skillsets means partnering with HR teams to ensure role profiles and job architectures are kept modernized to attract the right talent, along with thoughtful use of vendors and service providers to access the talent needed. [...] Organizations must adopt a strategic mindset towards AI, transitioning from tech-enabled to tech-triggered transformations. This shift emphasizes AI as a catalyst for innovation and new business models. Data and technology leaders are tasked with navigating complexities, focusing on productivity, and driving new revenue streams. As the vendor ecosystem evolves, IT departments must collaborate with business leaders to establish robust AI operating models, ensuring agility and cross-functional&quot;,

Their work includes defining which datasets are allowed for which purposes, monitoring for bias, and enforcing clear rules on how [...] That democratization of AI, where nontechnical employees create agents that embody their own workflow intelligence, has become a cultural turning point. “Once people realize they can build something that helps them and their whole team, adoption takes care of itself,” Levy explains. The result is a workplace where humans and agents collaborate continuously, each learning from the other. “AI doesn’t replace our people,” he says. “It scales their impact.” [...] ## Topics\n\n Analytics\n Artificial Intelligence\n Generative AI\n Business Operations\n Careers\n Cloud Computing\n Data Center\n Data Management\n Emerging Technology\n Enterprise Applications\n Industry\n IT Leadership\n Digital Transformation\n IT Strategy\n IT Management\n Innovation\n Diversity and Inclusion\n IT Operations\n Project Management\n Networking\n Security\n Software Development\n Vendors and Providers\n Enterprise Buyer’s Guides\n\n## About&quot;,

For instance, in your payroll audit, maybe you’d like to understand certain data patterns or anomalies that may indicate payroll fraud and noncompliance (e.g., overpayments/underpayments, unusual deductions). You could ask the AI to suggest predictive analytics methods for using relevant historical data (e.g., average salaries based on position, payroll budgets) to predict and forecast future payroll trends, which can help identify outliers. [...] For example, you could kick off a payroll audit by querying a generative AI tool with a prompt like, “I’m preparing to audit the payroll process. I want to understand the types of things that can go wrong in the payroll process.” After the AI lists possible risks, you can iterate with different prompts to refine your list. From there, you can ask about typical controls associated with each risk, test procedures for each control, and required documentation to support test steps. You can even ask [...] Fortunately, as outlined in previous use cases, generative AI tools excel at tasks that require comparing and synthesizing information across multiple disparate information sources, making them a great fit for project staffing. For example, in AuditBoard AI’s intelligent staffing feature, managers define which skills and qualifications are important, add them to team members’ profiles, and indicate which skills and qualifications are needed for each new project.

The broader function, let alone the enterprise, didn’t fundamentally change. [...] The impact was immediate.

We help break it down, so clients can take the first steps. The key is not to be apprehensive. Instead, start small, lean on trusted advisors and build momentum from there.\n\nNick Yoko [...] Executives today want (and need) more.

Integrating AI-driven security capabilities within cloud environments can help you take a more agile [...] Addressing the challenges of secure AI demands a holistic strategy that combines advanced technical controls with strong governance frameworks.

These contributions, though undeniably [...] helpful, highlight a persistent gap between AI’s transformative potential and tangible, widespread organizational impact.

Various roles can now be filled by agentic AI, with swarms of AI agents working alongside humans as digital co-workers that can perform and execute processes like managing payroll data.5Workday, for example, announced earlier this year its launch of an Agent System of Record, a marketplace that acts as a workforce management system for digital employees. It provides one platform to onboard new AI agents; [...] This means broadening the way we think about talent. Workers with transferable skills or unconventional backgrounds could bring fresh perspectives to the table. Collaboration across teams and even external partnerships can open up new possibilities.

If up to 95% of AI projects are going to fail across a portfolio then failure isn’t a risk, it’s almost a certainty. The risk is in allowing those projects to carry on when they could have been stopped earlier. Therefore the goal should be to fail on purpose, early and cheaply.By failing early and cheaply, you [...] Instead, we’ve helped organisations adopt a Deployed AI Team model: where the centralised AI group temporarily embed smaller sub-teams in business units for use-case specific solution development. \n\nWhen this works well, it unlocks: \n\nBut challenges can occur with this model when business users don’t feel ownership of the project.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Strategic approach: Key to AI transformation&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;True value and differentiation can be achieved when AI deployment is directly derived from corporate strategy and treated as a holistic transformation effort. At the same time, organisations must have a realistic view on how such transformations unfold: progress is not linear but also not random. The key is to actively manage individual phases — consciously tolerating temporary productivity declines and higher investment needs. Through clear strategic priorities, visible quick wins, and the [...] AI is being driven by major technology companies, investing billions of dollars into the new technologies, and AI consequently continues to evolve rapidly. After large language models (LLMs), the next evolutionary stage, Agentic AI, is already on the horizon. Companies have to rethink their approach and their business strategies, and ask the right questions to successfully integrate AI into their core value creation processes. [...] To reach a higher level of AI maturity, organisations must be willing to tolerate productivity losses in the short-to-medium term and invest deliberately in AI foundations. Those who accept this “pain of change” as a necessary part of evolution will be well-prepared for broader AI adoption and will position themselves favorably on the exponentially rising value curve (see Figure 1 – Deloitte J-Curve in AI Transformations).\n\n Share\n\nSkip to description)&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A grocery retailer evaluating a protein-packed frozen meal promotion doesn’t have to rely on guesswork. With advances in AI, “synthetic customers” can provide reliable proxies on how real people shop—and explain their decisions in clear, conversational terms. [...] These aren’t static dashboards. They’re AI agents you can engage directly—designed to simulate how real customers think, choose, and change.\n\nExecutives can ask questions like: Would this discount increase a shopper’s basket size? Could swapping this product trigger unexpected churn? Where should I launch this new product? And instead of just outputting probabilities, synthetic customers can respond with AI-enabled logic in natural language, linking expected behaviors to motivations. [...] For example, in response to the promotion detailed above, a persona modeled on a millennial GLP-1 user might say: “At that price, I’d buy three meals and freeze them,” an indication of the pantry effect. Another, representing Gen Z parents, might push back: “My kids won’t eat the store brand—the discount doesn’t matter,” potentially leaving the brand or the category.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;She cites examples of companies that encourage employees to train AI models and learn prompt engineering, noting that this approach effectively removes the mystery surrounding AI and demonstrates its inner workings. Workday is adopting a similar strategy, encouraging employees to explore third-party AI tools, learn prompt writing, and train chatbots. The goal is to position AI as a true copilot, an intelligent assistant that empowers employees to perform their jobs more effectively. [...] At Workday, our journey with AI has been one of continuous learning and adaptation. We&#x27;ve embraced its power to drive innovation and, most importantly, to make work more meaningful for everyone. We believe that our experiences and strategies can provide valuable guidance for other leaders as they navigate the complexities of the AI landscape. [...] Building an AI-first culture requires a multifaceted approach. To summarize the key takeaways:\n\n Start by building awareness and excitement around AI.\n Identify relevant use cases and invest strategically.\n Foster a culture of learning and experimentation, encouraging employees at all levels to explore and understand AI tools.&quot;,

Her approach puts AI directly into the hands of employees, creating space for experimentation, learning, and real impact. [...] Johnson believes that AI won’t always follow the old ROI playbook. Her team created an AI advisory council to replace rigid review processes with an open-minded approach to leadership.\n\n“Even projects without immediate, quantifiable ROI can still produce amazing results,” Johnson said.\n\nOne example: Workday’s investor relations team developed a new AI-driven report in just weeks with minimal resources. It didn’t just save time, it changed how they planned.\n\nLet IT Lead with Openness&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;READ:  Opposite of FIRMLY - 35 Antonyms With Sentence Examples\n\nFinal Thoughts about Antonyms of HATE [...] Skip to content\n\nApplied Grammar by Gail Brubaker\n\n# Opposite of HATE – 35 Antonyms With Sentence Examples\n\nby Gail-Brubaker\n\nWhen exploring language, it is essential to understand antonyms. Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings from one another. They provide balance and contrast in written and spoken communication. By knowing antonyms for common words like hate, we can better express ourselves and convey nuanced emotions effectively. [...] By practicing empathy, forgiveness, and appreciation, we can overcome hate and create a more compassionate world. Choosing to replace negative emotions with their antonyms empowers us to see the good in others, build bridges instead of walls, and promote a culture of respect and unity. Embracing love and understanding enables us to break free from the cycle of hostility and build a brighter and more peaceful future for ourselves and those around us.\n\n### Related&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Insights from Jennifer Kosar, PwC&#x27;s US AI Assurance Leader&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The most effective organizations use a “three lines of defense” model: the first line builds and operates responsibly, the second reviews and governs, and the third provides periodic assessment and audit. That structure allows companies to move quickly while still maintaining confidence and control.\n\nHow are AI technologies, especially AI agents, reshaping Responsible AI? [...] Jennifer Kosar:The next big shift is already underway. The majority of leaders surveyed expect AI agents to reshape governance within the next year – both as a challenge and an opportunity. As systems become more autonomous, organizations are adapting oversight frameworks to include built-in testing, real-time monitoring, and automated controls. [...] We’re also seeing a shift in focus. Organizations aren’t just signing up to RAI principles, they’re asking how to make them real as the volume of AI deployments increases and agent deployments become reality. Half of respondents told us their biggest hurdle is turning those principles into practice by scaling and automating governance, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and aligning leadership around a consistent approach.\n\nWhat&#x27;s holding companies back from scaling Responsible AI?&quot;,
