  <li><strong>Workday Recognized as Cloud ERP Leader (Gartner Magic Quadrant, 2025-10-15):</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-15-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-2025-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Cloud-ERP-for-Service-Centric-Enterprises-for-Fourth-Consecutive-Year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br/>Workday has reasserted its position as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises, marking its fourth year at the pinnacle. This honor highlights Workday’s relentless drive in fusing agentic AI and advanced ML into its platform, which underpins HR and finance transformation for a broad customer base. For Deloitte, this validation strengthens our client-side recommendations and substantiates the business case for Workday-led AI transformation, mitigating vendor concerns during multi-cloud tenders.</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle, AWS, UKG, and SAP Escalate Agentic AI Competition (Oct 14–17, 2025):</strong> <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510150810PR_NEWS_USPRX____SF98320-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle details</a> | <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/10/aws-quick-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS details</a> | <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UKG details</a> | <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/joule-in-sap-successfactors-4de4e7fb29434079ae07dffc93b64639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Joule</a><br/>This week ushered in substantial innovation: Oracle’s new Fusion agent marketplace and Autonomous AI Lakehouse bolster modular agent development, AWS debuts its agentic AI-native Quick Suite, UKG expands real-time AI HR automation via Bryte, and SAP broadens Joule agent adoptions. These advances reinforce era-defining trends: multi-agent, marketplace-driven SaaS, and deep cloud-native orchestration. For Deloitte, client conversations now require nuanced, insight-led advice on agent architecture, data strategy, and platform integration.</li>
  <li><strong>KPMG, Deloitte, EY Drive Agentic AI Drills and Governance (2025-10-14…10-17):</strong> <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2025/10/agentic-ai-advantage-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPMG report</a> | <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/articles/agentic-ai-orchestration-governance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte best practices</a><br/>This week saw KPMG spotlight business value through interconnected agent models, EY set the tone on responsible multi-agent design, and Deloitte formalize orchestration guidelines within regulated SaaS. Deloitte’s delivery needs to embrace these reference architectures and frameworks—especially in regulated and global settings—to sustain trust and differentiated value in Workday transformations.</li>
  <li><strong>Workday’s Higher Education Momentum and Illuminate AI Agents Expansion (2025-10-15):</strong> <a href="https://investor.workday.com/2025-10-15-Workdays-Higher-Education-Momentum-Accelerates-as-Over-650-Institutions-Worldwide-Turn-to-AI-to-Navigate-Uncertainty-and-Transform-the-Student-Experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday press release</a><br/>With over 650 Higher Ed institutions adopting Workday’s AI portfolio, Illuminate AI agents are now proven in complex, process-sensitive environments. For Deloitte’s sector practices, this is a scalable reference model accelerating transformation programs, with agentic AI use cases at the core.</li>
  <li><strong>Patterns Emergent: Multi-Agent Marketplaces, Orchestration, and Responsible AI:</strong> <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/articles/agentic-ai-orchestration-governance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte agentic AI governance</a><br/>The agentic shift is visible across SaaS: agent marketplaces (Workday, Oracle), orchestration-first architectures (AWS, SAP), and modular extensibility. Analyst and GSI commentary reinforce that the winning playbook for consulting now demands multi-agent orchestration skills plus embedded AI risk frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>The SaaS ecosystem for agentic AI entered a new competitive phase as Workday earned consecutive Gartner leader status, Oracle launched a comprehensive agent marketplace with open agentic capabilities, AWS furthered native agentic suites, and UKG & SAP rapidly matured their own agent frameworks. Integration, extensibility, and trust frameworks have become table stakes, while modularity and orchestration drive procurement and architectural decisions. Analyst and GSI perspectives this week remained in strong alignment—value creation in SaaS now hinges on client orchestration of interoperable agents, underpinned by rigorous risk and governance protocols.<br/>For Deloitte, these changes require transformation of sales narratives, enablement, and delivery models, foregrounding agent comparison, ecosystem architecture, and responsible AI consulting. The window for advisory differentiation will tighten as vendor solutions converge and commoditize—expertise in governance and multi-vendor orchestration will separate market leaders.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510150810PR_NEWS_USPRX____SF98320-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle expands agents and open marketplace</a>. Oracle’s push targets complex enterprises with modular, extensible AI and quick onboarding for ISV partners; for Deloitte and Workday, be prepared to address ‘suite consolidation’ vs. best-of-breed debates for clients and ensure orchestration is tightly governed and value-focused.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS:</strong> <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/10/aws-quick-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Quick Suite launch</a> demonstrates what cloud-native, agentic extensibility could mean for procurement, scalability, and innovation speed; Deloitte should leverage Workday’s own agent framework and integration cloud as counterpoints, and provide robust guidance for multi-cloud clients.</li>
  <li><strong>UKG:</strong> <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryte AI agents launch</a> intensifies competitive claims on automation and experience—Deloitte’s Workday advisory can win by translating technical agent innovation into onboarding, reskilling, and governance outcomes with clear client value.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP:</strong> <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/joule-in-sap-successfactors-4de4e7fb29434079ae07dffc93b64639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joule digital agent ramp-up</a> requires Deloitte’s Workday teams to offer nuanced, use-case-centric agent core comparisons to help large clients rationalize and optimize investments.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Multi-Vendor AI Agent Ecosystems:</strong> <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2025/10/agentic-ai-advantage-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPMG Agentic AI Advantage</a>—deepens ability to map and contrast features and value of top agent frameworks.</li>
  <li><strong>Workday Illuminate™ & Industry AI Agents:</strong> <a href="https://investor.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Illuminate-TM-Expands-with-New-AI-Agents-for-HR,-Finance,-and-Industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminate Program Expansion</a>—practitioners accelerate client rollouts and sectoral solutioning from proven templates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Leverage new Gartner Magic Quadrant recognition to drive client confidence and mitigate competitive FUD in live pursuits.</li>
  <li>Mobilize sector teams on Workday Illuminate™ agent value and develop process redesign case studies for verticals such as education.</li>
  <li>Bring together solution and architecture leads for cross-vendor agent framework comparison sessions and partner playbook updates.</li>
  <li>Infuse best practices in responsible agent orchestration, leveraging latest GSI whitepapers and frameworks.</li>
  <li>Activate ISV/joint solutioning tracks with focus on agent extensibility and orchestration integrations in large deals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Marketplace confusion and complexity among clients due to aggressive agentic SaaS competition.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Lead clear, business-value-led agent strategy workshops and actively recommend tailored architectures grounded in client needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Governance and compliance risks from fragmented or poorly orchestrated agent deployments.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Integrate leading GSI frameworks and deploy continuous governance at both pilot and scaled production phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Evolving delivery skillset gaps relating to orchestration and multi-agent, multi-cloud environments.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Launch structured enablement and cross-training spanning top platforms aligned to key client verticals.</li>

The agentic AI battleground is drawing sharper lines, while ecosystem partnerships, scalable agent frameworks, and enterprise trust imperatives take center stage for Deloitte and its clients.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Recognized as Cloud ERP Leader (Gartner Magic Quadrant, 2025-10-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On October 15, 2025, Workday was recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises for the fourth consecutive year. The evaluation highlights Workday’s continued innovation and execution in cloud ERP, particularly its integration of agentic AI and machine learning capabilities for finance and HR transformation. Workday’s ability to scale AI use cases—ranging from generative agents in talent management to orchestration across data clouds—cements its role as a trusted anchor in SaaS for AI-enabled enterprise operations. This reaffirms Workday’s partner-first, scalable AI future and positions Deloitte to amplify value as an SI and innovation advisor in AI-enabled ERP transformation programs.\\n\\nThe recognition also signals to clients and competitors that Workday’s platform vision and AI/agentic ecosystem provide credibility, referenceability, and competitive insulation. Deloitte’s solution differentiation can be sharpened by this recognition, leveraging independent validation to support new business development and client trust around change management, platform integration, and responsible AI adoption.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-15-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-2025-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Cloud-ERP-for-Service-Centric-Enterprises-for-Fourth-Consecutive-Year\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle, AWS, UKG, and SAP Escalate Agentic AI Competition (Oct 14–17, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Competitors made marked moves this week. Oracle introduced its Autonomous AI Lakehouse and expanded the Fusion Applications AI Agent Marketplace, pushing modular plug-and-play agent development and democratizing access for ISVs and customers. AWS launched Amazon Quick Suite, an agentic-AI native business suite, promising cross-application orchestration and data-driven automation. UKG unveiled new Bryte AI Agents for employee experience, emphasizing real-time, conversational HR automations. SAP highlighted ongoing adoption and guidance for Joule, its adaptive HR AI digital assistant.\\n\\nThese advances place agent-centric ecosystems at the heart of cloud SaaS/HCM, upping competitive pressure for rapid innovation. With deep integration between agent orchestration, modularity, and data fabric capabilities, Deloitte’s Workday practice must help clients navigate coexistence, platform migrations, and maximization of existing investments while embedding responsible and scalable AI practices.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510150810PR_NEWS_USPRX____SF98320-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG, Deloitte, EY Drive Agentic AI Drills and Governance (2025-10-14…10-17)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG released a new report on agentic AI, spotlighting next-level value in SaaS through interconnected, autonomous agents. EY delivered best practices in responsible multi-agent systems at its AI Week, directly addressing complex orchestration and ethical guardrails. Deloitte advanced thought leadership in agentic governance and orchestration, emphasizing risk management frameworks and the need for trusted, modular, cross-vendor agent designs. These insights show GSIs are increasingly shaping the reference architecture and operational guidance for AI agents in SaaS.\\n\\nFor Deloitte&#x27;s Workday-centric practice, this means consulting value is rapidly moving from feature enablement to stewardship of multi-agent systems, data flows, and responsible AI. The strategic differentiator lies in marshaling these best practices into client roadmaps, especially for regulated industries and at-scale deployments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2025/10/agentic-ai-advantage-report.pdf\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s Higher Education Momentum and Illuminate AI Agents Expansion (2025-10-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On October 15, Workday reported that over 650 higher education institutions globally are now leveraging its AI-powered solutions to enhance agility amid uncertainty. Simultaneously, Workday’s Illuminate™ program continues to roll out industry-specific agents for HR and Finance. Education sector clients cite accelerated talent management, predictive student success, and scalable process automation as core wins. For Deloitte, this opens up sector-specific consulting opportunities—using Workday’s out-of-the-box agents as springboards for tailored experiences, compliance alignment, and organizational change initiatives.\\n\\nThe higher education case further signals the mainstreaming of AI agents beyond leading commercial clients, expanding the addressable market for Deloitte&#x27;s advisory and deployment offerings.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://investor.workday.com/2025-10-15-Workdays-Higher-Education-Momentum-Accelerates-as-Over-650-Institutions-Worldwide-Turn-to-AI-to-Navigate-Uncertainty-and-Transform-the-Student-Experience\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Patterns Emergent: Multi-Agent Marketplaces, Orchestration, and Responsible AI (Oct 12–19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A shared pattern is visible across vendors: agent marketplaces (Workday, Oracle), modular agent orchestration (AWS Quick Suite, SAP Joule), and ecosystem openness (autonomous lakehouses, partner networks) as competitive levers. Equally, top GSIs and advisors are elevating the conversation around responsible design, risk frameworks, and governance at both codebase and orchestration levels. These twin trends validate the necessity for integrated, plug-and-play approaches to agent deployment coupled with robust governance and data flow visibility—areas where Deloitte can add unique value.\\n\\nClients will increasingly seek Deloitte’s advisory for not just technical rollout but for business process re-design, agent interoperability, and ongoing compliance management of these complex AI ecosystems.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/articles/agentic-ai-orchestration-governance.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched Autonomous AI Lakehouse and expanded Fusion Applications AI Agent Marketplace (Oct. 14, 2025).

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;[JR]: How do you ensure your AI agents are compliant, secure, and scalable for enterprise customers?\n\n[AR]: As we were developing our first AI agents, we built dedicated observability for it. This led to a dedicated product solution for AI observability, helping us understand and debug behavior, insights into cost, performance and quality as well as evaluating guardrails to understand where agents do not work properly. [...] [AR]: Everything starts with the use case. When we think about the customer’s needs, we usually define the level of autonomy from assisting, to advising and eventually delegating the goal to an AI agent. So, everything starts there. Then, we analyze what a human will need to perform the task and which tools are required. We use this knowledge to help with fine tuning our specific data queries. Tools will become software services exposed via Microsoft Cloud Framework (MCF). [...] Now, our Davis AI engine is at the core of our platform. It features the unique combination of causal, predictive, and generative AI to help businesses identify and address issues before they affect users, allowing them to spend more time innovating and less time firefighting. Our platform also helps organizations monitor, optimize, and secure generative AI applications, LLMs, and agentic workflows, which boosts performance, explainability, and compliance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The limited centralized oversight in multi-agent systems raises questions about the extent of human control over autonomous agents. This lack of oversight can lead to ethical dilemmas and unintended consequences, making it essential for organizations to establish governance frameworks that balance autonomy with necessary human intervention.\n ## [...] Autonomy captures the degree to which an agent can act and make decisions independently. Highly autonomous agents can sense their environment, evaluate options and act with minimal human intervention, driving efficiency and responsiveness at scale. However, this independence heightens the need for robust oversight, ethical safeguards and accountability frameworks. At the other end of the spectrum, low-autonomy agents are capable of executing basic, repetitive tasks but depend heavily on humans [...] ◦ High autonomy: Minimal human involvement, enabling scalability but requiring strong governance. ◦ Low autonomy: Limited independence, relying on frequent human direction.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentforce IT Service: Helps reduce IT costs and boost employee productivity by ending the portal-to-ticket era and deploying specialized AI agents to deliver 24/7 conversational resolutions everywhere employees work, including Slack and Microsoft Teams. Customers can benefit from 100+ pre-built connectors, integrations, and workflows from partners including Box, CrowdStrike, Google, IBM, Okta, Oracle Netsuite, Workday, and Zoom. [...] Slack-native AgentExchange: Turns Slack into the premier marketplace for AI agents.Building on the hundreds of partner-built actions and MCP servers that extend Agentforce agents, teams can now discover, try, and install agents and apps from partners like Anthropic (Claude), Cursor, Google Cloud, OpenAI (ChatGPT, Codex), Perplexity, Vercel, and WRITER — all natively within their Slack workspace. [...] The Agentic Enterprise represents a new model for work — where AI elevates people rather than replacing them. In an Agentic Enterprise, every team operates with 24/7 intelligence: sales leads are never missed, service never sleeps, and every employee has an AI partner that helps them move faster and make smarter decisions. The result is a new era of productivity, customer connection, and growth.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic system: An agentic system is a type of software or AI that perceives its environment, decides that are based on that perception, and takes actions to achieve specific goals, often with\n  minimal human intervention. An agentic system can learn, adapt, and operate independently to solve problems or perform tasks.\n AI agent: On the ServiceNow AI Platform agentic system, an AI agent contains a set of large language model (LLM) instructions with the tools to perform these specific tasks. [...] The base system agentic workflows remain read only. You must duplicate them to use them. For more information about cloning an agentic workflow, see Clone an agentic workflow. You can modify the duplicated base system agentic workflow to meet your requirements. For more information, see Modify an agentic workflow. You must activate the base system agentic workflows before they can be used. For more information about activating an agentic workflow, see agentic workflow template. [...] The AI Agent Orchestrator in the agentic framework is a coordinator entity that handles collaboration across multiple agents by routing requests from one agent to other agents to help accomplish a complex task. The AI Agent\nOrchestrator can also reach out to one of the agents involved in the task accomplishment to get the missing context or information from the user for task completion.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conversely, a gen AI approach may not be ideal in the following situations:\n\n The task is highly deterministic and can be effectively solved with pre-defined templates or rule-based systems.\n The entire set of required information is already static or fits within a simple, closed framework.\n Extremely low-latency (millisecond) responses are required, and the overhead of generative processing cannot be accommodated.\n Simple, templated responses are sufficient for the intended use case. [...] In this stage, you transform your solution design into a working gen AI application. Rather than perfecting everything upfront, start small with a minimal proof-of-concept (POC) that can be tested quickly. This lets you deploy to a pre-production environment as soon as possible, gather representative queries from actual users or SMEs, and refine based on real-world feedback.\n\nThe build process follows these key steps: [...] Note that these capabilities work even if your gen AI app runs outside Databricks. By instrumenting your code with MLflow Tracing, you can capture traces from any environment and unify them in the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform for consistent evaluation and monitoring. As you continue to incorporate new queries, feedback, and SME insights, your evaluation dataset becomes a living resource that underpins a continuous improvement cycle, ensuring your gen AI app stays robust, reliable, and&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In collaboration with the private and public sectors, NIST has developed a framework to better manage risks to individuals, organizations, and society associated with artificial intelligence (AI). The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. [...] A companion NIST AI RMF Playbook also has been published by NIST along with an AI RMF Roadmap \&quot;), AI RMF Crosswalk \&quot;), and various Perspectives.\n\nOn March 30, 2023, NIST launched the Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center, which will facilitate implementation of, and international alignment with, the AI RMF. Examples of how other organizations are building on and using the AI RMF can be found via the AIRC’s Use Case page. [...] On July 26, 2024, NIST released NIST-AI-600-1, Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile. The profile  can help organizations identify unique risks posed by generative AI and proposes actions for generative AI risk management that best aligns with their goals and priorities.\n\nTo view public comments received on the previous drafts of the AI RMF and Requests for Information, see the AI RMF Development page.\n\n## Translations&quot;,

After introducing and describing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations [...] or across extended periods. Examples include immediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the distribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term eﬀect of disinformation on societal trust in public institutions. The presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the characteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not limited to GAI model or system [...] Scope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation levels (i.e., for a speciﬁc use case), or at the ecosystem level – that is, beyond a single system or organizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of “algorithmic monocultures,3” resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to opportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 • Source of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design,&quot;,

Encourage dialogue and idea sharing to inspire the team to work different and leverage the technology we have to get the work done.” [...] \&quot;People need to change their behaviors and work differently to use AI,\&quot; Curran emphasizes. This counters the misconception that AI is a substitute for its human staff. As she puts it, \&quot;Everyone thinks it&#x27;s just going to turn itself on and do the work for you. But that’s not how it works. It’s another tool we use to work better. We are the humans in the loop. It doesn’t work without us, and we have to do our part.”&quot;,

Rather than hiring based on formal qualifications, leaders are looking for candidates with in-demand skills – or the capacity to learn them. This more inclusive approach widens talent pools, fosters diversity and creates fairer progression pathways across generations. But as Workday’s report notes, qualification bias in pay and promotion remains a barrier that HR leaders will need to address. [...] The Workday Asia Pacific Multigenerational Workplace Report, based on a survey of more than 3,300 leaders and employees across nine markets, highlights both the promise and the pitfalls of the Five Gen effect. A massive 88% of employees believe each generation has something to teach the others; and 86% agree that intergenerational collaboration is key to success. Yet 55% admit that misunderstandings are common when generations work together.&quot;,

      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/artificial-intelligence-in-hr&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI agents in HR\n\nIn a May 2025 Gartner webinar, 44% of HR leaders said their function plans to use semiautonomous AI agent capabilities in the next 12 months. Only 2% expect to deploy fully autonomous, unsupervised agents to replace human HR workers. Notably, two-thirds of HR leaders trust that AI agents will act in ways that benefit the employee experience. [...] AI agents are autonomous or semiautonomous software entities that use AI to perceive, decide, act and achieve goals in digital or physical environments. While the terms “AI agents” and “agentic AI” are often used interchangeably, Gartner distinguishes agentic AI as a broader approach — encompassing solutions built on software entities that fully or partially qualify as AI agents.\n\nAgentic AI has generated significant buzz for its potential to boost efficiency across business processes. [...] Emerging use cases for AI agents span multiple domains. However, the space is still maturing: AI agents range from simple, supervised tools to systems capable of independent decision making. Many vendors are rebranding basic chatbots and virtual assistants as “agents” without adding advanced, autonomous features.\n\nCHROs should cut through the hype and focus on high-value, practical applications. Gartner recommends starting with supervised agents that augment — not replace — human roles.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Forty percent of enterprise applications will be integrated with task-specific AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% today, according to Gartner Inc., a business and technology insights company. As organizations accelerate digital transformation, agentic AI in enterprise applications will move beyond individual productivity, setting new standards for teamwork and workflow through smarter human-agent interactions. [...] Collaboration among AI agents will redefine the boundaries of enterprise applications. By 2027, Gartner predicts one-third of agentic AI implementations will combine agents with different skills to manage complex tasks within application and data environments. [...] “AI agents will evolve rapidly, progressing from task and application specific agents to agentic ecosystems,” said Anushree Verma, Sr Director Analyst at Gartner. “This shift will transform enterprise applications from tools supporting individual productivity into platforms enabling seamless autonomous collaboration and dynamic workflow orchestration.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;It can analyze data in seconds. But it can’t decide what matters, set priorities, or inspire people to follow. That’s still human territory.\n\nAnd our workforce knows it. In our research, employees said they’re comfortable working with AI agents as copilots. But they draw the line at being managed by them.\n\nIn other words, AI can be an advisor and even a coach. But only humans can build connections and culture. [...] This is all part of the AI paradox leaders face today: AI won’t replace managers, but it will replace the way we manage. The org chart of the future won’t be a pyramid of boxes. It will be replaced by something new that delivers maximum value for the people who matter most.\n\nImagine customers at the center of everything. Employees collaborating across silos. AI agents as copilots. And leaders orchestrating connection, not just efficiency.
