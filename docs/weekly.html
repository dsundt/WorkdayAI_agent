<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>The week of December 20–27 marked a significant uptick in agentic AI actualization for SaaS. Workday and competitors formalized agent-ecosystem architectures through tool releases and developer initiatives, setting clear battle lines in both functionality and partner enablement. SAP Joule’s extensibility overtures and Dayforce’s practical agent launches confirm agentic AI is no longer theoretical—it is being embedded everywhere, disrupting traditional app-based models. iPaaS vendors like Workato, Boomi, and AWS continue to shift integration and automation to an agentic paradigm, blurring the lines among application, middleware, and workflow agent. Analysts and press emphasize that technological opportunity comes with a matching need for strong governance, leadership, and trust frameworks—a gap increasingly visible as organizations grapple with adoption and risk.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SAP (SuccessFactors & Joule):</b> <br>Issued new extensibility features and skill builder tools for Joule. <br><i>Implication</i>: Deloitte must keep pace with SAP’s developer empowerment. Being able to articulate the comparative benefits and risks of Workday versus SAP’s agent approaches is vital for helping clients make platform commitments and manage transformation risk.</li>
  <li><b>Dayforce:</b> <br>Delivered operational AI agents for scheduling, time, and employee engagement.<br><i>Implication</i>: Deloitte should position itself as the cross-vendor strategic advisor for agentic automation and integration.</li>
  <li><b>Workato, Boomi, AWS:</b> <br>Enhanced best practices and technical content on agentic iPaaS integration.<br><i>Implication</i>: Multi-agent and multi-platform orchestration expertise is now table stakes for advisory, integration, and managed services teams targeting SaaS/HCM/ERP landscapes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Developing and Deploying Custom Workday AI Agents:</b> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> — Consultants will be able to deliver end-to-end agent automation and orchestrate integrations, accelerating client transformation.</li>

  <li><b>Multi-Agent SaaS Solution Comparison and Client Advisory:</b> <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-joule-extensibility-with-joule-studio-skill-builder/ba-p/14268385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> — Practice will be able to credibly compare and recommend cross-ecosystem agentic blueprints, elevating Deloitte’s advisory value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initiate Workday agent developer toolset workshops for advisory and technical teams.</li>
  <li>Develop and distribute a cross-SaaS agent extensibility comparison matrix for client discussions.</li>
  <li>Update client roadmaps and engagement models to foreground agentic AI governance frameworks.</li>
  <li>Pilot Orchestrate/iPaaS agent demo for prioritized clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Client confusion/unmet expectations:</b> <br><i>Mitigation</i>: Enable comparative discovery sessions and prototype agentic workflows to clarify scope and value for each platform.</li>
  <li><b>Poor governance jeopardizing compliance/trust:</b> <br><i>Mitigation:</i> Bake AI risk and trust frameworks into all solution architectures and change programs.</li>
  <li><b>Skills gap in agent development/orchestration across platforms:</b> <br><i>Mitigation:</i> Prioritize enablement, certifications, and joint lab exercises for both client and Deloitte teams.</li>
</ul>

For Deloitte’s Workday practice, understanding Workday’s partnership and developer strategies, comparative agent approaches by SAP and Dayforce, and emerging governance mandates are critical for guiding clients through transformative change.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Expands Agentic AI Ecosystem with Agent Partner Network and Developer Toolset (published 2025-06-03, highlighted in context)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s announcement of a new AI Agent Partner Network and Agent Gateway marks a pivotal step toward a composable, extensible agentic ecosystem for HR and Finance (source: 2025-06-03, https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces). This move enables customers and partners—including Deloitte—to build and deploy custom AI agents, deeply embedding Workday’s platform in client transformation journeys. Alongside the Agent Gateway, Workday’s AI Developer Toolset allows developers to accelerate innovation by connecting, customizing, and orchestrating bespoke AI-driven workflows within Workday (source: 2025-06-03, https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform). \\n\\nThis signals a strategic inflection: Deloitte’s Workday teams must rapidly skill up in these toolsets to influence client conversations around AI extensibility, governance, and implementation risk. Moreover, as Workday’s developer ecosystem flourishes, Deloitte can influence high-value workflows, launch tailored advisory offerings, and differentiate practice value by architecting agentic solutions that orchestrate HR and Finance process automation at enterprise scale.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Joule and Dayforce AI Agents Raise Stakes for Multi-Agent SaaS Ecosystems (SAP blogs updated 2025-12-23, Dayforce newsroom 2025-12-21)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Joule’s week of extensibility announcements and Dayforce’s fresh updates to AI agents have expanded the competitive landscape for enterprise agentic AI. SAP’s latest coverage demonstrates deepening integration of Joule into SuccessFactors and its skill builder/Joule Studio toolkit, empowering developers and partners to create robust industry-specific agentic skills and logic (see https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-joule-extensibility-with-joule-studio-skill-builder/ba-p/14268385, published 2025-12-23).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dayforce’s new AI agent releases for time management, scheduling, and real-time employee engagement establish Dayforce as a practical innovator in operationalizing AI agents within workforce management platforms (see https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done, published 2025-12-21). For Deloitte and clients, these signals reinforce a shift toward multi-agent architectures, where scalability, interoperability, and skill marketplaces will define future value. Cross-vendor comparisons are now more urgent, making Deloitte’s advisory and system integration play multidimensional: clients will need not just solution blueprints, but strategic guidance for agent orchestration and governance across complex, multi-SaaS landscapes.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-joule-extensibility-with-joule-studio-skill-builder/ba-p/14268385\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;New Workday AI Orchestration: Workday Orchestrate Connects Data and Processes (Workday datasheet, updated 2025-12-24)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Orchestrate, highlighted in the latest product extension datasheets and integration documentation, underscores Workday’s focus on low-code/no-code orchestration for connecting enterprise data and automating agent activities (see https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/platform-product-extensions/integrations.html, updated 2025-12-24). Orchestrate now offers richer connectors and plug-and-play workflow automation, enabling rapid deployment and ongoing optimization of agentic solutions across HR and Finance.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday consultants, Orchestrate’s maturing capability represents both an opportunity and a mandate: teams must become fluent in new orchestration patterns, integration points, and policy guardrails. This is especially crucial as clients seek highly automated, but governable, agent-enabled processes that cross system boundaries, making Orchestrate a key differentiator in large, complex digital transformation projects.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/platform-product-extensions/integrations.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AWS, Boomi, and Workato Shape Agentic Integration Landscape (Boomi, Workato, AWS updates Dec 21–25, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Recent blogs and best-practices by Boomi (https://boomi.com/ja/blog/agentic-layers-of-ai-integration), Workato (https://www.workato.com/products/ipaas), and AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/category/post-types/best-practices) draw a clear architecture pattern for agentic integration: iPaaS and MCP platforms are rapidly positioning themselves as mission-critical middleware enabling agent-to-agent and process-to-process automations—regardless of underlying apps. Workato’s strong focus on agentic AI orchestration, and Boomi’s layered integration approach, illustrate a new normal: the middleware layer itself is now becoming an agentic platform, handling event triggers, workflow context passing, and governance for interconnected agents.\\n\\nDeloitte’s Workday projects must now incorporate integration design as a core part of agentic delivery—and proactively address client need for secure, governed, and scalable agent-to-platform-to-agent flows. This also heats up the competitive context: SAP, Workday, ServiceNow, and Dayforce each look to claim this orchestration space, making integration and automation consultancies critical partners and competitors all at once.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workato.com/products/ipaas\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Analysts Highlight Agentic AI’s Governance and Talent Risks (Forrester; CIO/CIO.com ‘Employee Optimism’ and ‘AI Trust Gap’ articles, published Dec 20–24, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Coverage from Forrester and CIO.com spotlights a crucial, often-overlooked aspect of the current AI wave: growing leadership, trust, and governance gaps as agency grows within SaaS ecosystems (https://www.cio.com/article/4108605/4-mandates-for-cios-to-bridge-the-ai-trust-gap.html, published 2025-12-21). CIO.com’s ‘Employee AI Optimism Lost to a Leadership Void’ (https://www.cio.com/article/4109172/employee-ai-optimism-lost-to-an-ai-leadership-void.html, published 2025-12-22) finds that while employees welcome AI-enabled productivity, organizational misalignment and lack of clear AI governance stall adoption, increase risk, and reduce business impact. \\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this is a clarion call: embedding agentic AI must come hand-in-hand with strategic leadership on risk governance, change management, and ethical guardrails. Deloitte can differentiate by fusing technical implementation with organizational readiness, offering holistic guidance that protects and maximizes enterprise AI investments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4108605/4-mandates-for-cios-to-bridge-the-ai-trust-gap.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP (SuccessFactors &amp; Joule)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Released extensibility enhancements for Joule/SuccessFactors with developer tooling updates and skill builder integrations (published 2025-12-23).\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP is actively enabling customers and GSIs to build custom agentic solutions on its platform.

Agent Gateway (published 2025-06-03, https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces). Workday empowers clients and partners—including Deloitte—to co-create workflow automation and digital agent solutions. The AI Developer Toolset (https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform) enables rapid solutioning and positions Deloitte to guide clients through innovation, integration, and AI risk management.\\n- SAP Joule &amp; Dayforce Expand Agentic Feature Sets (SAP blogs updated 2025-12-23, Dayforce newsroom 2025-12-21): SAP Joule Studio Skill Builder (https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-joule-extensibility-with-joule-studio-skill-builder/ba-p/14268385) and Dayforce newsroom (https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done) showcase intensive competition in agentic workflow automation.\\n- Workday Orchestrate Elevates Connectivity (updated 2025-12-24): Workday Orchestrate (https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/platform-product-extensions/integrations.html) has advanced its enterprise low-code/no-code capabilities for agentic workflow deployment—critical for Deloitte client delivery.\\n- Workato, Boomi, AWS Redefine Agentic AI Middleware (Boomi, Workato, AWS updates Dec 21–25, 2025): Workato (https://www.workato.com/products/ipaas), Boomi (https://boomi.com/ja/blog/agentic-layers-of-ai-integration), and AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/category/post-types/best-practices) are driving the shift to middleware-led agent orchestration.\\n- Governance, Talent, and Trust—Analyst Perspective (CIO.com, Forrester Dec 20–24): CIO.com urges firms to address the AI leadership and trust gap (https://www.cio.com/article/4108605/4-mandates-for-cios-to-bridge-the-ai-trust-gap.html), warning that technological agent adoption must be governed by organizational and ethical frameworks (see https://www.cio.com/article/4109172/employee-ai-optimism-lost-to-an-ai-leadership-void.html).\\n\\nWhat changed this week:\\nBetween Dec 20–27, Workday, SAP, Dayforce, and Key iPaaS vendors formalized the shift to agentic and developer-first SaaS architectures. Agent extensibility, orchestration, and middleware capabilities are no longer abstract—they are live, expanding, and reshaping client RFPs and transformation priorities. Each platform now requires Deloitte’s advice and integration expertise for both technology and change enablement.\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- SAP (SuccessFactors &amp; Joule): Launched developer/skill builder tools (https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-joule-extensibility-with-joule-studio-skill-builder/ba-p/14268385). Deloitte must provide cross-platform, cross-vendor guidance, comparing agentic feature coverage and governance.\\n- Dayforce: Introduced new operational AI agents (https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done). Deloitte should help clients blend agentic best-of-breed solutions.\\n- Workato, Boomi, AWS: Enhanced agentic orchestration best practices (https://www.workato.com/products/ipaas, https://boomi.com/ja/blog/agentic-layers-of-ai-integration, https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/category/post-types/best-practices).
