  <li><strong>Workday and Microsoft Deepen Collaboration to Deliver Unified AI Agent Experience</strong> (<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the story</a>, 2025-09-16)<br>
    Workday and Microsoft’s integration provides seamless bidirectional access between Workday and Microsoft agentic services, allowing business users to trigger and monitor actions across platforms. The move elevates the strategic role of both companies, with Workday strengthening HCM-ERP relevance and Deloitte expanding from technical delivery to orchestrator of business transformation.

  <li><strong>Workday Orchestrate & Dev Toolset Propel Agentic Integrations</strong> (<a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the story</a>, 2025-06-03)<br>
    The Orchestrate platform enables developers/consultants to create and connect AI agents across heterogeneous SaaS and legacy systems, substantially increasing the flexibility and agility of Workday-based workflows. Deloitte can co-innovate on client-specific use cases, positioning itself as a transformation partner.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Industry Analysts Assert: Agentic Reality Disrupting SaaS & IT Operating Models</strong> (<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the analysis</a>, late 2025)<br>
    Deloitte’s Tech Trends and Agentic Reality Check propose that emergence of autonomous, collaborative AI agents will fundamentally alter organizational roles, governance, risk, and competitive advantage. Deloitte must offer not only build but also advisory, change and risk management, and adoption services aligned to clients’ stage on the agentic maturity curve.
  </li>
  <li><strong>UKG Launches Bryte AI Agents, Signaling Multi-Vendor Agentic Expansion</strong> (<a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the announcement</a>, 2025-12-06)<br>
    UKG’s Bryte agents platform expands employee-facing agentic intelligence in HCM, challenging Workday and making advisor-led, best-of-breed integration services more relevant.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Watch: Enterprises Confront New AI Audit & Governance Requirements</strong> (<a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-gb/navigating-eu-ai-act-what-business-leaders-need-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyst insight</a>, ongoing)<br>
    With new EU, US and ISO regulations, procurement and management of AI agents now require robust governance. Workday’s reporting/advisory capabilities and Deloitte’s compliance frameworks are now must-haves, not options.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Workday Expands Agent Partner Network, Signaling Ecosystem Play</strong> (<a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Expands-Agent-Partner-Network-With-New-Ventures-Partners-to-Deliver-Enterprise-Ready-AI-Agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a>, 2025-09-16)<br>
    Workday’s Agent Partner Network, including Agent Gateway, lowers the barrier for partners and system integrators to deliver and curate advanced agentic solutions on Workday—and demands continuous innovation/feed-in from Deloitte and others.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>This week marked the intensification of the agentic AI race within the SaaS ecosystem. The unification of Workday AI agents with Microsoft’s Copilot and Agent Factory workflows, alongside UKG’s release of Bryte agents, has set a new bar for extensibility and user experience in enterprise applications. Industry analysis underscores a transition to collaborative, continuously-learning agents, driving a shift in IT and business operating models.</p>
<p>Clients now demand agentic flexibility, composite workflows spanning multiple vendors, and regulatory compliance baked in from the start. The agent partner network model, as expanded by Workday, is catalyzing a move from monolithic SaaS to open ecosystems. Deloitte must keep pace by strengthening orchestration, advisory, and managed compliance offerings for enterprise clients undergoing AI-driven transformation.</p>
<p>The regulatory drumbeat is getting louder: the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001 certifications, and new ethical AI mandates are turning audit and explainability from differentiators into baseline requirements. Failure to address these will open the door to risk—and opportunity for trusted advisors and solution architects.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UKG:</strong> <em>Launched Bryte AI agents</em> (<a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details</a>) — Raises the stakes for flexible, composable agentic services spanning multiple deployment models. Deloitte can help clients develop robust integration and agentic enablement strategies in hybrid HCM landscapes.</li>
  <li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> <em>Expanded Agent Script</em> (<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/script" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read more</a>) — No-code agent workflow creation and execution is now expected, not exceptional. Raises pressure on Deloitte’s Workday team to develop rapid discovery, design, and configuration prototypes for clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> <em>Agent Factory and Copilot agents</em> (<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>) — Composability, not just intelligence, is the key. Enterprise IT transformation must include deep integration across cloud and agent ecosystems, playing to Deloitte’s strengths in tech architecture and change management.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP/KPMG:</strong> <em>ISO/IEC 42001 AI certification</em> (<a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/12/kpmg-international-first-to-attain-iso-certification-for-ai-management-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release</a>) — Compliance and governance are the new battleground; Deloitte must anticipate, not react, with AI audit toolkits and risk frameworks for clients.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritize cross-functional client workshops on mapping agentic workflow opportunities and best-of-breed integration options.</li>
  <li>Develop and test an in-house AI agent governance and compliance toolkit, leveraging guidance from EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001.</li>
  <li>Convene an internal panel on evolving advisory services for hybrid and regulated AI agent deployments.</li>
  <li>Engage with Workday and Agent Partner Network for co-developed use cases and thought leadership targeting priority verticals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Regulatory readiness gap:</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> Integrate compliance and audit capabilities from the earliest advisory stages and ongoing project operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor lock-in on agentic architectures:</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> Champion solutions that are composable, interoperable, and API-driven, with clear governance over agent life cycle.</li>
  <li><strong>Change and adoption fatigue:</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> Embed change management and capability building in every engagement, ensuring staff empowerment and reduced friction.</li>
</ul>

Converging themes: cross-vendor alliances, developer enablement, and regulatory readiness.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday and Microsoft Deepen Collaboration to Deliver Unified AI Agent Experience (Published 2025-09-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday and Microsoft’s partnership to create a unified AI agent experience marks a leap in enterprise user experience, integrating Workday’s HR/Finance-focused AI agents with Microsoft’s Copilot and other workflow tools. The collaboration ensures bidirectional interoperability, letting business users trigger processes and insights seamlessly across both platforms. For Workday, this alliance solidifies its enterprise relevance beyond HCM/ERP by embedding extensible, agentic capabilities into the modern digital workplace, addressing growing customer demand for integration and context-aware automation. Deloitte’s Workday practice sees amplified opportunity in orchestrating cross-cloud workflows for clients while positioning itself as a strategic business transformation enabler rather than just a deployment firm. For the broader SaaS market, unified agentic experiences foreshadow a move toward marketplace ecosystems versus single-vendor lock-in.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Orchestrate &amp; Dev Toolset Propel Agentic Integrations (Published 2025-06-03)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday unveiled a new Orchestrate toolset and expanded developer capabilities enabling enterprises to connect Workday AI agents with third-party services and legacy systems. Orchestrate acts as a “connective tissue,” letting developers design, deploy, and monitor cross-application workflows while managing security, compliance, and data lineage. The toolset’s low-code/no-code interface accelerates adoption and experimentation. For clients, this means faster time-to-value and the flexibility to build on Workday’s native intelligence infrastructure. Deloitte can differentiate around co-innovation with customers—e.g., by helping design industry-specific agent workflows or integrating proprietary data sources into Workday agent flows. Strategic consultancies may also pivot to managed orchestration offerings, reducing complexity in sprawling enterprise tech stacks.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Industry Analysts Assert: Agentic Reality Disrupting SaaS &amp; IT Operating Models (Published late 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte’s major 2026 Tech Trends report and its perspective on agentic AI (“Agentic Reality Check”) underscore a disruptive shift from pre-defined automation toward continuously learning, autonomous, and collaborative software agents. Analysts warn that organizational structures, IT governance, and skills must adjust, as agentic AI transforms role design, operating responsibility, and strategic differentiation. Leaders must build capabilities in agent orchestration, change management, and system-wide ethical risk mitigation. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, taking a leadership role in the agentic reality narrative opens doors to new advisory, design, and change management work—not merely technical implementation—in markets where the agentic maturity curve will dictate competitive advantage.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;UKG Launches Bryte AI Agents, Signaling Multi-Vendor Agentic Expansion (Published 2025-12-06)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;UKG introduced Bryte AI agents to its HCM suite, focusing on contextual, employee-facing digital experiences and hybrid agent architectures. Bryte integrates deeply with UKG Pro and connects via ecosystem APIs. This signals a maturing market where solution differentiation pivots to real-world agent deployment, flexibility, and seamless employee experience. For Workday, the addressable market for agentic solutions is growing—but so too is the need to iterate on user-centric design and composability. Deloitte’s opportunity will be to help clients decide where and how to deploy best-of-breed agents versus platform-native options, amplifying advisory services, especially in hybrid HR environments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Regulatory Watch: Enterprises Confront New AI Audit &amp; Governance Requirements (Ongoing; reinforced by Oct–Dec 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Amid expansion of AI agent deployment, new regulatory guidance and audits (EU AI Act, EEOC initiatives, ISO/IEC 42001 certification) create a compliance imperative for SaaS, HCM, and ERP platforms. Research and analyst insights highlight the need for proactive auditability (e.g., agent decision logs, bias testing, explainability), with platform vendors and system integrators like Deloitte expected to provide frameworks for risk-mitigated adoption. This adds a consultative lens: Deloitte must assist clients not just in implementing AI agents, but in standing up robust AI risk management and compliance operations—potentially bundled into managed service models.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-gb/navigating-eu-ai-act-what-business-leaders-need-know.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Expands Agent Partner Network, Signaling Ecosystem Play (Published 2025-09-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s Agent Partner Network now includes new Ventures-backed providers and an Agent Gateway for curating, testing, and deploying pre-built and custom AI agents.
