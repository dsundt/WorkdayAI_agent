These agents now automate high-value, repetitive work such as skills tracking, onboarding, and compliance. This shift positions agentic AI as core to Workday’s offering, not an afterthought. For Deloitte, client demand has matured towards large-scale, production deployments, making AI agent fluency essential for consulting teams who must now address both technical and ethical implementation. The unified approach outpaces fragmented feature sets seen elsewhere.<br><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Illuminate-TM-Expands-with-New-AI-Agents-for-HR,-Finance,-and-Industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More</a></li><li><strong>Dayforce Rolls Out AI-Powered Agents for Workflow Acceleration (Published: 2025-12-28)</strong><br><a href="https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dayforce</a> announced AI agents that automate HR support, answer employee queries, detect payroll anomalies, and dynamically ensure compliance. Initial adoption in healthcare and media signals these agents are succeeding beyond visions, moving into practical domain automation. For consultants, this places higher competitive pressure to benchmark cross-platform agent capabilities, and to guide clients on integrating or choosing among vendors based on real outcomes and extensibility.<br><a href="https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More</a></li><li><strong>NIST Publishes New AI Risk Management Guidance, Bolsters Trust in Enterprise AI Agents (Published: 2025-12-29)</strong><br><a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/nist-ai-rmf-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST</a> added detailed playbooks to its AI RMF, providing actionable steps for responsible agentic AI rollouts. These new controls target explainability, bias management, and continuous risk assessment—a direct answer to pressure from clients and regulators in HR and finance where automation and fairness must be proven, not assumed. For Deloitte, operationalizing these controls into Workday and broader SaaS engagements is now fundamental to de-risking and winning trust.<br><a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/nist-ai-rmf-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More</a></li><li><strong>Deloitte’s AI Data Engineering Suite: Market Enablement for Agentic SaaS (Updated: 2025-12-30)</strong><br><a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/services/ai-data-engineering-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte’s Data Assist™</a> is now positioned as the connective tissue for agentic automation in cloud HCM/ERP.

Workday’s agentic roadmap, now reinforced with fresh platform updates, places cognitive workflow automation at the core of its SaaS vision—spanning HR, finance, and compliance. Meanwhile, Dayforce moved aggressively with customer-facing AI agents, forcing the competitive set to focus on agent maturity, verticalization, and real-world adoption metrics over hype.</p><p>Externally, NIST published detailed frameworks to regulate the responsible deployment of enterprise AI agents, raising the bar for risk and compliance readiness. In parallel, leading research (HBR) elevated the conversation from enablement to fairness assurance—a trend felt acutely in client and boardroom agendas. Deloitte’s Data Assist™ gains new relevance as an enabler for trustworthy agentic SaaS deployments, bridging data readiness and compliance at scale.</p><p>The ecosystem now expects trusted, orchestrated, explainable AI agents—mandating cross-vendor awareness, hands-on enablement, and executive-level assurance for SaaS project success.</p><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><strong>Dayforce</strong><br>New AI agents deliver real-time HR, payroll, and compliance support (Dec 28), challenging Workday’s position on workflow automation.

For Deloitte’s Workday practice, staying at the forefront of agent enablement and regulatory compliance remains mission-critical as client expectations rapidly mature.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Broadens AI Agent Portfolio Across HR and Finance (Published: 2025-09-16, renewed focus this week)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday recently expanded its Illuminate™ platform to include new AI Agents tailored for HR, Finance, and industry-specific domains. These agents are engineered to perform high-value, repetitive tasks, such as skills-detection, onboarding orchestration, and compliance monitoring, further cementing Workday’s focus on continuous automation and personalizing enterprise workflows. The update underscores Workday’s commitment to agentic AI as more than just an add-on: it’s being woven directly into product verticals.\\n\\nFor Deloitte, this means clients are demanding measurable ROI from embedded AI, transforming engagement models from proof-of-concept to large-scale rollouts. Practices must skill up in AI agent deployment, customization via Workday Extend, and assurance on fairness/safety. Workday’s roadmap signals that Deloitte specialists will need to advise across a spectrum: from technical integration to change management and ethical risk assessment. \\n\\nCritically, Workday’s harmonized approach contrasts with piecemeal AI features from some rivals, positioning it as a platform for holistic, composable automation.

These agents manage complex tasks such as payroll anomaly detection, employee query resolution, and proactive compliance interventions—moving beyond static analytics to dynamic, context-aware action. The company reports early customer wins in healthcare and media, underlining the attractiveness of domain-tuned automation.\\n\\nFor SaaS competitors and consulting partners (like Deloitte), Dayforce’s pivots upend traditional managed service tactics. Their embrace of agentic AI raises the bar for seamless, AI-driven support. Solution advisors must benchmark Workday’s agent depth and flexibility against Dayforce to guide clients in tool selection, extension strategies, and ecosystem integration.\\n\\nThe Dayforce innovation exemplifies the urgency for Deloitte teams to anticipate future-state client needs in agent governance, performance monitoring, and user enablement.

These guidelines lay out specific controls, benchmarks, and crosswalks for responsible AI deployment, drawing direct connections to HR, payroll, and talent modules found in systems like Workday and Dayforce. \\n\\nThis regulatory momentum means Deloitte’s Workday practice must proactively build NIST-compliant assurance into agent implementation—covering explainability, bias mitigation, and continuous validation. Clients increasingly scrutinize AI tool selection through a risk/compliance lens; thus, incorporating NIST best practices into project roadmaps becomes a competitive advantage. \\n\\nDeloitte can leverage these resources to differentiate with trusted agent deployments and end-to-end ethical oversight.

The offering packages data quality, orchestration, and compliance checkpoints—addressing the main friction points encountered when scaling agentic automations inside Workday, Oracle, and SAP.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“There are likely to be many documents or data sets in a company that don’t have permissions correctly locked down,” he says, in the company’s 2026 AI predictions. “If you feed that into generative or agentic AI, the tool may expose data that it shouldn’t.”\n\nIt&#x27;s not just internal productivity at stake either, according to Saleforce. It is each company&#x27;s image and reputation in the marketplace, predicts Adam Evans, EVP &amp; GM, Salesforce AI. [...] Ramsey urged companies to start small and look for the task that is “bleeding time and money,” then fix it end-to-end with AI. But to make that effective, he turned the conversation back to governance.\n\n“You need one entry point with clear policies and approvals,” he said. “A secure foundation for your AI is how you turn an isolated win into a repeatable pattern that scales across your business.” [...] In terms of governing AI agents, Snowflake CISO Brad Jones says the job in front of his counterparts is to walk the line between putting up guardrails around their behavior while leaving room for operators to experiment and innovate, which is a job for data governance.&quot;,

      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.zhihu.com/tardis/zm/art/675509396&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;提供多样化的上下文：因为你可以从不同的角度查看用户的查询，所以顶级结果里会出现更多样化的内容片段。与专注于单一视角的内容段落相比，你更有可能看到能够涵盖话题多个方面的内容作为顶级结果出现。\n   额外的控制层面：像其他机器学习解决方案一样，RAG融合提供了额外的控制手柄，让你可以微调你的应用，并让它更加符合你的期望目标。\n   自动校正：通过使用LLM作为用户在文本框中输入内容与实际在数据库中搜索内容之间的中间人，你可以纠正拼写错误，添加与用户查询相关的上下文信息（关于用户的信息、时间、他们的账户状态等），以及/或潜在地筛选特定类型的内容。 [...] ### 缺点：\n\n   延迟:正如你现在可能知道的，LLMs需要大量的计算资源，因此它们的速度相对较慢(相对于应用程序中的其他部分)。根据你的应用程序，向LLM发送一次额外的请求可能会让用户的体验变得糟糕，因为他们可能需要等待几百毫秒的时间。\n   自动纠错:是的，这是一个优点，但是当它不起作用时，也可能是一个缺点。这通常发生在你的内容包含内部术语或行话，而这些术语或行话没有出现在LLM学习过的数据中。在这种情况下，LLM可能会出现困惑并生成完全无关的查询，从而影响到最后的结果。\n   成本:正如之前讨论的，如果RAG融合对你应用程序的整体效益贡献不大，你最终可能会花费更多的费用，但收益却很有限。\n\n有了以上的介绍，接下来讨论一下在什么情况下最有可能通过实现RAG融合得到好的效果。如果你的应用程序的内容主要基于常见概念，那么你更有可能从使用RAG融合中获益良多。\n\nImage 20\n\n### RAG融合n不适用场景 [...] 数据向量化后构建索引，并写入数据库的过程可以概述为数据入库过程，适用于RAG场景的数据库包括：FAISS、Chromadb、ES、milvus等。一般可以根据业务场景、硬件、性能需求等多因素综合考虑，选择合适的数据库。\n\nImage 7\n\n### 应用阶段：\n\n在应用阶段，可以根据用户的提问，通过高效的检索方法，召回与提问最相关的知识，并融入Prompt；大模型参考当前提问和相关知识，生成相应的答案。关键环节包括：数据检索、注入Prompt等。\n\nImage 8\n\n数据检索\n\n   数据检索\n\n常见的数据检索方法包括：相似性检索、全文检索等，根据检索效果，一般可以选择多种检索方式融合，提升召回率。\n\n       相似性检索：即计算查询向量与所有存储向量的相似性得分，返回得分高的记录。常见的相似性计算方法包括：余弦相似性、欧氏距离、曼哈顿距离等。\n       全文检索：全文检索是一种比较经典的检索方式，在数据存入时，通过关键词构建倒排索引；在检索时，通过关键词进行全文检索，找到对应的记录。\n\n   注入Prompt\n\nImage 9\n\nLLM生成&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;2. 增强：将检索到的信息用作生成模型（即大语言模型）的上下文输入，以增强模型对特定问题的理解和回答能力。这一步的目的是将外部知识融入生成过程中，使生成的文本内容更加丰富、准确和符合用户需求。\n\n3. 生成：结合LLM生成符合用户需求的回答。生成器会利用检索到的信息作为上下文输入，并结合大语言模型来生成文本内容。\n\n## 三、RAG流程及问题分析\n\n### （1）文档导入\n\n在该阶段要把使用到的文档都进行导入。由于文档涉及多种格式，比如常见的有：WORD、PDF、PPT、Excel、TXT、Markdown等，格式不同，处理的方式也不同。因此，如何读取和处理文档是文档导入阶段需要做好考虑。\n\n### （2）文档标注\n\n在导入文档后，我们需要将文档分割并标注成一系列的片段（chunks）。如果分块过大，可能会混入过多无关信息，从而降低检索的准确性和效率。反之，如果分块过小，则可能导致丢失重要的上下文信息，使得生成的回答缺乏连贯性和深度。\n\n为了平衡这一点，选择合适的分块大小至关重要，既要确保每个片段足够小以便于管理，又要保证足够的上下文以维持信息的连贯性和完整性。 [...] 在用户提问环节，若问题显得过于简单或表达不够明确，这些因素均可能削弱大模型的最终表现效果。为了更精准地捕捉用户的真实意图，我们在问题处理阶段会采取优化与重写的策略，对用户的提问进行精细调整。\n\n### （5） 向量检索\n\n系统需要将用户提出的问题转化为向量形式，然后在向量数据库中进行检索。这一过程中，同样存在着多种不同的检索技术方案可供选择。常用的检索算法包括基于距离的检索（如欧氏距离、余弦相似度等）和基于近似最近邻（ANN）的检索算法（如LSH、HNSW、IVF等）。\n\n### （6） Reranking\n\n在处理检索结果时，我们并不直接将初始检索结果呈现给用户，而是采用Reranking（重排模型）步骤对检索结果进行精细化处理。\n\n重排模型通过深度分析初始检索列表中的各项内容，实施更为细致的相关性评估和重新排序，旨在精准捕捉用户查询背后的真实意图与期望。 [...] Document Embedding是将整篇文档转换为一个向量。在文档检索、文档分类等任务中，Document Embedding能够捕捉文档的整体语义信息。类似于Sentence Embedding，但可能需要考虑文档的更长范围和更复杂结构。\n\n4. Contextual Embedding（上下文嵌入）\n\nContextual Embedding考虑了单词或句子在特定上下文中的意义。在需要理解语言上下文的场景中，如机器翻译、对话系统等，Contextual Embedding能够提供更加准确和丰富的语义信息。基于Transformer的模型（如BERT）是实现Contextual Embedding的典型代表。\n\n5. Custom Embedding（自定义嵌入）\n\n根据特定任务和数据集训练的Embedding模型。在特定领域或任务中，Custom Embedding能够更准确地捕捉数据的内在规律和语义信息。通常需要使用深度学习模型，并在大规模标注数据集上进行训练。\n\n### （4）用户提问&quot;,

And this is just the beginning. Our commitment to continuously evolve the platform, providing the most powerful and intuitive tools to bring ideas to life, remains strong, with a laser focus on empowering individuals to do their best work. [...] AI Widgets: Developers will be able to add AI-powered widgets into apps and define custom prompts, offering users personalized AI assistance for quickly creating and refining content across HR and finance use cases.\n Expanded AI Gateway APIs: These new APIs allow developers to natively integrate new Workday AI services into Extend apps, enabling users to ask questions about reports and understand documents using natural language. [...] ### Developer Copilot Expansion\n\nAdditionally, we’re significantly expanding Developer Copilot, a conversational AI companion designed to help developers code faster across Workday Extend.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### What is Workday Extend?\n\nWorkday Extend allows users to create custom applications that work alongside or in tandem with other Workday applications. Workday Extend is made up of various app components to create the custom process logic, pages and appearances of the applications. The three main app components are Presentation, Model and Orchestration. [...] This app is an employee experience app created for a commercial real estate client. Like the CEO Excellence Award App, this app gives employees the opportunity to nominate other employees who uphold the company’s mission and values. The app was created to improve employee morale and satisfaction. Workday Extend apps allowed the developer to create the application in Workday, giving it a similar look to their other applications, making using it easy to learn. [...] Below are examples of real-world uses of Workday Extend that Cognizant’s Workday practice built for our clients to help meet their specific needs. Using Workday Extend gives operators the advantage of creating applications for a wide range of purposes. They are faster to build than creating an application from scratch and look and work just as other Workday applications do.\n\n#### CEO Excellence Award App&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As agentic AI becomes a more embedded part of how business operates, the question is not whether human work will remain relevant. It’s how organizations will empower it with AI to grow its impact and value.\n\n## What’s Next for AI Agents?\n\nThe future of agentic AI is not a linear extension of what we see today. AI agents will introduce new frameworks for enterprise systems, workforce design, and decision-making models. The most important developments to watch include: [...] Rather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work. [...] The role of agentic AI is expanding—and so is the scope of decisions that must be made around it. Leaders must be intentional when shaping that transformation to unlock long-term advantage.\n\nWant to go deeper on how agentic AI is transforming work at scale?

This is the usual expression if you mean those five days.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;&gt; Roxxxannne said:\n&gt;\n&gt; I will/I&#x27;ll [verb] and I&#x27;ll be [verb]-ing are both American, but I will/I&#x27;ll [verb] is more common. I think the use of I&#x27;ll be [verb]-ing depends on the verb. For instance, I&#x27;ll be leaving now is used fairly often compared to I&#x27;ll leave now.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;  I&#x27;ve never heard anyone say I&#x27;ll be shutting up now to refer to not talking. I can imagine a manager of a store saying it at the end of the workday, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; Click to expand...

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This solution uses custom-coded, specialized AI agents that collaborate to break down complex organizational tasks into manageable components. Each agent contributes domain-specific knowledge and capabilities. This approach enables the system to manage sophisticated workflows that would otherwise require human coordination across multiple departments. The architecture scales through containerized deployment, preserves learning via persistent data storage, and supports continuous improvement [...] collaborative problem-solving. Handoff patterns give specialized agents the ability to handle different workflow phases. For detailed guidance about how to implement these coordination strategies, see AI agent orchestration patterns. This article provides architectural patterns and implementation considerations for various multi-agent scenarios. [...] Current approach: This solution uses custom agent code, written with the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK, to orchestrate agents and their interactions. Container Apps serves as the central orchestrator compute that runs the code. The code coordinates the multiple AI agents that operate on active workflows. This approach is a code-first solution that provides maximum control over agent behavior, orchestration logic, and compute scale.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;That stability eroded as successive waves introduced NoSQL document stores, graph databases, and most recently vector-based systems. In the era of agentic AI, data infrastructure is once again in flux — and evolving faster than at any point in recent memory.\n\nAs 2026 dawns, one lesson has become unavoidable: data matters more than ever.\n\n## RAG is dead. Long live RAG [...] Perhaps the most consequential trend out of 2025 that will continue to be debated into 2026 (and maybe beyond) is the role of RAG.\n\nThe problem is that the original RAG pipeline architecture is much like a basic search. The retrieval finds the result of a specific query, at a specific point in time. It is also often limited to a single data source, or at least that&#x27;s the way RAG pipelines were built in the past (the past being anytime prior to June 2025). [...] While RAG won&#x27;t entirely disappear in 2026, one approach that will likely surpass it in terms of usage for agentic AI is contextual memory, also known as agentic or long-context memory. This technology enables LLMs to store and access pertinent information over extended periods.&quot;,

[...] Processing: Instead of a human reading 500 incidents, Now Assist parses the text to identify the User, Old Dept, and New Dept.\n\nExecution: \\ For systems with APIs (like Workday), we use Integration Hub.\n\nFor the legacy \&quot;In-house Portal,\&quot; we trigger an RPA Unattended Robot.\n\nExample script that we can embed into Agentic-workflow agent : [...] # The Rise of Agentic AI - Automating the \&quot;Un‑automatable\&quot; with Now Assist, Flow Designer, and RPA Hub\n\nRatnakar7\n\nTuesday\n\nTraditional automation in ServiceNow relies on writing logic and checks in Flow Designer, REST APIs, scripts, and scheduled jobs. These flows generate events, assign manual tasks to teams, and wait for completion. It&#x27;s essentially a predefined If‑This‑Then‑That model - rigid and static.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What is ServiceNow &amp; Where Do I Fit ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## 3. A Modern AI Platform\n\nServiceNow is also an AI platform that is reimagining how work gets done. It&#x27;s AI capabilties can mostly be broken down into two groups:\n\n• Agentic Workflows that can reason through complex tasks, like diagnosing outages or orchestrating multi-step resolutions.  \n• Generative AI Tools like Build Agent that help accelerate development by generating comments, code snippets, and even entire workflows.\n\n## \n\n## Why This Matters [...] For most companies, ServiceNow shows up first as a suite of enterprise apps. Think IT Service Management, HR Service Delivery, and Customer Service Management all running on a single platform. That shared foundation means workflows across departments can connect and talk to each other seamlessly.\n\nIf you&#x27;re implementing ServiceNow in your organization, this is probably the lens you&#x27;re familiar with. But it&#x27;s just the beginning.\n\n## \n\n## 2. A Development Platform for All Skill Levels [...] As the platform continues to evolve, understanding ServiceNow from these three perspectives helps you find your own path in the ecosystem.\n\nRoopanshiR\n\nI can&#x27;t access any of the video.\n\nIt says \&quot;Your organization blocked this. Contact your IT admin for more info.\&quot; what should I do?\n\nAdministrator\nTravis Toulson&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Qwen-Image-2512 is not positioned as a universal replacement for Gemini 3 Pro Image.\n\nGoogle’s model benefits from deep integration with Vertex AI, Workspace, Ads, and Gemini’s broader reasoning stack.

Free quotas are limited, and usage transitions to paid billing once credits are exhausted.\n\nThis hybrid approach—open weights paired with a commercial API—mirrors how many enterprises deploy AI today: experimentation and customization in-house, with managed services layered on where operational simplicity matters.\n\n### Competitive, but philosophically different [...] All Posts\n\n# Open source Qwen-Image-2512 launches to compete with Google&#x27;s Nano Banana Pro in high quality AI image generation\n\nCarl Franzen\n\nWhen Google released its newest AI image model Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image) in November, it reset expectations for the entire field.\n\nFor the first time, uses of an image model could use natural language to generate dense, text-heavy infographics, slides, and other enterprise-grade visuals without spelling errors.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The meta-analysis supported our theoretical framework,” Lu says. “Both dimensions are important:Individuals evaluate whether or not AI is more capable than people at a given task, and whether the task calls for personalization. People will prefer AI only if they think the AI is more capable than humans and the task is nonpersonal.”\n\nHe adds: “The key idea here is that high perceived capability alone does not guarantee AI appreciation. Personalization matters too.” [...] For example, people tend to favor AI when it comes to detecting fraud or sorting large datasets — areas where AI’s abilities exceed those of humans in speed and scale, and personalization is not required. But they are more resistant to AI in contexts like therapy, job interviews, or medical diagnoses, where they feel a human is better able to recognize their unique circumstances. [...] A new study finds that people are neither entirely enthusiastic nor totally averse to AI. Rather than falling into camps of techno-optimists and Luddites, people are discerning about the practical upshot of using AI, case by case. \n\nCredits:\n\n Credit: Christine Daniloff, MIT; iStock \n\nPrevious image Next image&quot;,

He urged attendees to evaluate algorithms \&quot;early and often for biased outcomes and reengineer as appropriate.\&quot; [...] A University of Washington study found that participants generally followed the hiring recommendations of biased large language models.&quot;,

[...] “Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making tools have great potential to improve our lives, including in the area of employment,” Burrows said. “At the same time, the EEOC is keenly aware that these tools may mask and perpetuate bias or create new discriminatory barriers to jobs. We must work to ensure that these new technologies do not become a high-tech pathway to discrimination.”&quot;,

[...] The EEOC under Lucas has since removed some AI-related documents while it reviews them in line with a Trump order that revoked Biden administration-era AI policies. The Trump administration is unlikely to prioritize disparate impact claims related to AI discrimination, and a recent memo from the attorney general directed the DOJ to limit the use of disparate impact theories.\n\nDEI Programs [...] In the meantime, the EEOC is declining to enforce the harassment guidance by dismissing its own lawsuits alleging sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination filed under the Biden administration. One such case is the EEOC’s against Harmony Hospitality LLC, which operates a Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel in Alabama. This month, the EEOC filed a joint motion to dismiss its case, just eight months after the agency sued the company over its firing of an employee who identifies as nonbinary&quot;,

As part of this assessment, employers should continue to be deliberate and strategic about their actions, particularly given the drastic changes over the past two months and the lack, to date, of guidance on some important remaining issues.  While DEI [...] While the Executive Orders explicitly articulated the federal government’s intent to root out and punish “illegal DEI,” employers lacked guidance concerning the meaning and scope of this term.  The technical assistance guidelines released this week answer some, but not all, questions about the meaning and scope of “illegal DEI”.&quot;,

The other warns that algorithms can reproduce and even amplify existing inequalities at scale.

On April 19, 2024, the EEOC published its final rule and interpretive guidance implementing the PWFA, which clarified the agency’s interpretation of “qualified” employees and reasonable accommodations. The final regulations [...] In the lawsuit, the EEOC alleged the employer had failed to accommodate an employee who experienced a stillbirth. The employee had sent the employer a doctor’s note stating that she could not return to work for “approximately six (6) weeks to recuperate and to grieve.” However, a day after receiving the note, the employer terminated the employee’s employment without engaging in the interactive process.&quot;,

[...] The Framework is intended to be voluntary, rights-preserving, non-sector specific, and use-case agnostic, providing flexibility to organizations of all sizes and in all sectors and throughout society to implement the approaches in the Framework. The AI RMF is designed to equip organizations and individuals – AI actors – with approaches that increase the trustworthiness of AI systems. [...] 3. AI RMF 1.0 Profiles. Profiles are a primary method for organizations to share real-life examples of how they put the AI RMF into practice. These profiles can be for a given industry sector (such as hiring, criminal justice, lending), cross-sectoral (such as large language models, cloud-based services or acquisition), temporal (such as current vs desired state), or other topics. Organizations and individuals are encouraged to jointly or independently produce AI RMF profiles.&quot;,

For the past two years, decision-makers have been inundated with demos of autonomous agents booking flights, writing code, and analyzing data. Yet, the reality on the ground is starkly different.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nested Learning pushes the same theme from another angle. It treats a model as a set of nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, and uses that framing to address catastrophic forgetting. [...] Continual learning shifts rigor toward memory provenance and retention. World models shift it toward robust simulation and prediction of real-world events. Orchestration shifts it toward better use of resources. Refinement shifts it toward smart reflection and correction of answers.\n\nThe winners will not only pick strong models, they will build the control plane that keeps those models correct, current, and cost-efficient.\n\n## More [...] Refinement techniques turn “one answer” into a controlled process: propose, critique, revise, and verify.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The rise of AI is understandably unsettling for workers. But new research from the McKinsey Global Institute shows its impact is far more complicated—and far less alarming—than the headlines imply. According to the study, existing technologies could automate tasks that make up more than half of U.S. work hours today. It’s a big number, but it does not translate into a wholesale disappearance of jobs. Instead, most of the change will come from people doing different things in their workday. The [...] There’s no doubt that some jobs will shrink in the AI age. Others will expand or change, and new ones will emerge. The transition will be challenging for workers and businesses. But organizations that help people build the skills needed to work with AI will capture far more value than those that simply deploy new tools.\n\nAI will transform tasks. But human work will endure. The companies that succeed will invest in their people as a core asset, not just in technology. [...] AI absorbs more chores like sifting information, organizing data and drafting basic content, workers will have to lean more heavily on the capabilities machines do not yet offer: judgment, relationship-building, critical thinking and empathy.&quot;,

Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices. [...] Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures: For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences.

We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed [...] Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;World Labs, a new startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, takes a slightly different approach. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots. [...] There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building Genie, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and [...] JEPA models are much more efficient than generative models, which makes them suitable for fast-paced real-time AI applications that need to run on resource constrained devices. V-JEPA, the video version of the architecture, is pre-trained on unlabeled internet-scale video to learn world models through observation. It then adds a small amount of interaction data from robot trajectories to support planning. That combination hints at a path where enterprises leverage abundant passive video&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Oz Wiki\nOz Wiki\n\n# Gugu and the Kalidahs\n\n\&quot;Gugu and the Kalidahs\&quot; is a non-canonical Oz story written by Eric Shanower, published in Oz-story Magazine No. 1 in 1995. It was reprinted in The Salt Sorcerer of Oz and Other Stories. The story is in the genre of animal fable that was a favorite of L. Frank Baum and often employed by him. [...] Gugu, the ruler of his forest, learns that renegade kalidahs from the east have penetrated his territory. The kalidahs&#x27; lands are adjacent to his own, but jungle law forbids trespassing in either direction. At great risk to himself, Gugu consults with the kalidah king, who is unwilling to interfere; whether Gugu defeats the renegades or vice versa, the king&#x27;s ends are served. Gugu and his subjects, both the stronger (elephants) and the humbler (gophers), must co-operate to survive and triumph; [...] Shanower draws upon Baum&#x27;s The Magic of Oz (1919) for his inspiration. Baum introduced the Forest of Gugu and its eponymous ruler in that book. Baum had created kalidahs, fierce creatures with the bodies of bears and the heads of tigers, in his inaugural Oz book \&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (book)\&quot;), but he returned them to action in The Magic of Oz. In bringing the two elements together, Shanower crafts a might-versus-right tale with undertones of cynical realpolitik.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The rise of AI is understandably unsettling for workers. But new research from the McKinsey Global Institute shows its impact is far more complicated—and far less alarming—than the headlines imply. According to the study, existing technologies could automate tasks that make up more than half of U.S. work hours today. It’s a big number, but it does not translate into a wholesale disappearance of jobs. Instead, most of the change will come from people doing different things in their workday. The [...] AI absorbs more chores like sifting information, organizing data and drafting basic content, workers will have to lean more heavily on the capabilities machines do not yet offer: judgment, relationship-building, critical thinking and empathy. [...] Second, pinpoint the skills that workers, and managers in particular, will need to collaborate effectively with AI. These include technical fluency as well as capabilities specific to human-AI interaction: framing problems, overseeing AI outputs, interpreting results, managing exceptions and knowing when to escalate decisions. Success should be measured by how well people and AI create value together, not by the volume of tools deployed.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The rise of AI is understandably unsettling for workers. But new research from the McKinsey Global Institute shows its impact is far more complicated—and far less alarming—than the headlines imply. According to the study, existing technologies could automate tasks that make up more than half of U.S. work hours today. It’s a big number, but it does not translate into a wholesale disappearance of jobs. Instead, most of the change will come from people doing different things in their workday. The [...] AI absorbs more chores like sifting information, organizing data and drafting basic content, workers will have to lean more heavily on the capabilities machines do not yet offer: judgment, relationship-building, critical thinking and empathy. [...] Second, pinpoint the skills that workers, and managers in particular, will need to collaborate effectively with AI. These include technical fluency as well as capabilities specific to human-AI interaction: framing problems, overseeing AI outputs, interpreting results, managing exceptions and knowing when to escalate decisions. Success should be measured by how well people and AI create value together, not by the volume of tools deployed.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Why CIOs must lead AI experimentation, not just govern it. This allowed employees to immediately find ways to incorporate these tools into their daily work, demystifying AI and generating genuine enthusiasm. ## **Building trust by putting AI in employees&#x27; hands**. Waiting for AI technologies to fully mature means missing critical opportunities to inject new energy and innovation into our companies. The key to successful AI adoption is fostering a culture of learning and experimentation. Employees at all levels, whether developers or non-developers, executives or individual contributors, must have the opportunity to get their hands on AI tools and understand how they work. Some companies are having employees train AI models and learn prompt engineering, which is a fantastic way to remove the mystery and show people how AI truly functions. That’s the feeling we want our employees to have with AI — a tool that makes their work faster, better and, ultimately, more meaningful and joyful.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Continual learning addresses one of the key challenges of current AI models: teaching them new information and skills without destroying their existing knowledge (often referred to as “catastrophic forgetting”). World models promise to give AI systems the ability to understand their environments without the need for human-labeled data or human-generated text. More importantly, world models open the way for AI systems that can move beyond text and solve tasks that involve physical environments. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots. Another approach is to train a specialized orchestrator model that can divide labor between different components of the AI system. So as we continue to see advances in frontier models, we can expect orchestration frameworks to evolve and help enterprises build robust and resource-efficient agentic applications.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;SnapLogic Intelligent Integration Platform (IIP) is a leading iPaaS that empowers business and IT teams to quickly and intuitively move data in and out of Amazon Redshift to surface critical business insights that drive better decisions. The SnapLogic generative integration platform simplifies the onboarding process for Amazon Redshift, DynamoDB, SQS, and Relational Database Services (RDS) customers. I like that SnapLogic Intelligent Integration Platform (IIP) simplifies complex integrations, especially with its drag-and-drop design and ready-to-use connectors, which make building pipelines quick and require minimal coding while still handling large enterprise-level data smoothly. SnapLogic provides a unified, intelligent, and user-friendly platform that makes complex data and application integration faster and more accessible for modern enterprises. Our main use case for SnapLogic is building integration pipelines across SaaS applications, databases, and internal systems to automate the data flows. A specific example of how we have used SnapLogic to automate a particular data flow is leveraging its drag-and-drop pipeline builder and pre-built snaps to build complex integrations in a simplified manner.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;From high-end to high-security | Deloitte Global&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To start transforming its security posture for new realities, the luxury goods maker enlisted the help of Deloitte’s OT Cybersecurity services to begin mapping out its future. Creating a solid OT security policy and reference architecture was the first step toward building a more secure environment and guiding future decisions about new OT or IT assets. To jumpstart the transformation, Deloitte employed Factory Accelerated Security Transformation (FAST), its proven combination of technology and implementation that is designed to rapidly improve cybersecurity and fortify infrastructure within OT environments. After helping to create a robust security policy and reference architecture as the foundation, Deloitte supported the company on automated asset discovery and business process inventory. Doing so helped the manufacturer understand its current OT environment and how various assets connected with other assets and systems—crucial for understanding interdependencies and risks, and for business continuity planning. Improved OT asset discovery and network security help the client prevent cyberattacks and protect operations.&quot;,

FLUX.2 Turbo is a distilled version of the original FLUX.2 [dev] model, which was released by German AI startup Black Forest Labs (formed by ex-Stability AI engineers) last month to provide a best-in-class, open source image generation alternative to the likes of Google&#x27;s Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Image) and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT Image 1.5 (which launched afterwards, but still stands as a competitor today). Thus, if a business wants to use FLUX.2 [dev] Turbo to generate images for commercial purposes — including marketing, product visuals, or customer-facing applications — they should use it through fal’s commercial API or website.&quot;,

As Grok’s enterprise suite debuts, its public-facing deployment is under fire for enabling — and at times posting — non-consensual, AI-generated image manipulations involving women, influencers, and minors. The new **Enterprise Vault** is available as an add on exclusively for Grok Enterprise customers, and introduces physical and logical isolation from xAI’s consumer infrastructure. xAI’s core message is that Grok Enterprise and Business tiers are isolated, with customer data protected and interactions governed by strict access policies. Grok’s X chatbot appears to be a totally separate product, but while it generates headlines about CSAM risks and sexualized edits of public figures, enterprise adoption becomes a branding liability as much as a tooling question.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Open source Qwen-Image-2512 launches to compete with Google&#x27;s Nano Banana Pro in high quality AI image generation. Alibaba’s Qwen team of AI researchers — already having a banner year with numerous powerful open source AI model releases — is now answering with its own alternative, **Qwen-Image-2512**, once again available freely for developers and even large enterprises for commercial purposes under a standard, permissive Apache 2.0 license. In blind, human-evaluated testing on Alibaba’s AI Arena, Qwen-Image-2512 ranks as the strongest open-source image model and remains competitive with closed systems, reinforcing its claim as a production-ready option rather than a research preview. For teams that prefer managed inference, Qwen-Image-2512 is available via Alibaba Cloud Model Studio as qwen-image-max, priced at $0.075 per generated image. The release of Qwen-Image-2512 reinforces a broader shift: open-source AI is no longer content to trail proprietary systems by a generation. Qwen-Image-2512 shows that enterprises now have a serious open-source alternative—one that aligns performance with cost control, governance, and deployment choice.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In order to grasp where Workday employees stand with AI usage, the teams leading the EverdayAI initiative started by gathering data.\n\nThrough this exercise to have next steps on the adoption journey backed by data, the team discovered that 43% of Workday employees said they lacked sufficient time to explore AI and more than a third of employees expressed uncertainty about how to use these new tools. [...] Workday&#x27;s success with its EverydayAI initiative offers a powerful blueprint: AI adoption is fundamentally about people.\n\nBy acknowledging human concerns, fostering a culture of exploration, and actively supporting skill development, organizations can bridge the usage gap and unlock the immense potential of AI.\n\nThe future of work with AI isn&#x27;t one of replacement, but of enhancement, where human ingenuity, empowered by intelligent tools, drives unprecedented productivity and innovation. [...] With a goal to increase AI usage by 20% at the beginning of the year, the team was thrilled to learn that 79% of employees are leveraging AI at present thanks to these initiatives. In other words, almost four times the initial goal was achieved in just over 6 months.\n\nTools range from Workday’s own AI chatbot Workday Assistant, to AI features from vendors including Zoom, Google, and Slack and generative AI-specific tools, AI adoption is now well underway at Workday.\n\n# AI’s Silver Lining&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally. A working day could be the same as that, but is perhaps more often used for the hours of the day you&#x27;re at work. If something happens during the working day, it happens between 9 and 5.30 or whenever.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally. A working day could be the same as that, but is perhaps more often used for the hours of the day you&#x27;re at work. If something happens during the working day, it happens between 9 and 5.30 or whenever. My working day was busy yesterday.\n\nS\n\n#### sasmith\n\n##### Member\n\nBritish English\n\n #5 [...] You are using an out of date browser.

Mistral priced the technology aggressively at $2 per 1,000 pages — with a 50% discount for batch processing — dramatically undercutting many established enterprise document processing solutions.\n\nMichael Nuñez\n\n## AI agents fail 63% of the time on complex tasks. Patronus AI says its new &#x27;living&#x27; training worlds can fix that. [...] The enterprise AI market is currently nursing a massive hangover. For the past two years, decision-makers have been inundated with demos of autonomous agents booking flights, writing code, and analyzing data. Yet, the reality on the ground is starkly different. While experimentation is at an all-time high, deployment of reliable, autonomous agents in production remains challenging.\n\nBen Dickson\n\n## VB Daily\n\nThe insights you need without the noise&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At VentureBeat, we are tracking AI research that can help understand where the practical implementation of technology is heading. We are looking forward to breakthroughs that are not just about the raw intelligence of a single model, but about how we engineer the systems around them. As we approach 2026, here are four trends that can represent the blueprint for the next generation of robust, scalable enterprise applications.\n\n## Continual learning [...] There are now multiple frameworks that create orchestration layers to improve efficiency and accuracy of AI agents, especially when using external tools. Stanford&#x27;s OctoTools is an open-source framework that can orchestrate multiple tools without the need to fine-tune or adjust the models. OctoTools uses a modular approach that plans a solution, selects tools, and passes subtasks to different agents. OctoTools can use any general-purpose LLM as its backbone. [...] There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building Genie, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Has laid off between 60 and 80 employees, citing artificial intelligence as one of the factors behind the decision, TechCrunch reported. The cybersecurity firm, which builds an AI-powered threat detection and response platform, employs roughly 250 people.\n\n### Axonius\n\nIs reportedly cutting roughly 10% of its staff, notifying employees in early November that about 100 of its 900 workers will be laid off. The New York–based cybersecurity firm says the move aims to streamline operations. [...] Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports.\n\n### Rivian [...] Has laid off at least 100 employees, including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July.\n\n### xAI&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;And &#x27;workday&#x27; is meaningless when one is retired and on vacation and thus more likely to visit a museum on a Thursday morning, when all working folk are at work. [...] \&quot;Workday\&quot; and \&quot;working day\&quot; are theoretically possible. But in reality a museum wouldn&#x27;t use those words in the listing of the hours when it&#x27;s open. Visitors who are not native speakers would be much more likely to be confused by the word &#x27;workday&#x27; (which is probably not easily found in the average English phrase book) than by &#x27;Monday&#x27;, which is more easily found. [...] This system is also used to determine bus schedules and, in big cities, when you have to move your car to the other side of the road for the street sweepers.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hiring has always been a high-volume and high-pressure function where delays and mismatches are costly. AI agents for HR are now helping talent teams execute hiring strategies at speed and scale without compromising quality. Agents can screen applications against job descriptions, identify strong candidates, and even schedule interviews without human input. [...] Agents are the newest AI tool transforming the business world, and human resources (HR) is at the forefront. Across industries and use cases, Newsweek says AI agents are \&quot;most mature\&quot; in recruiting, citing key applications like applicant skills matching, job description generation, skills architecture, and HR service support.\n\nBut with HR at the center of workforce management and people strategy, what does it mean for AI agents to be acting with limited human oversight? [...] When deployed properly, AI agents open up capacity for HR teams to be more strategic and build better relationships. Agents can handle the administrative load without requiring constant oversight, which allows HR professionals to focus on more complex, human-centric responsibilities like coaching, retention, and culture. In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally.

[...] The ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an AI bot could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data—including voice messages, text, and technical specifications—to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an AI agent can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024.

It even follows up to make sure the customer is happy. And the best part? AI agents learn from every interaction, helping you spot patterns and improve over time. That essentially means fewer complaints [...] ## Ready to Uplevel Your Service?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To cross the last mile of enterprise AI, agents must be able to reason through complexity, operate on trusted business data, and execute critical actions deterministically. Remove any one of these, and the system breaks down. Combine all three, and AI agents become something enterprises can trust to scale and grow their businesses in ways never before possible. [...] These three pillars ensure that agents use language models to understand intent and context, then execute critical actions through deterministic logic that ensures policies are followed exactly. The result is AI agents that can reason creatively without being allowed to guess when the stakes are high. [...] Williams-Sonoma, Inc. are deploying AI agents into real workflows to drive outcomes that matter: higher sales productivity, faster resolutions, and conversion rates that impact the bottom line.&quot;,
