Integration, operational risk, and leadership buy-in define the agenda. Deloitte’s Workday teams must move quickly to operationalize orchestration, accelerate risk mitigation, and embed agent lifecycle services in transformational blueprints.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Workday Prism Analytics—Deeper AI Integration and Data Governance</strong> (2026-02-15)<br><p><a href="https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/datasheets/datasheet-workday-prism-analytics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Prism Analytics</a> now supports direct agentic AI integrations, enhanced data privacy, and compliance guardrails for sensitive analytic workflows. Deloitte can unleash new value streams as clients use predictive agents with granular access control and auditable logic atop distributed HR and finance data.</p></li>

<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>This week marked a concrete shift from exploratory agentic AI deployments to broad operationalization in SaaS HR and finance ecosystems. Workday’s launch of its Agent System of Record reshapes the control narrative, moving Workday ahead in the race to offer enterprise-grade agent governance. Combined with Prism’s reinforced agentic integration and privacy features, the entire value chain—users, integrators, consultants—now faces heightened demands for lifecycle management, audit, and multi-tenant orchestration. Reports and guidance from Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC mark a consensus: agentic architectures demand mature, layered controls, new operating models, and strong multidisciplinary engagement. Platform vendors are deepening their orchestration stacks (Salesforce Agentforce, SAP Joule, Oracle Innovation Studios), signaling that the battle will shift to interoperability, governance, and value realization. Deloitte’s Workday practice must proactively lead on composability, risk mitigation, and business-aligned agentic services, while aligning with regulatory winds and shifting client expectations on transparency.</p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/events/webinars/agentforce-voice-whats-new-whats-coming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agentforce Voice</a> expands orchestration and voice-based collaboration—setting a high bar for workflow automation. Deloitte should help clients build bridges across UX and outcome domains, integrating agentic models from both Salesforce and Workday for unified value.</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-recognized-as-a-leader-2025-gartner-mq-financial-planning-software-2026-02-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Magic Quadrant leadership</a> and expansion of its Innovation Studios put Oracle in contention for large-scale agent orchestration credibility. Deloitte can leverage platform-agnostic accelerators and reference architectures to maintain parity for clients weighing Oracle vs. Workday vs. SAP.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP:</strong> <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-a2a-connect-code-based-agents-into-joule/ba-p/14329279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joule</a> enables robust agentic connections and new ABAP AI guides (<a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/the-future-of-sap-abap-based-systems-with-ai-why-mcp-servers-matter/ba-p/14328845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see ABAP perspective</a>).

Deloitte and other GSIs must position for value co-creation, robust governance, and orchestration as clients demand more autonomy—and more accountability—in their HR stacks.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday&#x27;s Agentic System of Record Now Generally Available (2026-02-19)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced general availability of its Agent System of Record, enabling enterprises to centrally manage, audit, and govern the full lifecycle of AI agents within the Workday platform. This system brings unprecedented observability, version control, and compliance alignment for agent-driven HR and finance processes. For customers, it means less risk of &#x27;agent sprawl&#x27;—the proliferation of unsanctioned or redundant autonomous agents. It further equips CIOs and HR leaders to meet new regulatory mandates around auditability and transparency. For Deloitte’s Workday customers, the release unlocks professionalization of agent operations, shifting the focus from bespoke deployments to platform-aligned, scalable, and governable AI-driven processes. This will inform new offerings in agent governance diagnostics, operating model redesign, and assurance services. \\n\\nThis is a pivotal advance for both Workday and its ecosystem, formalizing a control layer that SAP and Oracle have only hinted at.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/managing-ai-powered-future-of-work.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte Reports on the State of AI in the Enterprise (2026-02-18)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte’s annual report underscores a maturation in enterprise AI adoption, especially regarding agentic models and orchestration in SaaS applications. Key takeaways: 74% of surveyed organizations are piloting or deploying agentic AI, up from 55% in 2025; 69% cite improved employee experience via autonomous workflows; but 61% struggle with governance and integration complexity. The study highlights platform-level advancements (like Workday’s) but warns against fragmentation if vendors resist open orchestration standards. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these trends reinforce the urgency of investing in orchestration, integration accelerators, and AI management frameworks. Clients expect more than new features—they expect a roadmap for responsible, resilient transformation. Deloitte can lead by integrating these findings into client conversations and solution blueprints.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/issues/generative-ai/state-of-ai-in-enterprise.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Prism Analytics—Deeper AI Integration and Data Governance (2026-02-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday released an updated Prism Analytics product datasheet outlining new agentic AI integrations, enhanced data lineage tracking, and improved privacy governance for cross-functional analytics. These enhancements allow organizations to deploy predictive agents directly on sensitive workforce and financial data, with robust guardrails for compliance and permissioning. For clients, this means faster time-to-value from AI without compromising data privacy or regulatory alignment. For Deloitte, this accelerates opportunities to deploy next-generation analytics, helping clients unify disparate datasets, embed AI agents in analytic workflows, and scale value realization across HR and finance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/datasheets/datasheet-workday-prism-analytics.pdf\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG Whitepaper: Risk Management for Agentic Corporate Services (2026-02-17)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG released a comprehensive whitepaper focused on risk management strategies for agentic AI in corporate services. The document provides practical frameworks for monitoring, auditing, and remediating agent-driven processes in domains from HR to finance, emphasizing the blending of automated controls and human oversight. The report signals a consensus among major advisories: agentic architectures, while powerful, introduce novel risk vectors that require more than technical fixes—organizational controls and cultural adaptation are essential. For Deloitte, this validates the need to offer integrated risk services for agentic deployments, from initial integration through ongoing assurance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2026/02/ai-in-risk-management.pdf\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;PwC Reveals Agentic AI Operationalization and Spreadsheet Reasoning Agent Release (2026-02-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;PwC’s latest update details live agentic AI use cases in spreadsheet reasoning and decision automation, linking its launch to a broader architecture for enterprise-grade agent stewardship. Their agent handles multi-sheet financial models, ingesting, validating, and analyzing data with traceable logic and interactive oversight. PwC stresses not just technical potential but the operational and ethical scaffolding required to bring agentic AI into high-stakes business contexts. This bolsters arguments for &#x27;agent observability&#x27; and highlights the need for strong SLA-backed engagements.

This ensures compliance, transparency, and less risk of agent proliferation. For Deloitte’s Workday clients, it enables the shift to professional, scalable, and compliant agent operations technologies.\\n\\n- Deloitte Reports on the State of AI in the Enterprise (2026-02-18): Deloitte’s AI report (https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/issues/generative-ai/state-of-ai-in-enterprise.html) shows rapid enterprise adoption of agentic AI, with 74% piloting or deploying. Integration and governance are rising pain points, highlighting the need for robust orchestration and lifecycle management—areas where Deloitte can excel for Workday clients.\\n\\n- Workday Prism Analytics—Deeper AI Integration and Data Governance (2026-02-15): Workday Prism Analytics (https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/datasheets/datasheet-workday-prism-analytics.pdf) now supports advanced agentic integrations, data lineage, and privacy controls, allowing predictive HR/finance agent deployments at enterprise scale—opening new consulting value for data and AI integration.\\n\\n- KPMG Whitepaper: Risk Management for Agentic Corporate Services (2026-02-17): KPMG’s whitepaper (https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2026/02/ai-in-risk-management.pdf) focuses on managing new risks from agentic automation in HR and finance services. For Deloitte, integrated risk services in agentic programs are more critical than ever.\\n\\n- PwC Reveals Agentic AI Operationalization and Spreadsheet Reasoning Agent Release (2026-02-16): PwC’s agent (https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/pwc-ai-spreadsheet-reasoning-agent.html) automates multi-sheet financial analysis with clear oversight and traceable logic—underlining the need for agent observability in all agentic business efforts.\\n\\nWhat changed this week: Concrete operationalization of agentic AI took root, with Workday raising the governance bar and risk/consulting leaders converging on layered control frameworks. Ecosystems shifted focus from features to compliance, lifecycle, and orchestration, with Deloitte poised to lead with composable, risk-managed solutions.\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- Salesforce: Agentforce Voice (https://www.salesforce.com/events/webinars/agentforce-voice-whats-new-whats-coming) brings new orchestration and UI leadership. Deloitte should address cross-vendor agent integration and value.\\n- Oracle: Gartner MQ leader and Innovation Studios (https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-recognized-as-a-leader-2025-gartner-mq-financial-planning-software-2026-02-19) position it as a credible alternative for agent management at scale; Deloitte must match parity with platform-agnostic integration.\\n- SAP: Joule agentic architecture (https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-a2a-connect-code-based-agents-into-joule/ba-p/14329279) and ABAP AI guidance (https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/the-future-of-sap-abap-based-systems-with-ai-why-mcp-servers-matter/ba-p/14328845) increase the agent orchestration race.
