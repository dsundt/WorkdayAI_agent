<h3>What changed this week</h3>

PwC’s global AI agent push, directly involving Workday and bolstered by Google Cloud, emphasizes that the competitive landscape for HR/Finance automation is intensifying. For Deloitte, the key change is the convergence of client demand, technological readiness, and escalating SI/GSI innovation cycles, requiring even more agile, evidence-based, and differentiated advisory approaches.</p>
