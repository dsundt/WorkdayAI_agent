With Pipedream’s low-code orchestration of 1,000+ apps, Workday clients can rapidly compose agent-enabled workflows across HR, finance, and other SaaS environments. For Deloitte, this broadens delivery scope—requiring new solution accelerators and advisory approaches on agent extensibility and interoperability.</p></li><li><b>Workday Expands Open Ecosystem with Global Developer Network, Google BigQuery Partnership (Nov 19, 2025)</b><br><p>In <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Its-Open-Ecosystem-with-New-Global-Developer-Network-and-Google-BigQuery-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this announcement</a>, Workday opened its platform for external agent developers, significantly increasing the breadth and speed of agentic solutions. Integration with Google BigQuery allows organizations—especially those already invested in Google Cloud—to blend Workday data with their analytics infrastructure for richer agentic automation. Deloitte should leverage these platforms to co-design industry-specific solutions aligned with client data strategies.</p></li><li><b>Workday Launches EU Sovereign Cloud for AI: Full Data Residency and Control (Nov 19, 2025)</b><br><p>The new <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Launches-Workday-EU-Sovereign-Cloud-to-Unlock-Enterprise-AI-With-Full-EU-Data-Residency-and-Control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU Sovereign Cloud</a> empowers European organizations to harness agentic AI in compliance with strict data privacy laws. For regulated industries, this is a unique selling point and a compliance safeguard. Deloitte’s practices must prioritize data residency requirements, using this offering as a differentiator in EU bids and engagements.</p></li><li><b>Microsoft and Workday Deepen Collaboration on Agentic AI Workforce Management (Nov 20, 2025)</b><br><p><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday and Microsoft’s alliance</a> leverages Azure AI and Copilot frameworks for streamlined, governed management of digital coworkers.

This shifts buyer expectations toward explainable, cross-app agent workflows and forces Deloitte practitioners to develop differentiated solution frameworks highlighting extensibility and assured compliance.</p></li><li><b>Workday Expands Workday GO: SMBs Get All-in-One AI-Powered SaaS (Nov 19, 2025)</b><br><p><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Workday-GO,-the-All-in-One-Workday-for-All-Solution,-to-Support-Businesses-of-All-Sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday GO’s</a> expansion democratizes access to agentic AI automation for SMBs. Deloitte can now offer packaged transformations for midmarket clients, creating new service lines and ecosystem partnerships, especially in segments where competitors have already been active.</p></li></ul><h3>What changed this week</h3><p>This week’s announcements signal a step-change in agentic AI strategies for SaaS, especially in HCM and ERP sectors. Workday’s convergence of acquisitions, platform openness, and regulatory compliance defines a playbook for large-scale, multi-agent automation. Competitors intensified the ‘agent wars’ with sweeping feature parity, while ecosystem partnerships—integration (Pipedream), cloud (BigQuery), and cross-stack governance (Microsoft)—suggest end-users will look increasingly for seamless, compliant, and interoperable AI workflows. For Deloitte, richer solution architecture, rapid enablement, and differentiated regulatory guidance emerged as imperatives.</p><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><b>Microsoft:</b> <i>Unveiled Agent 365 for agent management and governance.</i> <br>Microsoft’s new control plane for agents offers a blueprint for unified agent orchestration in large enterprises.

Leading SaaS/HCM/ERP vendors, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and UKG, escalated agent-driven automation, reshaping expectations for enterprise clients and platform delivery partners.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Signs Agreement to Acquire Pipedream to Extend AI Agent Integrations (Nov 19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s definitive agreement to acquire Pipedream underscores a strategic effort to make its platform the central nervous system for agent-driven integrations across the enterprise SaaS landscape. Pipedream’s platform is known for low-code, scalable integration with 1,000+ SaaS services, making it uniquely positioned to orchestrate agentic data flows at scale. For Workday customers, this dramatically accelerates the time-to-value for agent-powered automation, spanning HR, Finance, and third-party apps. For Deloitte’s Workday clients, the integration landscape is poised to become more extensible, demanding rearchitected delivery roadmaps and new co-innovation accelerators that capitalize on agentic interoperability.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Pipedream\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Expands Open Ecosystem with Global Developer Network, Google BigQuery Partnership (Nov 19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced a sweeping open ecosystem strategy, launching a Global Developer Network and integration with Google BigQuery. This bold play positions Workday as the most open enterprise SaaS cloud for agent developers—enabling enterprises and GSIs to create, test, and deploy agentic solutions with unprecedented connectivity and data accessibility. The BigQuery tie-in enhances Workday’s analytics fabric, letting organizations layer agentic AI atop financial and HR datasets. For Deloitte, this trend reinforces the importance of data engineering and opens partnership opportunities to co-innovate on the Workday platform, as enterprise clients seek tailored agentic solutions deeply integrated with their broader cloud data estates.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Its-Open-Ecosystem-with-New-Global-Developer-Network-and-Google-BigQuery-Partnership\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Launches EU Sovereign Cloud for AI: Full Data Residency and Control (Nov 19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s new EU Sovereign Cloud directly addresses intensifying regulatory scrutiny around AI, privacy, and data sovereignty in the EMEA market. By securing full European data residency and independent operational controls, Workday positions itself as the premier HCM/Finance SaaS provider for privacy-sensitive sectors. For Deloitte’s European engagements, the offering is a key lever to win regulated customers while futureproofing client architectures. This move also sets a new benchmark, placing regulatory-compliant AI at the heart of competitive differentiation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Launches-Workday-EU-Sovereign-Cloud-to-Unlock-Enterprise-AI-With-Full-EU-Data-Residency-and-Control\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft and Workday Deepen Collaboration on Agentic AI Workforce Management (Nov 20, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;New coverage in CIO details renewed commitments from Microsoft and Workday to co-manage agentic AI workers, leveraging the Microsoft Copilot and Azure AI platforms. The partnership focuses on facilitating centralized governance and collaborative workflows for agentic ‘digital coworkers’ in HR and Finance. This strengthens Workday’s position within the Microsoft-dominated enterprise stack and signals to integrators like Deloitte that future Workday client architectures will increasingly require joint Azure + Workday patterns for agent orchestration and governance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Doubles Down on AI Agents in Workforce Management (Nov 20, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle announced major advances in AI-powered workforce management, introducing new agentic features for its HCM suite. The update focuses on end-to-end employee lifecycle automation, dynamic agentic scheduling, and improved conversational interfaces. This announcement comes as Oracle aims to counter Workday’s surge in AI-centric product evolution. For Deloitte’s Oracle and Workday practices, the need to differentiate agent design philosophy, integration strategy, and client outcomes is intensifying, as buyers compare maturity, ecosystem reach, and compliance rigor across platforms.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/oracle-leads-with-excellence-in-workforce-management-innovation-2025-11-20\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;UKG and Dayforce Release New Agentic AI Features (Nov 19-21, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;UKG launched Bryte AI Agents for transforming employee experience, and Dayforce rolled out AI agents aimed at streamlining administrative work across HR operations. These coordinated launches signify rapid commoditization of AI agentic features in the HRIS market, pressuring all vendors to offer deeper extensibility, open connectors, and explainable, safe automation. Deloitte’s multi-vendor clients will see growing interest in agent interoperability, risk management, and accelerated deployment for real-world business process change.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Expands Workday GO: Aiming at SMBs with All-in-One AI-Powered SaaS (Nov 19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s announcement of Workday GO expansion marks a move to democratize agentic AI for small and midsize businesses. Offering simplified deployment, preconfigured agentic modules, and lower TCO, this initiative signals Workday’s intent to win greenfield market share and counter recent AI-powered offerings from Salesforce, Oracle, and others targeting the midmarket. For Deloitte, this creates new opportunities—and competitive urgency—around packaged deployment accelerators, managed services, and outcome-based pricing in the SMB tier.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Workday-GO,-the-All-in-One-Workday-for-All-Solution,-to-Support-Businesses-of-All-Sizes\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Unveiled Agent 365 as a centralized control plane for managing AI agents across the enterprise.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft’s Agent 365 helps clients govern, orchestrate, and secure agentic workloads at scale, signaling a shift from individual copilot deployments to standardized agent management. For Deloitte, this raises the bar for agent governance consulting, especially for joint Workday + Microsoft deployments where agentic workflows must be transparent, compliant, and secure.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced a major update to its workforce management suite, featuring new agentic AI capabilities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s acceleration in agent-driven automation positions it directly against Workday’s platform-first agentic extensibility, intensifying buyer scrutiny on breadth, depth, and openness of AI ecosystems. This calls for Deloitte differentiation in integration strategy and regulatory compliance.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP (Joule)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Continued enhancements to Joule AI agents for HR and time management, focusing on explainable, embedded workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP is moving to embed standardized agentic patterns, emphasizing audit trails and responsible AI.

For Deloitte, this broadens delivery scope—requiring new solution accelerators and advisory approaches on agent extensibility and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workday Expands Open Ecosystem with Global Developer Network, Google BigQuery Partnership (Nov 19, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Its-Open-Ecosystem-with-New-Global-Developer-Network-and-Google-BigQuery-Partnership\\\&quot;&gt;this announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Workday opened its platform for external agent developers, significantly increasing the breadth and speed of agentic solutions. Integration with Google BigQuery allows organizations—especially those already invested in Google Cloud—to blend Workday data with their analytics infrastructure for richer agentic automation. Deloitte should leverage these platforms to co-design industry-specific solutions aligned with client data strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workday Launches EU Sovereign Cloud for AI: Full Data Residency and Control (Nov 19, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Launches-Workday-EU-Sovereign-Cloud-to-Unlock-Enterprise-AI-With-Full-EU-Data-Residency-and-Control\\\&quot;&gt;EU Sovereign Cloud&lt;/a&gt; empowers European organizations to harness agentic AI in compliance with strict data privacy laws. For regulated industries, this is a unique selling point and a compliance safeguard. Deloitte’s practices must prioritize data residency requirements, using this offering as a differentiator in EU bids and engagements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft and Workday Deepen Collaboration on Agentic AI Workforce Management (Nov 20, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html\\\&quot;&gt;Workday and Microsoft’s alliance&lt;/a&gt; leverages Azure AI and Copilot frameworks for streamlined, governed management of digital coworkers. As agent orchestration becomes standard in HR and finance workflows, clients expect confident, unified approaches to agent governance—placing a premium on delivery partners with cross-cloud expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oracle Doubles Down on AI Agents in Workforce Management (Nov 20, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle’s &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/oracle-leads-with-excellence-in-workforce-management-innovation-2025-11-20\\\&quot;&gt;release of advanced agentic AI features&lt;/a&gt; in its HCM suite points to increasing platform-level competition. Their focus on full lifecycle automation and conversational agents challenges Deloitte’s Workday practice to sharpen client ROI narratives and embrace robust multi-vendor integration playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UKG and Dayforce Release New Agentic AI Features (Nov 19-21, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKG’s new &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite\\\&quot;&gt;Bryte AI Agents&lt;/a&gt; and Dayforce’s updated AI assistants mark the rapid proliferation of agent-centric HR automation. This shifts buyer expectations toward explainable, cross-app agent workflows and forces Deloitte practitioners to develop differentiated solution frameworks highlighting extensibility and assured compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workday Expands Workday GO: SMBs Get All-in-One AI-Powered SaaS (Nov 19, 2025)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Expands-Workday-GO,-the-All-in-One-Workday-for-All-Solution,-to-Support-Businesses-of-All-Sizes\\\&quot;&gt;Workday GO’s&lt;/a&gt; expansion democratizes access to agentic AI automation for SMBs. Deloitte can now offer packaged transformations for midmarket clients, creating new service lines and ecosystem partnerships, especially in segments where competitors have already been active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What changed this week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s announcements signal a step-change in agentic AI strategies for SaaS, especially in HCM and ERP sectors. Workday’s convergence of acquisitions, platform openness, and regulatory compliance defines a playbook for large-scale, multi-agent automation. Competitors intensified the ‘agent wars’ with sweeping feature parity, while ecosystem partnerships—integration (Pipedream), cloud (BigQuery), and cross-stack governance (Microsoft)—suggest end-users will look increasingly for seamless, compliant, and interoperable AI workflows. For Deloitte, richer solution architecture, rapid enablement, and differentiated regulatory guidance emerged as imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unveiled Agent 365 for agent management and governance.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;Microsoft’s new control plane for agents offers a blueprint for unified agent orchestration in large enterprises. The move will push Workday deployments—and Deloitte delivery teams—to incorporate cross-stack agent audit and compliance patterns alongside business process transformation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oracle:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Advanced agentic AI for HCM.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;Oracle’s innovation underscores the need for Deloitte to demonstrate unique speed, compliance, and measurable outcomes for Workday clients as buyers judge platforms head-to-head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAP (Joule):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Grew explainable agentic workflows for core HR.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;SAP’s focus on responsible agentic automation broadens the risk/benefit calculus for Deloitte’s SAP and Workday clients, driving new advisory requirements on governance and cross-vendor integrations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;UKG &amp; Dayforce:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Released new AI agents for HR.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;This trend clarifies that agentic automation is now a baseline buyer expectation, shifting competition to deployment speed, integration fabric, and risk-managed change management, where Deloitte must lead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enablement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agentic AI Integration &amp;
