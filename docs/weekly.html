As digital transformation roadmaps grow more complex with agentic AI, this recognition reassures both new and existing customers, driving enterprise adoption and reinforcing the partner ecosystem. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, KLAS credibility can be leveraged in RFPs, client pitches, and renewal negotiations to demonstrate proven value and future readiness.</p></li><li><strong>Workday Introduces the Military Skills Mapper for Veteran Hiring (2026-02-03)</strong> <br><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-03-Workday-Introduces-the-Military-Skills-Mapper-to-Help-Organizations-Better-Recognize-and-Hire-Veteran-Talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full release</a>. <br><p>Workday’s new feature uses agentic AI to translate military experience into civilian workforce skills, advancing diversity and compliance. With increasing competition for high-quality talent, Deloitte can use this differentiator to advise clients on sustainable, inclusive hiring processes and demonstrate tangible impacts of AI-driven HR transformation.</p></li><li><strong>Cognizant Q4 and FY25 Results Show Agentic AI Momentum (2026-02-04)</strong> <br><a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-04-Cognizant-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial results</a>. <br><p>Cognizant’s report highlights surging client demand for GenAI, digital engineering, and agentic automation solutions. They are gaining ground with rapid deployment, cross-cloud orchestration, and high-talent density across verticals. Deloitte’s differentiation will depend on deeper, faster application of agentic AI in sector-specific journeys and robust value realization for clients seeking comprehensive modernization partners.</p></li><li><strong>Oracle: New Clinical AI Agents and Vertically Aligned AI Innovations for Banking (2026-02-02–03)</strong><br><a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-health-adds-order-creation-capabilities-to-clinical-ai-agent-2026-02-02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthcare AI agents</a>. <br><p>Oracle expands its industry agentic AI focus with launch of clinical agents and new banking solutions. Targeting regulated processes and specialty workflow automation, Oracle is raising the bar for industry specificity. Deloitte should emphasize its cross-solution vendor approach and readiness to support clients on their platform journeys—ensuring risk, controls, and differentiated industry context are always foregrounded.</p></li><li><strong>AI-Fueled Market Volatility Affects SaaS Sector (2026-02-06)</strong><br><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/06/ai-torches-software-stocks-even-investors-fret-ai-factory-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiliconAngle coverage</a>. <br><p>Software stocks saw increased volatility this week as investors scrutinized AI spend and the ‘AI factory’ cost model. For Workday and Deloitte, this amplifies pressure to show quick, measurable AI ROI and to structure engagements that tightly align technical innovation with real-world business value.</p></li></ul><h3>What changed this week</h3><p>This week marked a key inflection for agentic AI in SaaS, as Workday and Oracle doubled down on vertical-specific AI agents—signaling ecosystem maturity and accelerating competition with tailored automations. External market forces (investor scrutiny, rising cost focus, AI feature expectations) have heightened the need for fast ROI, responsible governance, and cross-vendor orchestration. Deloitte’s Workday teams should leverage KLAS recognition, AI-driven HR innovations, and multi-cloud adoption momentum to assure clients of both vision and practicality. However, Cognizant’s and Oracle’s industry moves, paired with SAP’s steady enhancements, demand sustained investment in enablement and adaptive, differentiated services. Ecosystem velocity and new governance imperatives require a renewed focus on collaboration, responsible innovation, and client trust-building.</p><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><strong>Cognizant</strong>: GenAI and agentic AI have driven revenue surge, with focus on outcome-based, industry-specific accelerators.

The award acknowledges continued customer satisfaction, cloud scalability, and the ability to integrate emerging AI capabilities at scale. As agentic AI becomes foundational to HR and finance, accolades from respected analysts should accelerate new enterprise adoption and reinforce renewals, strengthening Deloitte’s Workday implementation, optimization, and managed services pipeline. This sustained market validation enables Deloitte to position its advisory, transformation, and digital enablement practices as trusted partners in future-proofing enterprise clients against competitive disruption.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-04-Workday-Named-Best-in-KLAS-for-ERP-for-Large-Organizations-for-Ninth-Consecutive-Year\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Introduces the Military Skills Mapper to Help Organizations Better Recognize and Hire Veteran Talent (2026-02-03)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s launch of the Military Skills Mapper expands the company’s AI-driven recruitment and talent analytics capabilities. This innovation leverages AI to translate military experience into civilian skills for talent pipelines, strengthening Workday’s value proposition in DEI, compliance, and workforce modernization. The feature reflects a growing focus on inclusion and high-ROI talent acquisition, making Workday more indispensable for mission-critical HR outcomes. Deloitte can harness these features to design more impactful veteran hiring strategies for clients, integrate AI-driven DEI frameworks into HR transformations, and reinforce measurable ESG value.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-03-Workday-Introduces-the-Military-Skills-Mapper-to-Help-Organizations-Better-Recognize-and-Hire-Veteran-Talent\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant Q4 and FY25 Results Signal Strong Demand for GenAI and Digital Solutions (2026-02-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant reported robust Q4 and full-year 2025 results, with notable growth in digital engineering and genAI-enabled services. The firm emphasized a sharp acceleration in demand for agentic AI, workflow automation, and next-gen cloud platforms. For Workday, this signals intensifying partner and competitor investment in agentic AI orchestration and implementation skills. Deloitte must focus on scaling agentic AI proof-of-value, integration accelerators, and responsible AI frameworks, particularly as enterprise clients look for trusted, cross-platform orchestration partners. Cognizant’s strategy and results increase competitive intensity and challenge Deloitte to further distinguish its multidisciplinary edge.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-04-Cognizant-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Advances Agentic AI for Industry, Healthcare, and Banking (2026-02-02 to 2026-02-03)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s announcements around new ‘clinical AI Agents’ and banking modernization reflect a strategic commitment to verticalized agentic AI capabilities. Their new clinical AI agents for Oracle Health, and AI-powered banking solutions, illustrate a pivot toward industry-specific agentic automation—directly challenging Workday’s growing HR/finance agent library and industry modules. Deloitte’s Oracle and Workday teams must monitor accelerated feature parity (e.g., order creation, pre-built industry skills, embedded compliance) and help clients evaluate best-fit platforms for both generic and regulated processes. Cross-vendor advisory and platform neutrality become increasingly important as clients seek ‘composable’ agentic ecosystems.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-health-adds-order-creation-capabilities-to-clinical-ai-agent-2026-02-02\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI-Fueled Market Volatility Puts Pressure on SaaS and Platform Players (2026-02-06)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;This week saw increased software sector volatility, with investors parsing AI cost structures and factory spending across SaaS majors. The sector’s moves suggest downstream pricing shifts, ecosystem consolidation, and a harder focus on ROI for AI/agentic workflows. Workday and Deloitte must help clients justify and realize agentic AI investments’ value, not just feature footprint, and communicate total cost of adoption—including data, governance, and change management. Advisory and transformation practices must balance visionary AI strategy with pragmatic steps and clear business cases to maintain client trust and momentum.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/06/ai-torches-software-stocks-even-investors-fret-ai-factory-spending\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced strong financial results driven by generative and agentic AI solutions.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant&#x27;s success with GenAI-centered delivery for digital transformation highlights a direct challenge to Deloitte’s market position. Their focus on outcome-oriented, cross-cloud agentic AI accelerators and vertical solutions broadens client options for transformation partners. Deloitte must respond by accelerating its own agentic AI offerings, strengthening cross-industry AI governance frameworks, and differentiating with depth in regulatory, risk, and change leadership.

For Deloitte’s Workday practice, KLAS credibility can be leveraged in RFPs, client pitches, and renewal negotiations to demonstrate proven value and future readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Introduces the Military Skills Mapper for Veteran Hiring (2026-02-03)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-03-Workday-Introduces-the-Military-Skills-Mapper-to-Help-Organizations-Better-Recognize-and-Hire-Veteran-Talent\\\&quot;&gt;Full release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workday’s new feature uses agentic AI to translate military experience into civilian workforce skills, advancing diversity and compliance.

They are gaining ground with rapid deployment, cross-cloud orchestration, and high-talent density across verticals.

Targeting regulated processes and specialty workflow automation, Oracle is raising the bar for industry specificity.

For Workday and Deloitte, this amplifies pressure to show quick, measurable AI ROI and to structure engagements that tightly align technical innovation with real-world business value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What changed this week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week marked a key inflection for agentic AI in SaaS, as Workday and Oracle doubled down on vertical-specific AI agents—signaling ecosystem maturity and accelerating competition with tailored automations. External market forces (investor scrutiny, rising cost focus, AI feature expectations) have heightened the need for fast ROI, responsible governance, and cross-vendor orchestration. Deloitte’s Workday teams should leverage KLAS recognition, AI-driven HR innovations, and multi-cloud adoption momentum to assure clients of both vision and practicality. However, Cognizant’s and Oracle’s industry moves, paired with SAP’s steady enhancements, demand sustained investment in enablement and adaptive, differentiated services. Ecosystem velocity and new governance imperatives require a renewed focus on collaboration, responsible innovation, and client trust-building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognizant&lt;/strong&gt;: GenAI and agentic AI have driven revenue surge, with focus on outcome-based, industry-specific accelerators. Deloitte must respond quickly with more verticalized, high-impact agentic use cases that address real client business problems.&lt;br&gt;See: &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-04-Cognizant-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\\\&quot;&gt;Cognizant Q4 and FY25 Results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle&lt;/strong&gt;: Announced new clinical and banking agentic AI, reinforcing vertical capabilities and challenging Workday on regulated markets.

Deloitte’s implementation and advisory offerings can directly capitalize on this reputation with proof-points for value and reliability. https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-04-Workday-Named-Best-in-KLAS-for-ERP-for-Large-Organizations-for-Ninth-Consecutive-Year\\n\\n- Workday Introduces the Military Skills Mapper to Help Organizations Better Recognize and Hire Veteran Talent (2026-02-03): This feature leverages agentic AI to translate military experience into relevant skills for talent pipelines, strengthening Workday’s DEI and compliance edge. For Deloitte, it enhances value-based HR transformations and differentiated ESG advisory. https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-03-Workday-Introduces-the-Military-Skills-Mapper-to-Help-Organizations-Better-Recognize-and-Hire-Veteran-Talent\\n\\n- Cognizant Q4 and FY25 Results Show Agentic AI Momentum (2026-02-04): Strong results indicate surging demand for GenAI, digital engineering, and agentic automation. Cognizant’s delivery capability, speed, and vertical use case focus pose a challenge to Deloitte. Deloitte should accelerate enablement and outcome-driven agentic offerings. https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-04-Cognizant-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\\n\\n- Oracle Advances Agentic AI for Industry, Healthcare, and Banking (2026-02-02 to 2026-02-03): Oracle&#x27;s launch of new clinical AI agents and banking modernization tools signals greater vertical specialization. Deloitte must lead with platform-agnostic, value-based advisory, managing integration and risk as clients explore multi-vendor agentic strategies. https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-health-adds-order-creation-capabilities-to-clinical-ai-agent-2026-02-02\\n\\n- AI-Fueled Market Volatility Affects SaaS Sector (2026-02-06): SaaS and AI stocks became more volatile as investors questioned large-scale AI expenditures. Workday and Deloitte must emphasize clear ROI and value realization in agentic/AI-driven SaaS engagements. https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/06/ai-torches-software-stocks-even-investors-fret-ai-factory-spending\\n\\nWhat changed this week: The SaaS sector has seen a pivot toward vertical and outcome-driven agentic AI, marked by Workday’s intelligent HR innovations, Oracle’s vertical AI push, and intensifying GSI competition (notably Cognizant). With investors scrutinizing AI costs and seeking quick returns, the burden on Deloitte’s advisory and transformation teams is to connect vision to value through responsible, adaptable, and highly differentiated client engagements.\\n\\nCompetitive Watch:\\n- Cognizant: Reporting GenAI-driven growth and focusing on cross-cloud, industry AI accelerators. Deloitte must emphasize outcome-driven agentic transformation and regulatory leadership. https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-04-Cognizant-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\\n- Oracle: Industry-specific (healthcare, banking) AI agent expansion ratchets up competition for regulated clients. Deloitte needs hybrid multi-cloud readiness to help clients navigate cross-platform adoption. https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-health-adds-order-creation-capabilities-to-clinical-ai-agent-2026-02-02\\n- SAP: Incremental workflow, automation, and AI feature updates signal steady investment for platform clients. Deloitte should position differentiated orchestration and integration expertise. https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/bg-p/technology-blog-sap/label-name/product%20updates%E2%80%8B\\n\\nEnablement:\\n- Agentic AI implementation and value realization (IBM): https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5f5af4f532a\\n- Operationalizing GenAI at scale (Deloitte): https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/articles/operationalizing-gen-ai-enterprise-scale.html\\n- Responsible agentic AI governance (EY): https://www.ey.com/en_ca/insights/assurance/technology-risk/six-steps-to-enhance-agentic-ai-governance\\n\\nActions Next Week:\\n- Schedule market intelligence workshops in response to Cognizant/Oracle moves.\\n- Create client assets spotlighting Workday’s KLAS win &amp; Military Skills Mapper.\\n- Update playbooks on Deloitte’s responsible agentic AI deployments.\\n- Align value messaging around AI-driven market volatility.\\n- Continue enablement using IBM, Deloitte, and EY resources above.\\n\\nRisks &amp; Mitigations:\\n- Risk: Feature convergence reduces differentiated value for Workday/Deloitte. Mitigation: Accelerate co-innovation with Workday; focus on unique industry outcomes.\\n- Risk: Speed, hype, and cost drive clients to underinvest in governance. Mitigation: Reinforce risk, compliance, and pragmatic advisory as differentiators.\\n- Risk: Market volatility slows deals.
