<h3>What changed this week</h3>
<p>The week of Feb 7–14, 2026, marked a decided acceleration in both strategic repositioning and practical AI enablement across the SaaS HR/ERP landscape. Workday’s executive transition to Aneel Bhusri as CEO stabilized its strategic direction, with immediate implications for major transformation clients and the broader agentic AI narrative. Regulatory currents intensified, with the US EEOC and European regulators issuing new guidance and enforcement signals on AI fairness, transparency, and auditability—applying heightened pressure to both technology providers and their SI partners.
</p>
<p>Competitively, Oracle doubled down on agentic guardrails and models, while SAP Joule expanded its agent developer ecosystem to prioritize cross-SaaS integration and client-custom automation. At the same time, Workday released customer stories validating agentic ROI, and ServiceNow/Dayforce intensified their own agentic platform and governance messaging. The ecosystem is seeing a clearer split: agentic innovation leadership versus trustworthy, regulatory-aligned operations. Deloitte’s role as an advisor and integrator is increasingly dependent on credible skill in both domains—AI innovation and AI risk governance.</p>

Regulatory focus on AI ethics sharpened, with ecosystem partnerships and platform-driven agentic automation beginning to reshape enterprise strategy and Deloitte&#x27;s Workday offerings.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Reinstates Co-founder Aneel Bhusri as CEO Amid AI Strategic Pivot (2026-02-09)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced that co-founder Aneel Bhusri is returning as CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach. The move comes as the company navigates the rapidly evolving AI and agentic systems landscape. Bhusri&#x27;s leadership is associated with Workday&#x27;s original culture of innovation, and analysts view his return as pivotal for maintaining trust and strategic continuity as Workday accelerates investments in agentic AI for HR and finance. For Deloitte&#x27;s Workday practice, this leadership stabilization offers reassurance to clients considering major platform investments and offers a focal point for recalibrating advisory messaging around Workday’s AI vision and roadmap.\\n\\nThe stock initially dipped over 5% on the announcement, reflecting stakeholder anxieties about executive transitions in a high-stakes technology environment, but Forrester and media coverage emphasize Bhusri&#x27;s success in steering Workday through periods of technological and cultural change. His return is seen as a recommitment to both innovation and responsible AI deployment, especially as the company positions its Data Cloud and Agentic AI capabilities to compete against SAP Joule, Oracle, and emergent agent-driven architectures.\\n\\nSo what for Deloitte: This leadership shift underlines the importance of aligning client engagement strategies with Workday’s evolving agentic AI agenda, ensuring continuity for ongoing transformation projects and leveraging the renewed narrative around Bhusri’s commitment to customer-centric, ethically governed AI advancements.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-09-Workday-Announces-CEO-Transition-as-Co-Founder-Aneel-Bhusri-Returns-to-Lead-the-Companys-Next-Chapter\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday&#x27;s Public Advocacy for Human-Centered, Ethically Governed AI (2026-02-12)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday continues to champion responsible AI governance, releasing updated masterclass resources outlining robust frameworks for trustworthy agentic AI deployment in HR and finance. The guidance details transparency, bias mitigation, and ongoing auditing, resonating strongly with EU, UK, and US regulatory currents. As HR leaders adopt agentic AI to automate workflows and enhance decision-making, Workday positions its approach as both differentiated and risk-mitigated.\\n\\nFor Workday customers and Deloitte practitioners, these resources are increasingly pivotal as organizations face regulatory scrutiny and societal expectations about AI use, especially in personnel decisioning and employee experience. The clear articulation of ethical AI practices enables Deloitte’s Workday consultants to proactively address client concerns about compliance, fairness, and long-term trust—a competitive advantage in high-risk, high-visibility digital transformation projects.\\n\\nSo what for Deloitte: Embedding and operationalizing Workday’s responsible agentic AI frameworks within transformation programs strengthens Deloitte’s position as a trusted advisor and risk mitigator, directly addressing boardroom-level apprehensions about AI-driven automation in HR and finance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Revolutionizes Workday’s Customer Storytelling and Value Proposition (2026-02-13)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s latest perspectives piece highlights real-world impacts of agentic AI—showing how augmenting human heroes with enterprise agents yields measurable ROI in recruitment, retention, and HR service delivery. Detailed case studies from Capita and Skyscanner illustrate the successful implementation of AI-powered Workday Dashboards and Prism Analytics, tying advanced automation directly to business outcomes.\\n\\nWorkday’s approach aligns with analyst coverage from Deloitte Insights, emphasizing that the source of AI differentiation now comes from domain-specific models, unified data intelligence, and contextualized automation—areas where the Workday ecosystem remains strong. For Deloitte’s practice, these public case stories offer concrete proof points and narratives to support client buy-in, particularly where pilots have moved from experimentation to scaled adoption.\\n\\nSo what for Deloitte: Leveraging these case studies supports business case development and outcome-based selling, giving Deloitte consultants tangible ROI benchmarks as they shepherd clients through agentic AI deployments in HR and finance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/making-people-heroes-ai-era.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny and Guidance on AI Fairness and Bias Across HR (2026-02-13)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Throughout February, the US EEOC and European regulators intensified scrutiny on bias, transparency, and fairness in employment-related AI—spanning screening, hiring, promotions, and performance management. Recent enforcement actions and settlements, including requirements for AI-deployed bias detection, underscore regulators’ determination to hold HR tech providers (Workday included) and their consultancy partners accountable for both outcomes and processes.\\n\\nThis landscape mandates robust, explainable agentic AI—especially as GSIs and SaaS vendors accelerate workflow automation and advanced analytics in the employee lifecycle. Workday’s proactive stance on ethical AI is thus differentiating but also raises the bar for partners to evidence compliance by design, not just in response to audits or incidents.\\n\\nSo what for Deloitte: Maintaining AI client services excellence now goes hand-in-hand with deep regulatory knowledge, implementation of auditable workflows, and constant vigilance over shifting legal interpretations—making regulatory enablement and transparency key skills for Deloitte’s HR transformation teams.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-challenges-hitting-HR-EEOC/644485\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Joule Accelerates Custom Agent Ecosystem and Integration Use Cases (2026-02-10)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP has significantly updated its Joule agent framework, enabling complex agent-to-agent collaboration, BYO model integration (notably with Nvidia), and rapid prototyping of workflow automations across HCM and ERP. Detailed community and developer resources provide step-by-step guidance on building, securing, and governing custom Joule agents for both SAP and third-party SaaS systems, intensifying the competitive benchmark against Workday, Oracle, and ServiceNow in the agentic AI arena.\\n\\nDeloitte’s SAP and multi-cloud ERP teams should view these advances as both a threat and an opportunity: the pace and openness of SAP’s developer ecosystem may attract clients seeking highly tailored automations, especially in complex, multi-vendor IT environments. Staying ahead means cross-training Workday and SAP teams in agent standardization, governance, and cross-system orchestration.\\n\\nSo what for Deloitte: The new breadth of agentic options in SAP Joule necessitates deeper ecosystem integration skills, giving Deloitte an opening to deliver uniquely orchestrated, cross-brand SaaS agent deployments—provided teams can bridge Workday, SAP, and hybrid architectures.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/pov-2-agent-to-agent-collaboration-with-sap-and-non-sap-agents-part-2-4/ba-p/14328363\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle announced that Etisalat &amp; (e&amp;) is driving global workforce AI transformation using Oracle’s agentic HR modules, coordinated with new releases in generative AI guardrails and explainability features.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s continued expansion of agentic AI for HR and talent processes, now buttressed by enterprise-grade compliance and bias safeguards, encroaches on Workday’s value proposition as the trusted, explainable HR platform. Deloitte’s Oracle practice must capitalize on these guardrails to mitigate risk anxieties with multinational clients, while Deloitte’s Workday team should double down on articulating value in unified governance, data cloud integration, and ethical automation.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s Joule framework and associated community-driven agent development paradigms were substantially upgraded, with focus on cross-SaaS collaboration and quick custom agent builds that can interact with external (non-SAP) applications.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP is mainstreaming agentic AI extensibility, making Joule not only a direct competitor to Workday’s Prism Analytics Data Hub and agentic platform capabilities but also creating a broader marketplace for Deloitte to design integration-first, client-specific solutions across ERP brands. Deloitte must build deeper technical integration capacity, supporting businesses seeking best-of-breed agentic automation.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow acquired Pyramid Analytics to strengthen its self-service analytics and agentic workflow automation within ITOM and HR service delivery.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow’s move blurs the traditional HR/IT boundaries, creating new agentic AI opportunities—and competitive threats—for SaaS vendors and advisory partners. Deloitte can leverage ServiceNow’s new analytic-agent offerings in digital workplace and HR engagements, but must differentiate using Workday’s purpose-built HR lineage and responsible AI positioning.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Dayforce\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Dayforce announced new AI governance frameworks and the deployment of production AI agents in HR, focusing on accelerated innovation and transparent, explainable automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Dayforce’s focus overlaps directly with Workday and Oracle, signaling increasing commoditization at the agentic platform level. Deloitte’s Workday practitioners must maintain a clear point of view on the superior scalability, auditability, and trusted analytics differentiators available within Workday deployments.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI Governance for HR/Finance Agents\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte Workday consultants can embed, audit, and communicate responsible AI practices in client implementations, preempting compliance risks and strengthening client trust.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Integration Design (SAP and Workday)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/pov-2-agent-to-agent-collaboration-with-sap-and-non-sap-agents-part-2-4/ba-p/14328363\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Teams can design and orchestrate cross-system agentic automations, enabling customers to realize value from multi-vendor SaaS and agent collaboration scenarios.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Regulatory Risk Assessment for AI in HR\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-challenges-hitting-HR-EEOC/644485\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte’s practitioners can proactively guide clients through the evolving patchwork of AI oversight, translating regulatory developments into actionable controls for compliant agentic automation.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Brief Deloitte Workday delivery and sales teams on Workday’s renewed AI leadership vision under Aneel Bhusri, including how to position trust and innovation messaging in proposals.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Integrate Workday’s updated responsible AI governance frameworks directly into ongoing HR and finance transformation projects, with emphasis on regulatory documentation.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Conduct skill-building sessions for SAP and Workday practitioners around custom agent development, focusing on cross-ecosystem collaboration and governance.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Monitor and catalogue regulatory changes or enforcement actions related to agentic AI in HR, updating internal playbooks for implementation risk management.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Draft use-case-specific client playbooks leveraging new case studies and Prism Analytics/agentic ROI metrics from Workday and competitive sources.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Client hesitation or delay in adopting Workday agentic AI due to perceived instability from executive turnover.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Proactively message continuity and renewed strategic clarity under Aneel Bhusri, leveraging analyst and customer testimonials.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Exposure to evolving regulatory and reputational risks in AI-enabled HR processes.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Embed responsible agent governance as a standard project deliverable, offer clients end-to-end compliance documentation, and maintain a regulatory watchlist.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Losing competitive ground to SAP’s rapidly evolving and more open agent ecosystem.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Cross-train teams in both Workday and SAP agent technologies, and cultivate partnerships for hybrid agent deployments.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Confusion among enterprise clients regarding the comparative merits of agentic AI platforms (Workday vs. Oracle/SAP/ServiceNow/Dayforce).\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Develop and distribute Deloitte-branded competitive analysis and use-case playbooks that sharply articulate Workday’s differentiated advantages.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;sources\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Announces CEO Transition as Co-Founder Aneel Bhusri Returns to Lead the Company&#x27;s Next Chapter\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-09-Workday-Announces-CEO-Transition-as-Co-Founder-Aneel-Bhusri-Returns-to-Lead-the-Companys-Next-Chapter\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI Governance | Workday AI Masterclass\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Making People the Heroes of the AI Era - Workday Blog\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/making-people-heroes-ai-era.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Revolution Is Here: What&#x27;s Next?

Workday’s executive transition to Aneel Bhusri as CEO stabilized its strategic direction, with immediate implications for major transformation clients and the broader agentic AI narrative. Regulatory currents intensified, with the US EEOC and European regulators issuing new guidance and enforcement signals on AI fairness, transparency, and auditability—applying heightened pressure to both technology providers and their SI partners.\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Competitively, Oracle doubled down on agentic guardrails and models, while SAP Joule expanded its agent developer ecosystem to prioritize cross-SaaS integration and client-custom automation. At the same time, Workday released customer stories validating agentic ROI, and ServiceNow/Dayforce intensified their own agentic platform and governance messaging.
