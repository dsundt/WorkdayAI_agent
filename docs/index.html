<ul>
  <li><strong>Procure AI Raises $13M to Automate Business Procurement Tasks (2025-11-27):</strong> <br/>
    Procure AI, focused on agentic automation of procurement processes, has raised $13 million in new funding. Their AI-driven solution automates purchasing, policy compliance, and contract interpretation—reflecting increasing momentum for agentic SaaS in back office domains. As enterprise platforms like Workday expand AI marketplaces, such disruptors signal a growing need for open integration and responsible governance. This trend creates both opportunities and commercial pressure for Workday to expand its Extend ecosystem and for Deloitte’s Workday teams to advise clients on orchestration and risk. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/27/procure-ai-lands-13m-funding-automate-business-procurement-tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Leaders Overestimate Employee Excitement About AI (2025-11-26):</strong> <br/>
    Harvard Business Review uncovers a critical gap: while leadership teams often overestimate positive employee sentiment toward AI, actual workforce enthusiasm is more hesitant—especially without robust frameworks and transparency. This is especially relevant for agentic AI and Workday deployments, where end-to-end automation can provoke organizational trust issues if not accompanied by strong change management and responsible AI communication. Deloitte’s Workday practice should prioritize empathy-led change programs and clear governance messaging to drive sustainable adoption. <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/11/leaders-assume-employees-are-excited-about-ai-theyre-wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KPMG:</strong> KPMG’s latest research reveals that agentic AI deployments have tripled in a year, outpacing many organizations' risk and governance maturity. Their message to clients: partner with vendors and GSIs who combine innovation with responsible AI controls. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, highlighting Workday’s responsible AI and certification strengths is key for competitive differentiation. <a href="https://kpmg.com/xx/en/what-we-do/services/ai/agentic-ai-advantage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agentic AI Advantage by KPMG</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI Frameworks for Agentic SaaS:</strong> Learn to articulate Workday's responsible AI approach to clients, crucial for agent deployments in HR and Finance. <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> | 90-day outcome: Trusted, compliant client launches.</li>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI Ecosystem Integration Patterns:</strong> Design Workday-focused architectures to connect third-party agentic solutions, leveraging the expanding Workday AI partner network. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> | 90-day outcome: Faster, more flexible deployments and demos.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update client engagement decks with insights on automation funding and the agentic SaaS landscape.</li>
  <li>Refine change management and enablement programs to emphasize trust-building around agentic AI projects.</li>
  <li>Track further GSI/consultancy guidance on agentic AI governance for client advisory readiness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Scaling agentic AI before robust responsible AI frameworks are in place. <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Make responsible AI enablement mandatory in all agentic Workday project plans—using Workday's governance documentation and certifications as client-facing tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Overhyping the benefits of agentic AI, causing user resistance and slow adoption.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Focus practice communications on transparency, measurable outcomes, and user-centric stories.</li>
</ul>

Instead, recent funding in AI automation, continued analysis on agentic AI&#x27;s workforce impact, and accelerating deployment themes from the consulting sector warrant close monitoring for competitive signals and client conversations.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Procure AI Raises $13M to Automate Business Procurement Tasks (2025-11-27)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Procure AI, a startup focused on automating procurement processes with advanced AI, has secured $13 million in funding. This comes at a pivotal time when enterprise SaaS decision-makers—especially those using platforms like Workday—are seeking digitized, streamlined, and ultimately more autonomous back office functions. Procure AI&#x27;s solution, which can ingest contracts and unstructured data to proactively recommend purchase strategies and enforce policy compliance, reflects a trend toward agentic automation across operational workflows. \\n\\nStrategically, this movement puts pressure on established vendors (Workday, SAP, Oracle) to open their API ecosystems and AI marketplaces for best-of-breed automation startups. Several GSIs cite that procurement, AP, and supplier onboarding are top areas for agentic AI pilots due to immediate measurable ROI and multi-vendor integration potential. As new entrants leverage rapid funding to advance agentic capabilities, the bar is raised for Workday’s Extend platform and AI partnership programs to offer easy integration, orchestration, and governance for this growing category.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the so-what is twofold: (1) Advise clients on the evolving agentic SaaS landscape, especially around vendor interoperability and risk (including data access and AI bias) when deploying point AI solutions into HR and finance stacks; and (2) Bring advisory POV on Workday-specific procurement automation opportunities, leveraging both Workday-native AI and ecosystem partnerships that comply with evolving responsible AI standards.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/27/procure-ai-lands-13m-funding-automate-business-procurement-tasks\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Leaders Overestimate Employee Excitement About AI (2025-11-26)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A newly published Harvard Business Review analysis spotlights a critical disconnect in how organizations interpret workforce sentiment toward AI adoption. While C-level leaders often assume enthusiasm for AI transformation—including agentic roles and digital coworkers—the data indicates significant gaps in understanding, with employees more cautious and seeking clear frameworks, assurances, and training. \\n\\nIn the context of Workday deployments, this misalignment is more pronounced due to the highly visible nature of platform automation (e.g., skills inference, scheduling agents, finance bots). Multiple GSIs warn that rapid deployment of agentic AI without commensurate change management and ethical guardrails increases project risk and may depress adoption ROI. HBR’s piece elevates the need for robust communication, incremental onboarding, and the integration of responsible AI frameworks—especially as Workday and partners roll out AI agents at scale.\\n\\nThe key implication for Deloitte’s Workday practice is to lead client conversations with empathy and trust-building, not automation hype. Change adoption programs, training, and transparent AI governance documentation should be treated as critical delivery workstreams on par with technical rollout.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://hbr.org/2025/11/leaders-assume-employees-are-excited-about-ai-theyre-wrong\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG research underscores that agentic AI deployment in enterprises has tripled over the past 12 months, even as risk and governance frameworks lag behind.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG’s insights highlight that CxOs are under mounting pressure to scale experimentation in agentic AI workflows—ranging from digital HR agents to AI-powered finance orchestration—even while comprehensive controls and ethical frameworks are still nascent. The research indicates that market momentum now favors GSIs and SaaS vendors equipped not only with agentic AI accelerators but also with robust responsible AI toolkits. For Workday, this reinforces the commercial value of its Responsible AI Governance programs and certification achievements, which should be accentuated in Deloitte client delivery and pre-sales engagement.

This is especially relevant for agentic AI and Workday deployments, where end-to-end automation can provoke organizational trust issues if not accompanied by strong change management and responsible AI communication. Deloitte’s Workday practice should prioritize empathy-led change programs and clear governance messaging to drive sustainable adoption. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://hbr.org/2025/11/leaders-assume-employees-are-excited-about-ai-theyre-wrong\\\&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KPMG:&lt;/strong&gt; KPMG’s latest research reveals that agentic AI deployments have tripled in a year, outpacing many organizations&#x27; risk and governance maturity.
