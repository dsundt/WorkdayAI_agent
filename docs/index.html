<ul>
  <li><b>Workday Launches Paradox Conversational ATS to Accelerate Frontline Hiring (Published 2026-01-08)</b><br/><p>Workday announced the general availability of the Paradox Conversational Applicant Tracking System (ATS) within its HCM platform, aiming to streamline frontline recruitment using AI-driven chat workflows. This is a breakthrough for organizations in high-churn sectors like retail and hospitality, reducing time-to-hire and automating candidate engagement. Strategically, it positions Workday as a leader in transforming operational HR processes, not just administrative tasks. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these integrated capabilities mean faster deployments, richer advisory touchpoints, and new change management opportunities. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Paradox-Conversational-Applicant-Tracking-System-ATS-Now-Available-Through-Workday,-Helping-Organizations-Hire-Frontline-Workers-Faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p></li>
  <li><b>Workday Underscores Retail and Hospitality Sector Momentum with New Customer Wins and AI Capabilities (Published 2026-01-08)</b><br/><p>Workday’s latest update spotlights a significant increase in retail and hospitality clients leveraging its HCM platform, citing AI-powered solutions and new practices like efficient scheduling and skills-based hiring as key draws. This demonstrates Workday’s ability to deliver sector-specialized value and real operational impact, strengthening its competitive positioning against both legacy and cloud-native HCM rivals. For implementation partners, the news supplies powerful evidence for client case-building and reveals sector priorities for new solution configurations. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Workday-Accelerates-Retail-and-Hospitality-Momentum-with-New-Customer-Wins-and-AI-Innovations-for-the-Frontline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the announcement</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SAP: Expanded AI Options for Retail HCM</b><br/><p>SAP has announced fresh AI features in its SuccessFactors suite tailored to the retail sector, centering on autonomous skills discovery, talent mobility, and compliance automation. This strategic expansion is a direct challenge to Workday’s sector push and raises the bar for competitor differentiation in operational HR use cases. For Deloitte, it sharpens the need for nuanced, sector-aware advisory work, and for direct client comparisons of feature realities in large program selections. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/08/sap-expands-ai-options-retailers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View source</a></p></li>
  <li><b>Microsoft: Agentic AI and Retail Process Automation Launched</b><br/><p>Microsoft rolled out new agentic AI capabilities within its Dynamics 365 platform focused on retail, offering agent-orchestrated process flows and extensible business logic across applications. By pushing AI agents deeper into business operations and linking with Copilot, Microsoft is creating a compelling ecosystem rival to Workday in scenarios where clients value broad business platform coverage and modular extensibility. Deloitte must be able to articulate these differences and guide complex coexistence or migration pathways. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2026/01/08/agentic-ai-in-retail-how-dynamics-365-powers-commerce-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read blog</a></p></li>

Across the competitive landscape, both SaaS HCM rivals and service providers are moving rapidly to integrate agentic AI and conversational recruiting into their offerings.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Launches Paradox Conversational ATS to Accelerate Frontline Hiring (Published 2026-01-08)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On January 8, 2026, Workday announced the general availability of the Paradox Conversational Applicant Tracking System (ATS) within its platform, directly targeting the persistent workforce challenges in retail and hospitality. This ATS leverages AI-driven chat to automate everything from application capture to interview scheduling, aiming to dramatically reduce time-to-hire and hiring friction for frontline roles. \\n\\nStrategically, this development signals Workday’s shift from traditional, back-office HR core functionality toward high-volume, operational use cases where real-time hiring velocity and digital candidate experience are vital differentiators. By delivering a seamlessly integrated, AI-powered workflow, Workday seeks to position itself as the provider of choice for organizations contending with elevated employee churn and ongoing skills shortages, issues acutely felt in retail and hospitality.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice and its clients, the move implies both a richer set of accelerators for talent acquisition transformation projects and heightened client expectations regarding time-to-value and digital experience. It opens new advisory opportunities around frontline hiring redesign, change programs, and integration with distributed workforce management. The ready availability of Paradox through Workday eliminates custom integration overhead, accelerating client ROI and increasing Workday’s stickiness in verticals most susceptible to labor volatility.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Paradox-Conversational-Applicant-Tracking-System-ATS-Now-Available-Through-Workday,-Helping-Organizations-Hire-Frontline-Workers-Faster\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Underscores Retail and Hospitality Sector Momentum with New Customer Wins and AI Capabilities (Published 2026-01-08)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s latest sector update, released on January 8, 2026, emphasizes a surge in new customers from the retail and hospitality segments—highlighting brands gravitating to Workday HCM for its new-fit AI innovations. This announcement reinforces the strategic narrative that Workday’s AI investments are producing tangible, market-facing wins, not just feature additions. \\n\\nFrom a competitive perspective, Workday is leveraging its investment in solutions like Paradox ATS and other frontline-focused tools as market differentiators, contrasting its approach with legacy competitors that often lag in retail sector verticalization. The update also leads by showcasing real-world client outcomes, such as reduced scheduling conflicts, improved skills-matching, and optimized staffing, reinforcing that AI adoption is moving from aspiration to operational reality.\\n\\nFor Deloitte and its Workday-focused consultants, this presents rich case material for client conversation, supports the business case toward AI/HCM convergence projects, and provides sector benchmarks for go-to-market positioning. It may also unlock co-innovation opportunities with clients eager to join Workday’s retail and hospitality customer cohort and tap new agent-led workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Workday-Accelerates-Retail-and-Hospitality-Momentum-with-New-Customer-Wins-and-AI-Innovations-for-the-Frontline\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP announced expanded AI options within its SuccessFactors HCM suite targeting retail customers on January 8, 2026, focusing on skill discovery, talent mobility, and compliance automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;By aggressively verticalizing its HCM platform for retail and emphasizing autonomous, AI-driven processes, SAP is seeking to counter Workday’s momentum in the sector. This heightens the competitive environment, particularly in large program bids where sector-specialized functionality is vital. Deloitte teams must be conversant in SAP’s claimed differentiators—such as integration depth and compliance tooling—while highlighting Workday’s new abilities in fast, AI-powered frontline talent management and customer establishment in key sectors.

This is a breakthrough for organizations in high-churn sectors like retail and hospitality, reducing time-to-hire and automating candidate engagement. Strategically, it positions Workday as a leader in transforming operational HR processes, not just administrative tasks. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these integrated capabilities mean faster deployments, richer advisory touchpoints, and new change management opportunities. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Paradox-Conversational-Applicant-Tracking-System-ATS-Now-Available-Through-Workday,-Helping-Organizations-Hire-Frontline-Workers-Faster\\\&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workday Underscores Retail and Hospitality Sector Momentum with New Customer Wins and AI Capabilities (Published 2026-01-08)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workday’s latest update spotlights a significant increase in retail and hospitality clients leveraging its HCM platform, citing AI-powered solutions and new practices like efficient scheduling and skills-based hiring as key draws. This demonstrates Workday’s ability to deliver sector-specialized value and real operational impact, strengthening its competitive positioning against both legacy and cloud-native HCM rivals. For implementation partners, the news supplies powerful evidence for client case-building and reveals sector priorities for new solution configurations. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-08-Workday-Accelerates-Retail-and-Hospitality-Momentum-with-New-Customer-Wins-and-AI-Innovations-for-the-Frontline\\\&quot;&gt;Read the announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAP: Expanded AI Options for Retail HCM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP has announced fresh AI features in its SuccessFactors suite tailored to the retail sector, centering on autonomous skills discovery, talent mobility, and compliance automation. This strategic expansion is a direct challenge to Workday’s sector push and raises the bar for competitor differentiation in operational HR use cases. For Deloitte, it sharpens the need for nuanced, sector-aware advisory work, and for direct client comparisons of feature realities in large program selections. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/08/sap-expands-ai-options-retailers\\\&quot;&gt;View source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft: Agentic AI and Retail Process Automation Launched&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rolled out new agentic AI capabilities within its Dynamics 365 platform focused on retail, offering agent-orchestrated process flows and extensible business logic across applications. By pushing AI agents deeper into business operations and linking with Copilot, Microsoft is creating a compelling ecosystem rival to Workday in scenarios where clients value broad business platform coverage and modular extensibility.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Thank you sincerely for your expert knowledge and convincing explanation And your patience.🌹🌹👍👍\n\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\n\nShare:\n\nBluesky   LinkedIn   WhatsApp   Email   Share   Link\n\n English Only\n English Only\n\nTop Bottom [...] The first clause has a finite verb (organized), conjugated in the past tense. The second clause has a non-finite verb (the participle seeking), which is not inflected for tense. A finite verb must have a verb, but non-finite verbs often appear without an explicit subject, as is the case here. Since the non-finite/participial clause is incomplete, we can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s exact nature. It&#x27;s ambiguous. Put the missing stuff back, and we can see things more clearly. Of course we can&#x27;t do that. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s omitted; we can only make assumptions. One assumption is that the non-finite clause is what&#x27;s left of a relative clause that&#x27;s been reduced, in which case it&#x27;s an adjective clause:  \n   \n a national strike which was seeking an eight-hour workday [...] Yes, you can, but you still have the same issue: an incomplete non-finite clause, with an infinitive rather than a participle:  \n   \n [US activists organized a national strike] [to seek an eight hour workday]  \n   \n As above, whether \&quot;to see an eight hour workday\&quot; functions adjectivally or adverbially depends on what you see as the missing stuff in the non-finite infinitive clause. Either way, the non-finite infinitive clause is a modifier in sentence structure.   \n   \n The point of reduced clauses (participle or infinitive) is to present information more concisely. Shorter clauses are easier to process.   \n   \n Now, as you&#x27;ve see in this thread, some don&#x27;t see any problem using \&quot;to seek...\&quot; but others reject it.\n\n#### 如沐春风\n\n##### Senior Member\n\nChinese\n\n #15&quot;,

This is the usual expression if you mean those five days. We&#x27;d talk about working days only if there was a possibility of them being different - so &#x27;working days&#x27; excludes public holidays. A bank might guarantee to clear a cheque (put the money in your account) within three working days. So if you put it in on the Thursday the day before Easter, you might not get the money for almost a week, because the Easter holidays aren&#x27;t counted in &#x27;working days&#x27;.\n\nA\n\n#### annjuks\n\n##### Member\n\nLatvia\n\nLatvian\n\n #3\n\nThank you very much, your explanation was very helpful\n\nYou must log in or register to reply here.\n\nShare:\n\nBluesky   LinkedIn   WhatsApp   Email   Share   Link [...] A\n\n#### annjuks\n\n##### Member\n\nLatvia\n\nLatvian\n\n #1\n\nHello,  \n What&#x27;s the difference between \&quot;working days\&quot; and \&quot;weekdays\&quot;?

In 2012, SAP rolled that functionality into the SAP SuccessFactors Suite XM, a cloud-based software series that cover every aspect of HCM, from core HR functions to workforce analytics and employee engagement metrics.

The software was built to integrate seamlessly with SAP’s finance and payroll solutions to reduce errors.\n\n### Spend management with SAP [...] ### Financial management with SAP\n\nSAP integrates financial management with other functions of a business, which allowed finance teams to collaborate more effectively with other departments. Its development of real-time payments solutions and advanced reporting capabilities helped businesses make informed decisions and comply with regulatory requirements.

Using machine learning and AI, SAP’s latest generation of tools can automate routine financial processes and detect anomalies as well as provide more accurate forecasting.\n\n### Human capital management with SAP [...] ### Customer experience and CRM\n\nSAP’s customer experience modules allow companies to unify their sales, marketing and service data to improve customer relationships. For example, an e-commerce company might use SAP to deliver a unique engagement model based on existing customer data or improve the user experience of its business based on customer feedback.\n\n### Talent management and HCM\n\nTools such as SAP SuccessFactors are used to plan and manage workforce tasks and discover new talent. Companies deploy the software to better understand what motivates employees and how to improve their efficiency.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;As organisations evolve beyond static planning, agentic AI-driven workflows will automate tasks and data will flow continuously across networks, enabling teams to anticipate disruptions, simulate trade-offs and rebalance production in real time.\n\n\&quot;Resilience will continue to shift from being reactive to a continuously optimised state of operations, becoming a structural capability embedded in the enterprise architecture itself.\&quot;\n\n## Beyond automation: AI as a governance engine\n\nSudhir Bhojwani, Co-Founder and CEO of ORO Labs: \&quot;Most of the industry&#x27;s discussion about agentic AI focuses on productivity: the number of tasks that can be automated and how much faster we can move.

[...] Continuous Updates: The system is regularly updated with new features and fixes, which helps in maintaining its functionality. \&quot;One thing I&#x27;ll add about Dayforce as a whole, is that they are making updates all the time and they push out fixes for any glitches that come up pretty much every week.\&quot;\n\n### Mixed Experiences\n\nImplementation Challenges: Some users have noted that the implementation of Dayforce can be challenging if not handled correctly. \&quot;Shitty implementation leads to shitty results.\&quot; [...] ### Positive Experiences\n\nIntegration and Customization: Many users appreciate the all-in-one nature of Dayforce, which reduces the need for integrations with other systems. It pairs well with tools like Indeed and offers extensive customization options for job boards and offer letter processes. \&quot;My org uses Dayforce as our all-in-one HRIS. We like that we don&#x27;t need an integration between an ATS and Dayforce.\&quot;\n\nUser-Friendly Interface: Dayforce is often praised for its user-friendly interface, especially for hiring managers. \&quot;It is also pretty user friendly for hiring managers, which was important for us.\&quot;&quot;,

Refer to Managing File Imports. |\n| 2 - Add organization-level attributes for partner applications | Add the organization-level attributes for the applications the organization wants to offer. Although automatic provisioning adds the organization information, the process does not know which applications the organization wants to offer, so you must add these attributes at the organization level to continue. | [...] | 6 - Assign users to roles | Assign users to roles based on the partner applications the user should access. You can assign users to roles using the Users page. |\n| 7 - Add data profiles | Create a data profile and add data items, FEINs or PSIDs, to the data profile. You can add multiple data items to a data profile, and you can use the same data items across multiple profiles. |&quot;,

Regional wastewater initiatives for Hampton Roads municipal utilities and the Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD) are coordinated through the HRPDC Directors of Utilities Committee. Hampton Roads is served by separate sanitary sewer systems which means runoff from rainfall does not flow to the wastewater collection system. Localities have separate stormwater collection systems that convey flow to streams, rivers, and the Chesapeake Bay. [...] In cooperation with the Hampton Roads localities, HRSD developed an integrated plan to reduce sanitary sewer system overflows.  The plan addresses regulatory and environmental obligations and protects public health and the region&#x27;s water resources.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;Our partnership with Workday is a breakthrough in delivering the trust organizations need to adopt AI,\&quot; said Charles Lamanna, president, business and industry Copilot, Microsoft. \&quot;By seamlessly registering agents built with Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry into Workday&#x27;s Agent System of Record, we&#x27;re giving customers full visibility into their AI ecosystem. This integration equips leaders with actionable analytics to measure ROI, enforce governance, and ensure their AI agents are secure and delivering real value.\&quot;\n\nEmpowering the Intelligent Enterprise\n\nThis latest innovation between Workday and Microsoft will create a seamless and secure experience for building and managing AI agents across the enterprise, allowing customers to: [...] Enhance Human-Agent Collaboration: The new integration between Workday and Microsoft&#x27;s agent systems will allow seamless interoperability between different AI agents. For example, an employee could ask a Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot to update career goals or submit a peer review. The request would be handed off to the Workday agent inline, allowing the employee to complete the workflow in Workday agent without leaving Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent. This will help deliver a unified, secure, and context-preserving experience in the flow of work. [...] SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday Rising 2025 -- Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents, today announced a new collaboration with Microsoft to help organizations securely manage their people and AI agents across their platforms. Customers that build AI agents using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio will be able to easily register and manage them within the Workday Agent System of Record (ASOR). This integration between Workday ASOR and Microsoft Entra Agent ID will help ensure every agent built on Microsoft agent building platforms has a verified identity and the right business context to operate safely and effectively across the business.&quot;,

From there, you can choose an approach, which might include in-person group sessions, virtual Microsoft Whiteboard sessions, one-on-one interviews, Microsoft 365 Loop collaboration, or whatever modality works best, then communicate the process to participants. Whatever you choose, the final step in this phase is conducting your employee engagements to document existing and aspirational Copilot usage scenarios.  \n   \nPhase 3: Deliver&quot;,

[...] Another assumption is that the non-finite clause is what&#x27;s left of a prepositional phrase, in which case it&#x27;s an adverbial clause:  \n   \n a national strike because they were seeking an eight-hour workday  \n   \n Either way, adjective clause or adverbial clause, the reduced non-finite/participial clause \&quot;seeking an eight hour workday\&quot; is a modifier; that&#x27;s its grammatical function in the sentence. It&#x27;s just that we can&#x27; tell if its an adjectival modifier or an adverbial modifier. Not that it matters. The overall message is the same, one way or the other.   \n&gt; 如沐春风 said:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Can \&quot;seeking\&quot; be replaced with \&quot;to seek\&quot;？  \n&gt;    \n&gt;  I would appreciate it if you could give me an explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Click to expand... [...] The first clause has a finite verb (organized), conjugated in the past tense. The second clause has a non-finite verb (the participle seeking), which is not inflected for tense. A finite verb must have a verb, but non-finite verbs often appear without an explicit subject, as is the case here. Since the non-finite/participial clause is incomplete, we can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s exact nature. It&#x27;s ambiguous. Put the missing stuff back, and we can see things more clearly. Of course we can&#x27;t do that. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s omitted; we can only make assumptions. One assumption is that the non-finite clause is what&#x27;s left of a relative clause that&#x27;s been reduced, in which case it&#x27;s an adjective clause:  \n   \n a national strike which was seeking an eight-hour workday&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;With agents, you can automate tasks for your customers and answer questions for them. For example, you can create an agent that helps customers process insurance claims or an agent that helps customers make travel reservations. You don&#x27;t have to provision capacity, manage infrastructure, or write custom code. Amazon Bedrock manages prompt engineering, memory, monitoring, encryption, user permissions, and API invocation.\n\nAgents perform the following tasks: [...] Automate tasks in your application using AI agents - Amazon Bedrock\n\nDocumentationAmazon BedrockUser Guide\n\n# Automate tasks in your application using AI agents\n\nAmazon Bedrock Agents offers you the ability to build and configure autonomous agents in your application. An agent helps your end-users complete actions based on organization data and user input. Agents orchestrate interactions between foundation models (FMs), data sources, software applications, and user conversations. In addition, agents automatically call APIs to take actions and invoke knowledge bases to supplement information for these actions. By integrating agents, you can accelerate your development effort to deliver generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) applications. [...] Agents perform the following tasks:\n\n Extend foundation models to understand user requests and break down the tasks that the agent must perform into smaller steps.\n Collect additional information from a user through natural conversation.\n Take actions to fulfill a customer&#x27;s request by making API calls to your company systems.\n Augment performance and accuracy by querying data sources.\n\nTo use an agent, you perform the following steps:\n\n1. (Optional) Create a knowledge base to store your private data in that database. For more information, see Retrieve data and generate AI responses with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n2. Configure an agent for your use case and add at least one of the following components:&quot;,

      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-how.html&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Build-time configuration\n\nAn agent consists of the following components:\n\n Foundation model – You choose a foundation model (FM) that the agent invokes to interpret user input and subsequent prompts in its orchestration process. The agent also invokes the FM to generate responses and follow-up steps in its process.\n Instructions – You write instructions that describe what the agent is designed to do. With advanced prompts, you can further customize instructions for the agent at every step of orchestration and include Lambda functions to parse each step&#x27;s output.\n At least one of the following:\n\n  + Action groups – You define the actions that the agent should perform for the user (through providing the following resources): [...] Input – The API operation and/or parameters identified during orchestration.\n       Output – The response from the API invocation or the response from the function invocation.\n  + Knowledge bases – Associate knowledge bases with an agent. The agent queries the knowledge base for extra context to augment response generation and input into steps of the orchestration process. [...] Query an associated knowledge base (Knowledge base response generation) to retrieve additional context and summarize the data to augment its generation.\n       Reprompt the user to gather all the required parameters for the action.\n   4. The agent generates an output, known as an observation, from invoking an action and/or summarizing results from a knowledge base. The agent uses the observation to augment the base prompt, which is then interpreted with a foundation model. The agent then determines if it needs to reiterate the orchestration process.\n   5. This loop continues until the agent returns a response to the user or until it needs to prompt the user for extra information.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;During the existence of the partnership, fiscal transparency continues to apply, and the underlying assets that are realised are taken into account. Calculating the taxable base will, given the different acquisition values, cause the necessary complexity and administrative burden.  \n In addition, the withdrawal (by one or more partners) from or the dissolution of the partnership can also constitute a taxable event, at least according to a strict interpretation. This can, in certain situations, lead to a redistribution of ownership proportions and thus potentially to a realisation.\n\n##### Long term incentives &amp; management incentive plans\n\nStock options [...] Did you find this useful?\n\nYes;)\n\nNo;)\n\n#### Thanks for your feedback\n\n#### Your feedback is important to us\n\nTo tell us what you think, please update your settings to accept analytics and performance cookies.\n\nUpdate analytics and performance\n\nNeed help updating cookies?\n\n### Tax Reforms Hub: The latest federal and regional tax measures in Belgium [...] For assets acquired before 1 January 2026, the loss is calculated as the negative difference between the price received and the value on 31 December 2025.\n\nIn principle, no account is taken of historical losses.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business. [...] At Salesforce, we give startups a growth path that fits their pace. Starter Suite gets you started with an all-in-one CRM, Pro Suite adds flexibility, and Foundations unlocks AI and Agentforce 360 when you’re ready.\n\nAgentforce 360 then works alongside your CRM data, not against it. How? Data Cloud pulls in data from every touchpoint and system, giving Agentforce 360 the context it needs to act on it instantly. It simplifies the process of managing customer information while amplifying the value you get from it. If you’re building deeper customer relationships or optimizing internal workflows, Agentforce 360 makes sure that your data is actively working for you.\n\nHere’s how Salesforce helps startups:\n\n## AI Synopsis\n\n## 2. Automate tedious tasks; no more boring stuff\n\n## AI Synopsis [...] ## AI Synopsis\n\n## 3. Fully scale without a full budget\n\nAs your customer base grows, your team shouldn’t have to burn out to keep up. Agentforce 360 acts as a digital extension of your workforce, allowing your startup to maintain a “small team feel” even as you reach enterprise-level volume. Here’s how it helps you scale smartly and affordably:\n\nDrastically reduce overhead: Startups often struggle with “software sprawl.” By using Salesforce for small business, you get elite AI capabilities and automation directly within your CRM. This eliminates the need for multiple expensive third-party tools and keeps your tech stack lean.&quot;,

Visitors who are not native speakers would be much more likely to be confused by the word &#x27;workday&#x27; (which is probably not easily found in the average English phrase book) than by &#x27;Monday&#x27;, which is more easily found.  \n   \n And &#x27;workday&#x27; is meaningless when one is retired and on vacation and thus more likely to visit a museum on a Thursday morning, when all working folk are at work.\n\n#### JulianStuart\n\n##### Senior Member\n\nSonoma County CA\n\nEnglish (UK then US)\n\n #8&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;seeking vs. to seek - WordReference Forums&quot;,
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/seeking-vs-to-seek.4076594/&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;There are two verbs, and therefore two clauses. Let&#x27;s put the clauses in brackets (I&#x27;m not considering the phrase \&quot;In May 1886\&quot;):  \n   \n [US activists organized a national strike] [seeking an eight-hour workday] [...] The first clause has a finite verb (organized), conjugated in the past tense. The second clause has a non-finite verb (the participle seeking), which is not inflected for tense. A finite verb must have a verb, but non-finite verbs often appear without an explicit subject, as is the case here. Since the non-finite/participial clause is incomplete, we can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s exact nature. It&#x27;s ambiguous. Put the missing stuff back, and we can see things more clearly. Of course we can&#x27;t do that. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s omitted; we can only make assumptions. One assumption is that the non-finite clause is what&#x27;s left of a relative clause that&#x27;s been reduced, in which case it&#x27;s an adjective clause:  \n   \n a national strike which was seeking an eight-hour workday [...] Another assumption is that the non-finite clause is what&#x27;s left of a prepositional phrase, in which case it&#x27;s an adverbial clause:  \n   \n a national strike because they were seeking an eight-hour workday  \n   \n Either way, adjective clause or adverbial clause, the reduced non-finite/participial clause \&quot;seeking an eight hour workday\&quot; is a modifier; that&#x27;s its grammatical function in the sentence. It&#x27;s just that we can&#x27; tell if its an adjectival modifier or an adverbial modifier. Not that it matters. The overall message is the same, one way or the other.   \n&gt; 如沐春风 said:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Can \&quot;seeking\&quot; be replaced with \&quot;to seek\&quot;？  \n&gt;    \n&gt;  I would appreciate it if you could give me an explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Click to expand...&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;functions such as HR, sales, and product, and from support functions such as legal and compliance. Further, leaders can empathize with employees’ uneasiness about AI’s impacts on potential job losses by being honest about new skill requirements and head count changes. Forums where employees can provide input on AI applications, voice concerns, and share ideas are valuable for maintaining a transparent, human-first culture. [...] Achieving AI superagency in the workplace is not simply about mastering technology. It is every bit as much about supporting people, creating processes, and managing governance. The next chapters explore the nontechnological factors that will help shape the deployment of AI in the workplace.\n\nChapter 2 [...] _Federated governance models._ Managing data and models can give teams autonomy to develop new AI tools while centrally controlling risk. Leaders can directly oversee high-risk or high-visibility issues, such as setting policies and processes to monitor models and outputs for fairness, safety, and explainability. But they can set direction and delegate other monitoring to business units, including measuring performance-based criteria such as accuracy, speed, and scalability.\n   _Budget agility._ Given technological advances across models, as well as the opportunity to curate an optimal mix of LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and agents, business leaders should keep their budgets flexible. This helps enterprises optimize their AI deployments simultaneously for costs and performance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit depicts the share of US employees who highly trust different institutions to deploy gen AI tools responsibly, safely, and ethically. The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent). Source: McKinsey US employee survey, Oct–Nov 2024. This image description was completed with the assistance of [...] Chapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. [...] Image description ends.\n\n### Leaders can invest more in their employees\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in _Superagency_. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit).&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nLoading\n\n Gathering AI Synopsis…\n\nYou’ve seen the commercials. As Matthew McConaughey says, “Agentforce 360 is what AI was meant to be.” It lets you create and deploy AI agents — autonomous, proactive applications designed to execute specialized tasks like solving customer issues, optimizing sales opportunities, and boosting marketing campaigns with minimal human engagement. Think of it as your digital labor partner that works 24/7 to help you deliver exceptional results.\n\nAgentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action. [...] They don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business.\n\nAgentforce 360 is the comprehensive platform that unifies AI agents, human employees, and company data into a single, trusted ecosystem. The Agentforce 360 Platform is available to try for free and depends on your level of needs to get started.\n\nLet’s get to the six ways Agentforce 360 is helping startups all over the globe:\n\n## AI Synopsis\n\nLoading\n\n Gathering AI Synopsis…\n\n## 1.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit \n\nImage 9: Employee segments differ, but all indicate a high familiarity with gen AI.\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. [...] Image description begins:\n\nThe exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] Image description ends.\n\n### Leaders can invest more in their employees\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in _Superagency_. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nRepetitive tasks kill your productivity. Agentforce 360 flips that story by stepping in where the busywork lives. Following up with leads no longer slows you down because Agentforce 360 keeps the conversation moving. Customer appointments stay on track with reminders and updates sent automatically. Even the more strategic moves, like building a close plan or suggesting the right product, happen faster because the heavy lifting is already done.\n\nStudies show that employees spend 58% of their workday on repetitive and mundane administrative tasks. For SMBs and startups, this can result in missed opportunities to grow and connect with customers. Agentforce 360 offers many use cases that help you address this challenge. Here are a few ways it can help you save time: [...] ## AI Synopsis\n\n## What is Agentforce 360?\n\n## AI Synopsis\n\nYou’ve seen the commercials. As Matthew McConaughey says, “Agentforce 360 is what AI was meant to be.” It lets you create and deploy AI agents — autonomous, proactive applications designed to execute specialized tasks like solving customer issues, optimizing sales opportunities, and boosting marketing campaigns with minimal human engagement. Think of it as your digital labor partner that works 24/7 to help you deliver exceptional results. [...] Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.\n\nDue to rounding, percentages may not always sum to 100 percent. [...] employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don&#x27;t anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don&#x27;t anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.\n\nDue to rounding, percentages may not always sum to 100 percent. [...] employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don&#x27;t anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don&#x27;t anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nRepetitive tasks kill your productivity. Agentforce 360 flips that story by stepping in where the busywork lives. Following up with leads no longer slows you down because Agentforce 360 keeps the conversation moving. Customer appointments stay on track with reminders and updates sent automatically. Even the more strategic moves, like building a close plan or suggesting the right product, happen faster because the heavy lifting is already done.\n\nStudies show that employees spend 58% of their workday on repetitive and mundane administrative tasks. For SMBs and startups, this can result in missed opportunities to grow and connect with customers. Agentforce 360 offers many use cases that help you address this challenge. Here are a few ways it can help you save time: [...] Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business. [...] ## 5. AI agents keep customers happy with 24/7 support\n\nCustomers expect quick, reliable support at any time of day. Agentforce 360 makes it possible to offer round-the-clock service without adding more staff or long hours to your day. Your customers will never be left hanging, even at midnight or on weekends. Agentforce 360 can handle all sorts of customer interactions, ranging from basic questions to more complex issues. It also learns from your data and customizes responses based on what each customer needs. This way, every interaction feels personal, but without the need for a human to be there every single time.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 1\n\nAn innovation as powerful as the steam engine. This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide—and even make—decisions. That’s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another. [...] The exhibit depicts the share of US employees who highly trust different institutions to deploy gen AI tools responsibly, safely, and ethically. The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent).

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nRepetitive tasks kill your productivity. Agentforce 360 flips that story by stepping in where the busywork lives. Following up with leads no longer slows you down because Agentforce 360 keeps the conversation moving. Customer appointments stay on track with reminders and updates sent automatically. Even the more strategic moves, like building a close plan or suggesting the right product, happen faster because the heavy lifting is already done.\n\nStudies show that employees spend 58% of their workday on repetitive and mundane administrative tasks. For SMBs and startups, this can result in missed opportunities to grow and connect with customers. Agentforce 360 offers many use cases that help you address this challenge. Here are a few ways it can help you save time: [...] Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business. [...] ## 5. AI agents keep customers happy with 24/7 support\n\nCustomers expect quick, reliable support at any time of day. Agentforce 360 makes it possible to offer round-the-clock service without adding more staff or long hours to your day. Your customers will never be left hanging, even at midnight or on weekends. Agentforce 360 can handle all sorts of customer interactions, ranging from basic questions to more complex issues. It also learns from your data and customizes responses based on what each customer needs. This way, every interaction feels personal, but without the need for a human to be there every single time.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.\n\nDue to rounding, percentages may not always sum to 100 percent. [...] employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don&#x27;t anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don&#x27;t anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] All the survey findings discussed in the report, aside from two sidebars presenting international nuances, pertain solely to US workplaces. The findings are organized in this way because the responses from US employees and C-suite executives provide statistically significant conclusions about the US workplace. Analyzing global findings separately allows a comparison of differences between US responses and those from other regions.\n\nDue to rounding, percentages may not always sum to 100 percent. [...] employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent expect it in over 5 years, and 10 percent don&#x27;t anticipate employees will ever use gen AI for 30 percent of their work tasks. 3 percent of C-suite respondents are unsure. 34 percent of employees expect to use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their work tasks in less than a year, 37 percent within 1-5 years, 5 percent in over 5 years, and 7 percent don&#x27;t anticipate ever using it in this way. 4 percent of employees are unsure.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nRepetitive tasks kill your productivity. Agentforce 360 flips that story by stepping in where the busywork lives. Following up with leads no longer slows you down because Agentforce 360 keeps the conversation moving. Customer appointments stay on track with reminders and updates sent automatically. Even the more strategic moves, like building a close plan or suggesting the right product, happen faster because the heavy lifting is already done.\n\nStudies show that employees spend 58% of their workday on repetitive and mundane administrative tasks. For SMBs and startups, this can result in missed opportunities to grow and connect with customers. Agentforce 360 offers many use cases that help you address this challenge. Here are a few ways it can help you save time: [...] Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business. [...] ## 5. AI agents keep customers happy with 24/7 support\n\nCustomers expect quick, reliable support at any time of day. Agentforce 360 makes it possible to offer round-the-clock service without adding more staff or long hours to your day. Your customers will never be left hanging, even at midnight or on weekends. Agentforce 360 can handle all sorts of customer interactions, ranging from basic questions to more complex issues. It also learns from your data and customizes responses based on what each customer needs. This way, every interaction feels personal, but without the need for a human to be there every single time.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in 2026: Five Defining Themes&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The organizational shift will prove profound—from viewing AI as an independent tool to managing agents as digital coworkers requiring onboarding, performance reviews, and continuous improvement. HR and IT functions will collaborate on “digital workforce management” as organizations treat agentic governance as seriously as they do traditional workforce oversight.\n\n## 4. Intent-driven ERP and generative UI emerge as a new user experience [...] However, the proliferation of AI agents, many of which handle critical tasks and sensitive data, demands the development of new capabilities. Agentic governance will emerge as a critical capability as organizations deploy hundreds of specialized AI agents. The “agent sprawl” challenge will mirror previous shadow IT crises, but with higher stakes given agents’ autonomous decision-making capabilities. [...] AI-native architecture adds a continuously learning, agentic intelligence layer on top of deterministic systems, enabling applications to become intent-driven, context-aware, and self-improving rather than being statically coded around fixed workflows. Agentic systems will still only be as good as the context layer they can reliably retrieve and ground on. Here, organizations should invest in truly comprehensive, semantically rich knowledge graphs that provide a scalable source of context, making AI-native software dependable and self-improving.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;High turnover, ultimately, can impact shoppers. Attracting the right people, getting them up to speed quickly, and working to ensure they are productive as soon as possible are essential to the success of the business and the consumer experience. AI tools can guide employees on upcoming tasks or provide quick answers to operational questions, reducing the need for extensive training and allowing staff to operate more efficiently. As an added benefit, this can also free associates to engage directly with customers. For example, one grocer implemented a task management platform that resulted in over 80% of stores seeing increased task completion rates while averaging double-digit productivity gains.50 [...] ### Optimize supply chain\n\nThree in 10 retail executives plan to make significant technology investments to modernize their supply chain,51 such as unifying merchandising, supply chain, and store operations. These investments in technology and innovation should enable more effective decision-making and operational efficiency and address the demands of the fragmented consumer. For example, a lighting company is using AI to help manage seasonal demand, reduce costs, and maintain lean inventories across its network. In stores, AI is helping improve item picking and routing, streamlining workflows, and enhancing customer experiences.52\n\nRetail executives surveyed are focusing investments around: [...] As retailers struggle with the need to do more with less, automation and technology appear promising. Generative artificial intelligence, in particular, seems to be moving beyond the hype cycle and demonstrating concrete successes. Retailers that offered gen AI tools like chatbots during the Black Friday weekend noted a 15% better conversion rate,3 and 6 in 10 retail buyers said that AI-enabled tools improved demand forecasting and inventory management in 2024.4 With digital efficiency looming, 2025 could be a breakthrough year, including advancements in strategic arenas of merchandising, supply chain, and marketing. Seven in 10 retail executives expect to have AI capabilities in place within the year to help personalize experiences.5&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Today’s reality is starkly different.\n\nFifty-eight percent of enterprise IT decision-makers say their organizations are piloting AI agents, with the majority targeting process automation, workflow efficiencies, or customer service, among other use cases, according to AI adoption research published by Wharton and the GBK Collective.\n\nAgain, these are pilots — not production implementations. There isn’t yet a playbook for fully baked human-AI agent workflows. [...] ## The future looks bright(ish) — but unpredictable\n\nWhen the technical and process challenges are reconciled, HR and IT partnership will be essential in assisting the transition from humans to human-plus-machine work. Every company introducing AI agents to their organizations must become more intentional about how they execute their business processes and measure outcomes.\n\n“All of us in different functional domains need to up our game in intent-setting, boundary-setting, and measurement,” Hjartar says. “That’s going to take many years for us.”\n\nYoung says that every company will proceed at their own pace, which will create new categories of haves and have nots — just like preceding paradigm shifts involving emerging technology. “Some will push hard to automate; others won’t.” [...] ## About\n\n## Policies\n\n## Our Network\n\n## More\n\n## Africa\n\n## Americas\n\n## Asia\n\n## Europe\n\n## Oceania\n\n## Topics\n\n## About\n\n## Policies\n\n## Our Network\n\n## More\n\nClint Boulton\n\n# Your agentic AI strategy’s missing link: Human resources\n\n## As with previous tech transitions, IT and HR must collaborate to soften the impact of AI-fueled transformation on employees — and prepare them to be impactful agent colleagues.\n\nphoto illustration of a humanoid AI robot as an HR associate\n\nTech industry sentiment suggests that AI agents will automate entire business processes, potentially transforming companies worldwide.\n\nToday’s reality is starkly different.&quot;,

Without the right tools, AI-driven interactions become a black box, invisible to traditional supervision methods.\n\nThis creates a critical risk: AI agents might mishandle sensitive or high-stakes conversations — emotionally charged situations, payment disputes, complex technical issues — leading to negative customer experiences that damage brand reputation.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 Ways Agentforce 360 is Helping Small Businesses and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\n## 3. Fully scale without a full budget\n\nAs your customer base grows, your team shouldn’t have to burn out to keep up. Agentforce 360 acts as a digital extension of your workforce, allowing your startup to maintain a “small team feel” even as you reach enterprise-level volume. Here’s how it helps you scale smartly and affordably:\n\nDrastically reduce overhead: Startups often struggle with “software sprawl.” By using Salesforce for small business, you get elite AI capabilities and automation directly within your CRM. This eliminates the need for multiple expensive third-party tools and keeps your tech stack lean. [...] Agentforce 360 is the comprehensive platform that unifies AI agents, human employees, and company data into a single, trusted ecosystem. The Agentforce 360 Platform is available to try for free and depends on your level of needs to get started.\n\nLet’s get to the six ways Agentforce 360 is helping startups all over the globe:\n\n## AI Synopsis\n\n## 1. One tool to manage it all\n\n## AI Synopsis\n\nStartups today are turning to holistic customer relationship management (CRM) tools that bring every team onto one platform. When customer data is unified and easy to access, it becomes far more useful. This kind of foundation is what makes AI tools like Agentforce 360 truly effective, turning clean, connected data into insights and actions that fuel growth. [...] Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents designed to handle business tasks independently. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid scripts or “Copilots” that require a human to drive every step, Agentforce analyzes a customer’s request and determine the best course of action.\n\nThey don’t just answer questions; they can execute tasks like updating a CRM record, processing a refund, or scheduling a sales meeting. Using Data 360, they pull from your company’s real-time, trusted data to ensure their responses are accurate and relevant to your specific business.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in 2026: Five Defining Themes&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organizations that thrive will be those that recognize this shift and build an enterprise that is purpose-built for AI: establishing robust governance to manage a new, collaborative workforce of humans and AI agents; embracing gen UI to lower adoption barriers and an intent-driven user experience that helps employees interact naturally; seeking out specialized foundation models that are precisely tuned for enterprise use cases to drive business value; and, finally, building applications natively around AI that combine reasoning, business rules, and data, delivering proactive insights and automation. [...] The organizational shift will prove profound—from viewing AI as an independent tool to managing agents as digital coworkers requiring onboarding, performance reviews, and continuous improvement. HR and IT functions will collaborate on “digital workforce management” as organizations treat agentic governance as seriously as they do traditional workforce oversight.\n\n## 4. Intent-driven ERP and generative UI emerge as a new user experience [...] Enterprise applications will increasingly be built natively around AI capabilities, featuring user experiences designed for multi-model, natural language interaction; AI agents reasoning through complex processes; and a foundation managing foundation models, services, and a knowledge graph capturing semantically rich business data. AI-native architecture also enables more employees to create apps—such as smaller, ad-hoc productivity applications—in a matter of minutes without straining IT.&quot;,

From unlocking enterprise value with agentic AI and elevating next-generation leadership to building resilience for growth amid geopolitical volatility, they’ll explore what will likely shape the global business landscape in 2026.\n\nRegister here [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024. [...] The ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an _AI bot_ could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data—including voice messages, text, and technical specifications—to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an _AI agent_ can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take afterward—for example, processing a payment, checking for fraud, and completing a shipping action.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;• Robust guardrails and regularly reviewed governance policies for GenAI and AI agents, particularly regarding autonomous decision-making and operational integration.\n• Change management, skills development, and cultural transformation to maximise the benefits of AI adoption including increasing return on investment ROI and productivity.\n• Human-centred leadership in an AI-driven world, ensuring that empathy, sound judgement, and relationship-building remain core to decision-making and organisational culture – even as technology reshapes work and learning.\n• Ongoing board and workforce education on AI and emerging technologies, using external expertise where needed.\n03 Data governance Consider the adequacy of the company’s data governance framework and processes. [...] AI is transforming businesses, bringing significant opportunities but also complex risks – ranging from data accuracy and cybersecurity to regulatory compliance and reputational concerns.\nBoards should consider: • Whether the organisation has the right mix of skills and mindset to deliver in an AI-driven environment, and how to support leaders and staff in adapting to rapid technological change through upskilling and cultural transformation.\n• The potential for AI to disrupt or replace core services, and the implications for workforce requirements, recruitment strategies, and the future of the workplace.\n• Governance structures, risk management, trust and workforce needs around AI deployment. [...] The explosive growth in the use of AI and broader use of technology, is prompting more rigorous assessments of companies’ data governance frameworks and processes. Companies usually design ones suited to their industry and specific needs, but several established frameworks are available for consideration. They vary in many respects, but generally focus on data quality, data privacy and security, data stewardship, and data management.\nBoards may consider how frameworks: • Define data collection, storage, management, and usage.\n• Assign responsibility for data governance across the enterprise, including the roles of chief information officer, chief information security officer, and chief compliance officer (or those performing similar functions).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Work Trends 2026: Strategic Insights for CHROs&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI was supposed to make work easier. Instead, in many organizations, it’s creating workslop: low-quality output that employees spend hours fixing. Productivity suffers, and so does confidence in the technology. Meanwhile, hiring has become an AI arms race, with candidates and recruiters locked in a cycle of tech-driven one-upmanship. The result? Rising fraud and falling trust, with Gartner predicting that a quarter of candidate profiles could be fake by 2028. [...] And as if that wasn’t enough, insider threats and AI-powered espionage are moving from fiction to fact, putting sensitive data — and reputations — at risk. CHROs can’t leave these challenges to IT alone. They need to champion smarter AI adoption, restore authenticity in recruiting and embed security awareness into culture. The organizations that succeed will be those that treat trust and vigilance as strategic assets, not afterthoughts.\n\n### Seizing hidden opportunities for the human-machine workforce [...] Amid the uncertainty, opportunity is everywhere. As white-collar roles face disruption, workers are eyeing “AI-proof” careers in skilled trades — 62% say they’d make the switch for better pay and stability. That’s a talent pipeline waiting to be tapped, if CHROs can offer reskilling and clear career paths. At the same time, the race for technical AI skills is proving short-sighted. The real differentiator? Employees who can rethink processes end-to-end, not just master the latest tool.&quot;,

It has been working with customers during development but declined to share specific performance metrics they achieved. The newly announced capabilities will begin rolling out during the first six months of 2026.\n\n##### Photo: Pixabay\n\n# A message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

[...] “AI and the power of agentic AI, in particular, is reshaping the way things can be done,” said Balaji Balasubramanian, president and chief product officer for customer experience and consumer industries at SAP. “From planning through execution to driving great customer experiences, this is a fully end-to-end closed-loop retail system.”\n\n### Data foundation\n\nA central element of the announcement is a new Retail Intelligence component of the SAP Business Data Cloud. SAP said the offering is designed to unify data from sales, inventory, customers and suppliers across SAP and third-party systems, enabling AI-driven simulations for demand and inventory planning. [...] The new features differ from prior SAP analytics tools by using AI to connect front-end customer engagement with back-end planning and execution. “Organic traffic at the top of the funnel is collapsing, and influence is shifting toward other channels such as answer engines and large language models,” he said. “These are influencing where users are going.”\n\nSAP also announced AI-assisted assortment management within its S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition for retail and fashion customers. The feature allows planners to create or modify assortments using natural language through SAP’s Joule assistant.&quot;,

Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen.\n\nLarco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;OpenAI to acquire the team behind executive coaching AI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Rebecca Bellan\n\n10:11 AM PST · January 8, 2026\n\n[](\n\nOpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.\n\nConvogo’s product will be wound down. [...] San Francisco|October 13-15, 2026\n\nWAITLISTNOW\n\nThe Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&amp;A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware.\n\nTopics\n\nacqui-hire, AI, convogo, Mergers and Acquisitions, OpenAI, Startups\n\n[](\n\nImage 4: Rebecca Bellan\n\n Rebecca Bellan \n\nSenior Reporter\n\n[](\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence. Her work has also appeared in Forbes, Bloomberg, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and other publications. [...] “We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”\n\nThe Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024. [...] The ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an _AI bot_ could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data—including voice messages, text, and technical specifications—to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an _AI agent_ can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take afterward—for example, processing a payment, checking for fraud, and completing a shipping action. [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

That doesn’t necessarily mean layoffs. In fact, those surveyed who expect to see the biggest productivity increases are the least likely to expect increased layoffs at their companies.27 Similarly, those who say they are outsourcing in 2026 are more likely to report a high return on investment from their AI investment in the talent domain.28 [...] ### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\nImage 32\n\nOrganizational simplicity may also be required for AI to produce maximum value. Flatter structures and end-to-end processes that cross traditional functions bring the data that fuels AI to centralized locations, allowing insights and decisions to flow more smoothly throughout the organization and the market to effectuate action.\n\nOutsourcing can also be a powerful organizational change agent. It can release organizational capacity to focus on growth, support faster incorporation of AI into processes, and facilitate risk-sharing with a third party. Six in 10 executives (59%) in our survey are outsourcing core functions or forming centers of excellence.\n\n### 5. Growth is decoupling from hiring&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024. [...] window, code execution capabilities, and Gemma 2 are available today,” blog entry by Logan Kilpatrick, Shrestha Basu Mallick, and Ronen Kofman, June 27, 2024. Overall, we see five big innovations for business that are driving the next wave of impact: enhanced intelligence and reasoning capabilities, agentic AI, multimodality, improved hardware innovation and computational power, and increased transparency.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Architecture of AI-Human Teams&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## The Bottom Line\n\nIn the age where “learning how to learn” has been identified as an essential skill, organisations require a combination of learning infrastructure, human empathy and cross-functional visibility to ensure harmony between people and generative tools. The teams that succeed will be those who embrace AI with courage and challenge, whilst never losing sight of the human edge. Redefine roles, invest in complementary skills, break down silos and avoid the trap of blind adoption. These aren’t optional steps; they’re the foundation for resilience and innovation in an AI-driven world. If your AI strategy doesn’t include a human strategy, it’s incomplete.\n\n## Our advisory insights\n\n### Something went wrong\n\n###### Oops!! Something went wrong, please try again\n\nMTD TEST [...] Other businesses are rethinking their entire strategy, by boldly resisting non-human generation and banking on brainpower to make authentic appeals to clients. One thing is evident: inviting AI into the office without the right infrastructure and skills can unleash communication issues, risk sensitive data and create an identity crisis for staff.\n\nThe question is: what does it mean to be human in a team leveraging AI – and what core components are needed for firms to create opportunity instead of unleashing chaos?\n\n## Humans as orchestrators [...] According to the KPMG Trust and AI report - based on external market research across organisations - half of employees say they now use AI instead of collaborating with peers or supervisors, and one in five report reduced communication, interaction and co‑creation at work. As AI adoption accelerates, collaborators need new scaffolding to ensure that outputs are visible, auditable and reflect diverse perspectives. AI-human teams should consider:\n\n###### Cross-functional squads\n\nJoint-up teams can utilise tools to create transparent, cross-functional environments and seek to leverage new minds outside of your immediate team.\n\n###### Adaptive learning models\n\nBy providing a diverse range of data across teams, models can learn more and gain a broader understanding of unique situations.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Work Trends 2026: Strategic Insights for CHROs&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At the same time, performance pressure is quietly reshaping culture. Employees feel the strain when stated values don’t match day-to-day realities, and trust erodes fast. Add to that the mental toll of near-ubiquitous GenAI adoption (stress, burnout, even cognitive decline), and it’s clear that the human side of transformation needs urgent attention. CHROs who lead with transparency, empathy and proactive well-being strategies will help their organizations navigate this messy middle without losing their people.\n\n### Mitigating emerging threats to organizational performance [...] AI was supposed to make work easier. Instead, in many organizations, it’s creating workslop: low-quality output that employees spend hours fixing. Productivity suffers, and so does confidence in the technology. Meanwhile, hiring has become an AI arms race, with candidates and recruiters locked in a cycle of tech-driven one-upmanship. The result? Rising fraud and falling trust, with Gartner predicting that a quarter of candidate profiles could be fake by 2028. [...] Amid the uncertainty, opportunity is everywhere. As white-collar roles face disruption, workers are eyeing “AI-proof” careers in skilled trades — 62% say they’d make the switch for better pay and stability. That’s a talent pipeline waiting to be tapped, if CHROs can offer reskilling and clear career paths. At the same time, the race for technical AI skills is proving short-sighted. The real differentiator? Employees who can rethink processes end-to-end, not just master the latest tool.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit depicts the share of US employees who highly trust different institutions to deploy gen AI tools responsibly, safely, and ethically. The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent).

This image description was completed with the assistance of [...] Image description ends.\n\n### Leaders can invest more in their employees\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in _Superagency_. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit). [...] The scatter plot displays business functions: sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, R&amp;D, legal, risk, and compliance, operations, HR, strategy, supply chain, finance, procurement, and IT. Each function is represented by a data point, with its horizontal position indicating the percentage of employees expressing a positive outlook on gen AI, and its vertical position representing the potential economic value of gen AI in those functions, in trillions of dollars. Sales and marketing shows the highest potential economic value and around 50 percent of employees with a positive outlook. Software engineering is the function with second-highest economic potential from gen AI, with again about 50 percent of employees in that function reporting being optimistic about gen AI.&quot;,

Building on $3 billion already committed, the initiative aligns with national ambitions for inclusive growth and innovation.\n\nJuan Montes  -  Microsoft writer\n\n## Kilimo turns data and AI into water savings [...] AI is evolving fast, but what if our biggest breakthroughs come from rethinking how we build it? Jaron Lanier, Microsoft’s prime unifying scientist, explores why the future of AI isn’t about creating autonomous machines; it’s about designing systems that reflect and elevate human values. He argues that trust, context and creativity matter just as much as models and metrics, and that recognizing the people behind the data is key to building responsible technology.

Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s CMO of AI at Work, says the real differentiation for companies in this era of AI isn’t speed; it’s learning. Companies on the cutting edge are adapting quickly to reshape workflows and embrace the idea that when you invest in a technology this foundational, productivity almost always dips before it rises. As AI rewrites how organizations operate, Spataro says leaders should ask themselves these four questions as they head into 2026.\n\nMicrosoft Signal\n\n## AI with the assist, on and off the court&quot;,

Neuroscience can provide a powerful lens for a better understanding of many of these human factors.\n\n## From insight to action—applying neuroscience to boardroom decision-making\n\nThe following interventions directly target the brain’s neural mechanisms to restore clarity, composure, and connection under pressure:\n\nPause—embed reflection into board decisions\n\nFocus—structure board work to sharpen attention&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By the end of the decade, Accenture had established itself as a leader in digital and cloud services, while continuing to provide large-scale outsourcing and systems integration. Revenues and headcount surged as the company embraced emerging technologies and new service lines.\n\nIn the 2020s, Accenture made artificial intelligence (AI) and data central to its strategy. In 2023, the company said it would open six generative AI studios in North America, part of a planned network of 10 worldwide, and spend $3 billion over three years on deploying AI. [...] In early 2024, it expanded that plan to include nine additional studios in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The company also continued to grow through acquisitions in technology, design, and marketing. In June 2025, Accenture said it planned to consolidate its five main business divisions—Strategy and Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X, and Song—into a new umbrella unit called Reinvention Services, effective September 1.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Think of it this way: Traditional AI is the assistant waiting for your next command. Agentic AI is the teammate who flags problems before they escalate and suggests next steps you might not have seen. Like any new team member, it needs onboarding. Done right, it becomes a trusted partner that manages operational tasks, surfaces new insights, or alerts you when something’s off.\n\nNearly nine in ten HR professionals using AI in recruiting say it saves time, and more than one in three reports reduced hiring costs2. Agentic AI is already being piloted across HR, finance, technology, and other support functions. We’ve seen AI agents draft onboarding plans, schedule interviews, and even detect early signs of burnout based on behavioral signals. This evolution is well underway. [...] #### Conclusion\n\nAgentic AI isn’t a side experiment or an upgrade in automation. It’s your next generation of talent. And like any new generation, it brings new ways of working, new expectations, and a lot of potential.The real challenge isn’t adoption; it’s building the structures that let your organization manage AI agents effectively and capture their full value.This is about people, process, and performance, not just tools. Developing capability in prompting, data judgment, and oversight is a need as these will define who thrives in this new landscape and who gets left behind.\n\nSo go check in on Eli. Make sure it has what it needs to succeed. Recognize the value it’s already bringing. And get ready to build teams where humans and agents collaborate seamlessly. [...] This article explores how Agentic AI is transforming organizations, and why HR must take the lead. The central questions are: Are HR professionals ready to work alongside AI agents? And what kind of collaborators do we want them to be?\n\n#### What is Agentic AI and why does it matter?\n\nChances are, you already use AI every day, through tools like ChatGPT, automated workflows, or recommendation engine. Agentic AI takes it further, designed from the start by HR’s scope, priorities, and values. Unlike traditional AI, which waits for instructions, agentic systems can act, choosing when and how to execute tasks.&quot;,

[...] Deloitte intends to use Zora AI for Finance internally to streamline and automate its finance processes including expense management, a common challenge for many organizations, and one of many agents Deloitte plans to implement to transform its business with agentic AI. Zora expense management agents can monitor expenses across payroll, facilities, sales and marketing, and employee time and expenses, enabling finance leaders to identify expense outliers, compare expenses against industry and competitor trends, and drill down into specific budgets. Zora AI is expected to liberate thousands of hours of effort a year for Deloitte’s finance team with our targets to reduce costs by 25% and increase productivity by 40%.

Worker and AI skills and capabilities are dynamically adjusted in a dynamic \ncapability ecosystem that helps organizations make the shift out of job-based structures.\n\nAgents will be able to help dynamically orchestrate resources, helping inform long-term workforce planning and potential role redesign based on identified patterns.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Deloitte unveils insights on the accelerating adoption of ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Even with these barriers, Deloitte observes that physical AI is spreading beyond the usual industrial settings:\n\n##### \n\n##### Humanoid robots and what comes next\n\nHumanoid robots are presented as the next major step. Their human-like shape and dexterity matter for a practical reason: they can move through spaces designed for people—factories, warehouses, offices, homes—without expensive redesigning. As AI reasoning and “agentic” systems improve, these robots are becoming better at planning multi-step tasks, adjusting to unfamiliar situations, and recovering when something goes wrong. [...] Въпреки тези бариери, Deloitte отбелязва, че физическият AI навлиза извън традиционните индустрии:\n\nХуманоидни роботи и бъдещето\n\nХуманоидните роботи са следващата голяма стъпка. Човекоподобната форма има практическо значение: те могат да се движат в пространства - фабрики, складове, офиси, домове - без нуждата от скъпи преустройства. С подобряването на AI за планиране и адаптивност, тези роботи стават по-добри в изпълнението на сложни задачи, справянето с непознати ситуации и възстановяването при грешки. [...] Deloitte Tech Trends подчертава как физическият изкуствен интелект (AI) превръща традиционните роботи в системи, които могат да се учат, да се адаптират и да работят безопасно в реални условия. Вместо да разчитат само на фиксирани, предварително програмирани стъпки, тези машини реагират на случващото се около тях. Резултатът е по-висока безопасност, прецизност и ефективност в редица индустрии.\n\nDeloitte отбелязва, че секторът преминава от малки пилотни проекти към мащабно внедряване – важна промяна, която може да преобрази начина, по който хората и машините работят в реална среда.\n\nФизическият AI: мост между дигиталния интелект и физическия свят&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;High turnover, ultimately, can impact shoppers. Attracting the right people, getting them up to speed quickly, and working to ensure they are productive as soon as possible are essential to the success of the business and the consumer experience. AI tools can guide employees on upcoming tasks or provide quick answers to operational questions, reducing the need for extensive training and allowing staff to operate more efficiently. As an added benefit, this can also free associates to engage directly with customers. For example, one grocer implemented a task management platform that resulted in over 80% of stores seeing increased task completion rates while averaging double-digit productivity gains.50 [...] As retailers struggle with the need to do more with less, automation and technology appear promising. Generative artificial intelligence, in particular, seems to be moving beyond the hype cycle and demonstrating concrete successes. Retailers that offered gen AI tools like chatbots during the Black Friday weekend noted a 15% better conversion rate,3 and 6 in 10 retail buyers said that AI-enabled tools improved demand forecasting and inventory management in 2024.4 With digital efficiency looming, 2025 could be a breakthrough year, including advancements in strategic arenas of merchandising, supply chain, and marketing. Seven in 10 retail executives expect to have AI capabilities in place within the year to help personalize experiences.5 [...] Engaging experiences: Four in 10 executives plan to engage customers through improved shopping experiences.25 AI and machine learning (ML) present significant opportunities for enhancing customer engagement, especially for precision targeting and ad curation. For instance, a denim retailer piloted a jeans fit guide via an interactive voice questionnaire, enhancing personalized online shopping experiences down to individual waistlines.26 Others are investing in interactive displays and digital signage to offer in-store personalized recommendations and product information.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As use cases grow, challenges around risk, skills, and collaboration intensify. With linear workflows giving way to agent-driven designs, HR operating models must stay flexible to adapt continuously.\n\nThe graphic shows how companies can scale their HR operating models with agentic AI. Challenges include increasing compliance risks, lack of relevant skills and employee reluctance, and organizational silos hindering teamwork. Three recommended steps are: 1. Redesign end-to-end processes around agents, 2. Integrate responsible AI practices with human oversight and motivate and upskill employees, 3. Evolve flexible organizational structures for cross-functional collaboration. \n\nClick to increase view\n\n Activate to open full-size image in lightbox overlay [...] In recruiting, for instance, AI agents can plan searches, screen CVs, score candidates, schedule interviews, validate skills and draft recommendations for candidate selections, adapting shortlists based on recruiter feedback and continuously optimizing alignment with company goals and recruiter feedback. The shift is less about a setting up a single “super agent”, and more about carefully scaled individual agents for HR key areas that keep humans in the loop where judgment and context matters (e.g., talent sourcing, L&amp;D, HR ticket resolution).\n\nBecause it unites autonomy, learning, and orchestration, agentic AI can already support more than 70% of HR processes. The gains vary by process: some primarily deliver FTE reduction, others improve service quality, and some unlock both. [...] ## What good looks like in practice\n\nLeading HR functions are already piloting focused agentic AI solutions that can be scaled to end-to-end workflows if successful.\n\nThe infographic depicts how Agentic AI supports the sourcing process. HR employees define requirements, review candidate pools, prioritize candidates, and manage communication. AI agents automate profile optimization, data collection and evaluation, shortlist adjustments, and two-way communication, using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), analytical AI, and generative AI.

[...] ## Where AI agents deliver the most HR value\n\nBuilding on our expertise in implementing AI agents and transforming work, we leveraged PwC’s HR taxonomy (our Global People Process Framework) to analyze 300+ subprocesses across the hire-to-retire lifecycle. While select tasks remain human-led, more than half of the operational work can be agent-assisted or fully agent-driven. Let’s take a look at some of our findings. [...] You still have a chance to move faster than your competition. In PwC’s AI Agent Survey, 79% of executives say that AI agents are already being adopted in their companies. But only 40% are using them in HR.\n\n## Why AI agents are an HR breakthrough\n\nEven after decades of automation and outsourcing, day-to-day operational demands still weigh you down — limiting the value you can create for the business. But now, from recruiting to payroll, benefits administration to workforce planning, AI agents can take on high-volume tasks that legacy technologies couldn’t reach.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;PwC addresses this gap through a holistic workforce strategy. With more than 3,200 AI champions and tailored training programs, the firm keeps human expertise at the core of its AI transformation. Agents are designed to augment, not replace, human workers, enabling staff to move from low-value tasks to strategic, higher-impact roles. Matt Wood noted at the event that “AI is driving the cost of programming down to zero, but the value of engineering and business problem-solving is going up.”\n\n### Looking ahead: Multi-agent orchestration and competitive differentiation [...] One of PwC’s latest offerings, Agent Powered Performance, exemplifies this strategic vision. Integrated with agent OS, it embeds AI agents directly into core enterprise systems such as enterprise resource management and customer relationship management. These agents follow a “Sense, Think, Act” model: They continuously monitor value leakage, reason over predictive models and benchmarks and execute improvements directly inside operational tools. [...] PwC’s clients are not alone in this ambition. According to PwC’s May 2025 AI Agent Survey, 88% of senior executives plan to increase their AI-related budgets over the next year, and nearly four in five (79%) report AI agents are already in use within their companies. However, the real opportunity lies ahead: Just 35% say they’ve adopted agents broadly, and fewer than half have rethought how work will be fundamentally structured.\n\n### PwC’s strategic response: Architecting AI for real outcomes&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;But agentic AI may open a realm of new possibilities, ushering in a new era of more autonomous workforce planning. Unlike traditional AI models that passively process data and execute preprogrammed instructions, agentic AI possesses the ability to take initiative, make autonomous decisions, and dynamically adapt to its environment. \n\n## Continuous scanning for signals and patterns\n\nAI agents can continuously monitor and scan for signals and changes in real time, alerting humans or other AI agents when a change occurs. [...] ## Dynamic allocation of capabilities and resources\n\nBased on a continuous scan of signals and demand and supply forecasting, AI agents can then suggest interventions and reallocations as needs evolve. Organizations can dynamically match capabilities to work and adjust workforce strategy (build, buy, borrow, bot) on demand. Worker and AI skills and capabilities are dynamically adjusted in a dynamic \ncapability ecosystem that helps organizations make the shift out of job-based structures.\n\nAgents will be able to help dynamically orchestrate resources, helping inform long-term workforce planning and potential role redesign based on identified patterns. Consider how AI agents are transforming logistics and supply chains, and how similar changes could be applied to the workforce. \n\n|  | [...] |  |\n\n| Go Deeper Learn more about how workforce planning can transform into a key differentiator:  Reinventing workforce planning for an AI-powered, uncertain world, Deloitte Insights / Sue Cantrell et al., 2025. |\n\n#WorkforcePlanning\n\n#WorkforceTransformation\n\n#FutureOfTheWorkforce\n\nDid you find this insight useful?\n\nYou may also be interested in\n\n6 findings for increasing value from learning: L&amp;D as administrator\n\nExplore the key findings from our High-Impact Learning Organization research.\n\nVIDEO |  Dec 19, 2025\n\nResearch Roundup\n\nSeason&#x27;s greetings!

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.\n\n&gt; So I think we are going into a world where you’ll have to think about your workforce as both agentic and human.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jorge Amar&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The effects of agentic AI will also trickle up to the C-suite, with CIOs likely to champion even closer alignment and integration with business leaders across finance, HR, procurement, supply chain, sales and marketing, and other functional areas. Given the embedded nature of AI agents in business processes, IT teams are likely to become more focused on these functions.\n\nWith agents taking on many programming and data science activities, it will be important for technologists to gain a deeper understanding of business processes so they can tailor agentic products accordingly, says Brenna. [...] This shift will require a new discovery and operating model to ensure people can find the right agents to help them do their jobs. “As agents evolve, they may need to be managed like humans, with IT serving as an HR-like function for agents,” Elliott says. Andreas Welsch, chief AI strategist at AI consultancy Intelligence Briefing, advocates for an “Agent Resources” department that draws on traditional HR principles to define the roles of agents and measure their performance.\n\n## 5. How does agentic AI change collaboration between CIOs and their C-suite colleagues? [...] ## 2. How do we prioritize use cases for agentic AI?\n\nCIOs wary of disrupting business with AI pilots that target  vital operational areas such as ERP, human resources, sales or supply chain are getting an assist from software vendors that have been integrating AI agents into their enterprise applications. It’s a good place to start testing agentic AI’s capabilities.\n\n“Look at your core applications first, because they hold the data and the processes where agents can provide the most value,” says Sacolick. “Ultimately it comes down to where the user is.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Strategic workforce planning: With agentic AI, static approaches to workforce planning based on human roles will give way to dynamic, activity-based models that specify which tasks are performed by humans, AI agents, or hybrid teams. HR should reimagine workflows “AI first,” reshaping human activities and roles to optimize value from human-agent collaboration. With real-time data and analytics, HR can forecast workforce needs, identify existing and adjacent skills, and redeploy talent dynamically, supporting a more responsive, agile, and value-focused workforce plan to keep pace with change. [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Talent management: Career pathing will transition from hierarchical, linear models to fluid, outcome-focused trajectories, aligned with hybrid organizational requirements and hyper-personalized to individual employee needs (in service of business outcomes). New frameworks for performance management and incentive structures will reward outcomes, effective collaboration with AI agents, and innovation in hybrid workflows. Agentic AI systems can help employees to define better goals and career plans, while helping HR create more tailored performance approaches and data-informed succession plans.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;There are currently promising uses for agentic AI, however, as an emerging technology, not all have been tested at enterprise scale yet. [...] In contrast, agentic AI systems introduce adaptive, autonomous decision-making, bridging the gap between rigid automation and human-like reasoning. With minimal to no human intervention, AI agents perform specific tasks using capabilities that are integrated across multiple layers in the overall agentic system. [...] People are naturally skilled at recognizing patterns and making sense of chaos, even when information is disorganized or incomplete. However, comprehension doesn’t always strike immediately: We rely on books, online searches, and the wisdom of others to make more informed decisions that lead to better results. Generative AI follows a similar trajectory by retrieving information, generating insights, and sometimes taking actions — whether that’s analyzing a customer’s purchase history to recommend tailored products or automating essential tasks, such as sending emails and processing transactions.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] Jorge Amar: First, HR will need to be at least business proficient in what an agentic workforce can do. How can you drive a change management program if you don’t know what your agentic workforce can and cannot do, or what will be possible in three years?\n\nSecond, I think HR will play an important role in reskilling human employees. Today, you can probably fully agentize the workload of a level-one support engineer. But you might want to repurpose that person to become a prompt engineer or to do content generation for AI training. An HR function that can do that at scale is another critical component and skill set that HR will need to develop if you think about the next three, five years: “What is the evolution of that role?”&quot;,

This approach rethinks traditional talent management practices, recognizing AI agents as integral team members.\n\n&gt; 77% of executives believe that AI will necessitate significant investment in upskilling and reskilling programs for their workforce.v [...] ## Three Key Implications of Human-Digital Talent Strategies\n\nOur Mystro platform is designed to help organizations understand the impacts of AI agents on their workforce and assist in capturing value based on these insights. In our work with clients, our teams leverage Mystro to redefine roles, reshape organizational structures, and quantify the value derived from human and AI agent collaboration.\n\nFollowing are three key implications inherent in moving to a talent strategy that fully addresses agentic-AI disruption:\n\nImplication 1 | Intentionally orchestrate work across human and digital labor, keeping interaction models top of mind [...] Agents themselves will deliver real-time performance insights on how the human-digital workforce is performing. These insights may include productivity levels, task efficiency, employee engagement, skill utilization, and collaboration metrics. For example, AI agents can provide data on which tasks are best handled by digital labor versus human talent, how well employees are adapting to new technologies, or where skill gaps might exist. Organizations can use these insights to evaluate workforce needs, adjust talent management strategies, reassign resources as needed, and refine their workforce planning processes. This continuous adaptation and real-time responsiveness will help accelerate the pace of workforce planning and create a more agile and resilient workforce.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organization design\n\nTalent\n\nEmployee experience\n\nFor HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices that maintain trust. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business leaders to design the structures and operating models of tomorrow. [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# AI’s Human Impact: How Agentic Technology Is Reshaping Work\n\nAgentic AI’s Impact on the Workforce\n\nHR leaders plan to redeploy nearly a quarter of their workforce in the near future as AI agents — which are capable of resolving complex issues independently — take on more routine tasks. As a result, HR leaders expect a productivity boost of 30% per employee.\n\nThese findings come from a new Salesforce survey of 200 global HR executives. Leaders also projected a staggering 327% growth in agent adoption within their organizations by 2027, spiking from just 15% adoption today to 64% within two years. [...] This capability opens powerful new possibilities for reskilling and career mobility as the traditional job-title-based paradigm of recruiting gives way to a skills-based approach. This shift allows employers to identify transferable skills across seemingly unrelated professions‌, like recognizing how a barista’s attention to detail and customer service might make them an excellent candidate for a healthcare support role.\n\nThe AI-driven skills-based approach allows our customers to redeploy talent more effectively.\n\n“The AI-driven skills-based approach allows our customers to redeploy talent more effectively,” Fischer said. “It allows them to differentiate, because they’re better at providing higher quality services. It’s not just about efficiency, it’s also about quality.” [...] #### The path forward\n\nOrganizations that proactively plan for redeployment and reskilling will be best positioned to thrive. Yet the research shows that 85% of businesses have yet to implement agentic AI, and 73% of employees remain unclear about how digital labor will impact their daily work.\n\nThis awareness gap underscores the urgent need for robust communication and change management strategies to accompany technological implementation.\n\n“There’s a sense of fear around AI coming in, so you have to be transparent with your employees that things will change, but support them on that journey,” said Hickin. “The best change will happen when people feel a sense of autonomy and agency in changing their own jobs and experimenting with tools themselves.”\n\n#### More information:&quot;,

Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.\n\n&gt; So I think we are going into a world where you’ll have to think about your workforce as both agentic and human.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jorge Amar [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast&quot;,

With Mechele Dickerson\n\nClaire Jones talks to Mechele Dickerson, law professor at the University of Texas [...] The bigger problem though is the, again, the unpredictability and the precarity. So for my parents, it increases because of a cost of living. The employer was required to sort of guess how much money my parents would need each month based on their income when they were working, and they had to figure out a way to make sure there was enough money there to continue paying my parents and my parents are now almost 90.\n\nWell, for a worker now I’m expected to guess how much do I need to invest to make sure that I have enough money in the future based on how long I might live. Most workers are incapable of doing that, so we’ve shifted those risk away from businesses and employers on to employees, even though employees are simply not equipped to make those sorts of financial calculations. [...] Claire JonesYou know, since the 1980s, I think that’s a crucial time that you reflect on in the book. Government policies have tended to favour business interests over those of employees. How do you think that could be addressed to the benefit of the middle-class American?\n\nMechele DickersonI’ll focus on one thing, and that’s retirement.\n\nSo it used to be if you went to a company and you worked at the company and you stayed at the company for a long period of time, when you retired, you would have a pension. Well, in the 1980s, late 1970s, early 1980s, businesses decided that they could no longer afford to invest in the long-term retirement security of their workers.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organization design\n\nTalent\n\nEmployee experience\n\nFor HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices that maintain trust. [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Strategic workforce planning: With agentic AI, static approaches to workforce planning based on human roles will give way to dynamic, activity-based models that specify which tasks are performed by humans, AI agents, or hybrid teams. HR should reimagine workflows “AI first,” reshaping human activities and roles to optimize value from human-agent collaboration. With real-time data and analytics, HR can forecast workforce needs, identify existing and adjacent skills, and redeploy talent dynamically, supporting a more responsive, agile, and value-focused workforce plan to keep pace with change.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organization design\n\nTalent\n\nEmployee experience\n\nFor HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices that maintain trust. [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business leaders to design the structures and operating models of tomorrow.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As executives reflect on how agentic AI might shape their business, from competitive positioning to their talent model, they will have to consider how it challenges the fundamentals of their IT architecture. Agentic AI architecture builds on the rise of composable microservices architecture and the use of enterprise cloud services that many companies have already been investing in. But to fully capture the value while navigating the risks, they will need to rethink how AI is embedded across the architecture—the systems, processes, and governance. Enterprises need to ensure agents have the context they need in real time, the ability to observe and explain behavior, and the guardrails to execute safely, securely, and cost-effectively. Current architectures simply cannot handle this balance [...] Companies that don’t want to fall behind should be preparing and investing now: hiring and upskilling teams, embedding new capabilities, and understanding the necessary architectural changes. Those that wait will struggle to catch up. Agentic AI is already reshaping the enterprise, and only those that move decisively—redesigning their architecture, teams, and ways of working—will unlock its full value.\n\n Acknowledgments \n\n  David Crawford, chairman of Bain &amp; Company’s Global Technology, Media, and Telecommunications practice; Anne Hoecker, global leader of the TMT practice; and Dana Aulanier, practice vice president of the TMT practice, prepared this report. [...] Explore the report\n\nAgentic AI isn’t just another wave of automation; it’s a structural shift in enterprise technology, one with the potential to completely redefine how work gets done. Previous waves of automation tackled parts of processes, leaving exceptions where humans had to step in. AI agents can reason, collaborate, and coordinate actions, allowing them to accomplish complex, multistep, nondeterministic processes that have so far depended on humans.\n\nIt’s easy to see the transformative potential of this, from improved operational efficiency and customer experience to sharper decision making and beyond. Forward-looking leaders aren’t asking if agentic AI will reshape their business but how to prepare their organizations to deploy it safely and effectively.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.\n\n&gt; So I think we are going into a world where you’ll have to think about your workforce as both agentic and human.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jorge Amar [...] How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights&quot;,
