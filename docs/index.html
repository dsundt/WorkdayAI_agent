This relative quiet follows recent major developments, such as the now widely discussed <a href="https://en-gb.newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday/Microsoft announcement</a> on a unified AI agent experience (September 2025), and the increasing deployment conversations among GSIs and ecosystem partners. The current lull is not unexpected post-earnings and product-cycle cadence, but it is strategically important for Deloitte and its clients to recognize that competitive moves may surface with minimal notice. This window provides an optimal period for Workday ecosystem partners and practices to double down on enablement, skills elevation, and risk awareness, ensuring readiness for rapid product pivots and client demand surges once the next wave of launches hits. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, this is a prime moment for deep-dive enablement, client education, and internal upskilling on agentic AI, responsible AI, and Workday’s evolving API and extensibility models, especially as regulatory and bias-related litigation remains top of mind. <em>(Coverage period: 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02)</em></p></li></ul><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><strong>KPMG</strong>: Continued global promotion and enablement of agentic AI frameworks for HR consulting, including cross-industry seminars and client tours (latest: <a href="https://kpmg.com/nl/en/home/events/2026/02/agentic-ai-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agentic AI Tour Netherlands, Feb 2026</a>).<br /><p>KPMG is cementing itself as a thought leader in agentic AI enablement and operational playbooks for large enterprises. While little new has entered the public domain in the last 24 hours, ongoing workshops, seminars, and ecosystem amplification efforts underscore a significant shift in buyer conversations toward agentic capability assessments and opportunity identification. This creates urgency for Deloitte to accelerate its own enablement and client-facing narratives around Workday-based agentic AI, both to defend existing client relationships and capture new transformation opportunities driven by AI-first mandates.

While little new has entered the public domain in the last 24 hours, ongoing workshops, seminars, and ecosystem amplification efforts underscore a significant shift in buyer conversations toward agentic capability assessments and opportunity identification. This creates urgency for Deloitte to accelerate its own enablement and client-facing narratives around Workday-based agentic AI, both to defend existing client relationships and capture new transformation opportunities driven by AI-first mandates.
