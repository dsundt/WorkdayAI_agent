<ul>
<li><strong>Workday Introduces New Custom AI Model Library to Power Smarter, Faster Contract Reviews (Published 2025-10-22):</strong>
<p>Workday unveiled its Custom AI Model Library to accelerate contract reviews through intelligent, enterprise-ready document automation in its HCM and finance platforms. The Library allows organizations to build and deploy custom AI models for contract analysis, improving speed, accuracy, and compliance while reducing manual workload. By reinforcing competitive differentiation with configurable, responsible AI, Workday positions itself to address complex contract analytics needs across industries. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Workday’s Custom AI Model Library Makes Headlines in Analyst Coverage (Published 2025-10-22):</strong>
<p>Leading analyst and financial media underscored the industry impact of Workday’s custom AI release, citing heightened enterprise demand for vertical-specific document intelligence and operational transparency. This move marks a shift toward platform configurability in SaaS AI, requiring clients to focus on governance and change management as they scale AI-driven document workflows. It also opens up new engagement opportunities for service partners able to guide safe and auditable custom AI adoption <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510220915PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA03481-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(source)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAP:</strong> SAP is developing its agentic AI workflows across SuccessFactors, targeting HR and procurement automations. While advanced in integration, SAP has not yet matched Workday’s depth in custom contract AI. Clients should be aware of this point of differentiation as the competitive contract analytics race evolves.</li>
<li><strong>Dayforce:</strong> Dayforce is expanding its AI agents for workforce automation, gaining ground in payroll but lacking Workday’s current level of model customization. Deloitte teams should support clients in evaluating fit-for-purpose agent strategies and ecosystem interoperability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI Model Customization &amp; Governance in Workday: <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday</a> — Outcome: Advisors can guide the build and lifecycle management of custom AI for document workflows.</li>
<li>Responsible AI Implementation in SaaS HR/Finance: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Responsible AI Governance</a> — Outcome: Teams are ready to support clients with implementation best practices in risk, ethics, and change management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop client- and internal-facing briefings on Workday’s Custom AI Model Library and its implications for contract automation.</li>
<li>Identify and contact Workday clients who can benefit from early pilots of the new capability.</li>
<li>Draft a point of view involving legal and risk functions on AI-powered document review protocols.</li>
<li>Engage with GSI and boutique partners for shared perspectives and adoption best practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Improper governance of custom models could create operational, reputational, or compliance risks.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Implement rigorous lifecycle management, audit trails, and escalation workflows for model outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Client confusion or inadequate use of custom model features.<br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Offer targeted enablement and training; run focused use case definition sessions to clarify value delivery and scope.</li>

Deepening Workday&#x27;s AI agent ecosystem, this move supports differentiation in the contract automation space amid intensifying competition from SAP, Oracle, Dayforce, and ServiceNow.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Introduces New Custom AI Model Library to Power Smarter, Faster Contract Reviews (Published 2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday has unveiled a Custom AI Model Library designed explicitly to power more intelligent and rapid contract reviews within its HCM and finance platforms. According to the official release, the new library enables organizations to leverage tailored AI models that automate complex contract analysis, clause identification, and risk flagging, accelerating legal and procurement processes. The initiative is a direct response to growing enterprise demand for solutions that slash manual review time for increasingly complex contracts, which can create bottlenecks in procurement, compliance, and vendor management flows. \\n\\nThis move is strategically significant: it deepens Workday’s AI agent architecture and positions the platform as a core enabler of automated, agentic workflows, which many GSIs and ecosystem partners are focusing on for 2026 transformation programs. Technically, the library allows customers to train and deploy custom models while maintaining compliance with enterprise security and responsible AI mandates. Competitively, it sets Workday apart from SAP, Oracle, and Dayforce, whose AI efforts to date have been more generalized or less integrated into native workflow systems. \\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this advance enables new advisory opportunities, including guiding clients on designing, training, and deploying bespoke document AI. It also reinforces the critical need for data governance, model validation, and change management in scaling agentic AI use cases across contract, compliance, and HR domains.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-10-22-Workday-Introduces-New-Custom-AI-Model-Library-to-Power-Smarter,-Faster-Contract-Reviews\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s Custom AI Model Library Makes Headlines in Analyst Coverage (Published 2025-10-22)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Analyst and media coverage has quickly followed Workday’s announcement, with market commentators emphasizing how the AI Model Library could catalyze industry-wide change. The Financial Times highlighted that the release responds to demands from legal and procurement teams who need vertical-specific AI automations, not just generic language models, to manage risk and negotiate with speed at scale. These sources also note the broader context: as more enterprises turn to AI agents for operational efficiency, sector incumbents must provide tools allowing customers to develop and operationalize their own AI rather than only using off-the-shelf models. \\n\\nStrategically, this signals a shift towards &#x27;AI as a configuration layer&#x27; in enterprise SaaS, where platforms compete on the flexibility and trustworthiness of their embedded AI. For existing and prospective Workday clients, this means an ability to go beyond standard benchmarks in document automation, using secure and auditable AI that can be customized to their regulatory and workflow context. Deloitte teams should note that advisory on governance frameworks and risk mitigation will be in high demand as clients navigate the opportunities and compliance demands of deploying customized AI agents in real-world environments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510220915PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA03481-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP has continued developing agentic AI workflows within its SuccessFactors suite, emphasizing integration with procurement and workforce tools to automate HR and financial processes.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;While SAP&#x27;s approach remains strong in process integration, it has not yet introduced a comparable custom AI model library for contracts at the depth of Workday’s new solution.
