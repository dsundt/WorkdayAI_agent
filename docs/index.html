    <strong>Unit 42 Report: AI and Attack Surface Complexity Fuel Majority of Emerging Security Risks (2026-02-17)</strong>
    <p>The February 17, 2026 Unit 42 report highlights the increasing complexity of cybersecurity risks in AI-driven cloud environments. As SaaS solutions like Workday integrate agentic AI across HR and operational use cases, the scope for potential attacks grows. The report stresses the role of human error and lax controls as leading vulnerabilities. For Workday, this means that robust security and transparency must anchor every phase of agentic deployment. Deloitte’s Workday practice should respond by expanding AI risk workshops, incorporating security threat modeling, and embedding best practices into every client delivery.

    <strong>Infosys and Anthropic Announce Collaboration for Advanced AI Value Creation (2026-02-16)</strong>
    <p>Infosys and Anthropic announced a deep partnership aimed at bringing advanced, safe AI capabilities into enterprise SaaS platforms. Infosys, a leading Workday integrator, is leveraging Anthropic’s responsible AI models to push new agentic features, particularly in workflow automation and HR services. For Workday users and Deloitte, this partnership is a signal that the bar for responsible, composable, and ethical agentic AI deployments is rising. This may trigger more competitive RFPs and elevate client expectations for AI safety and interoperability in Workday deployments.

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>KPMG:</strong> KPMG in Canada's Agentic AI Engine, launched in April 2025, is making inroads in automating HR and operations. This places pressure on Workday and partners to demonstrate highly-governed automation, transparent oversight, and responsible agent deployment. Deloitte can differentiate by explicitly addressing AI auditability, controls, and cross-SaaS automation. (<a href="https://kpmg.com/ca/en/home/media/press-releases/2025/04/kpmg-in-canada-launches-agentic-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accenture:</strong> Accenture is aggressively targeting regulated enterprise AI with OpenAI-powered agentic solutions, spotlighting the importance of end-to-end process transparency and compliance within complex SaaS environments. Deloitte’s Workday team should focus on audit-ready, scenario-driven implementations to stay ahead of this market play. (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/ae-en/services/ecosystem-partners/openai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Getting Started with AI in Workday:</strong> Master essential AI strategy in Workday projects and lead client workshops. <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-in/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/getting-started-with-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Link</a> – Outcome: Core team members deploy agentic AI with client-facing authority and foundational expertise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Responsible AI and Bias Mitigation:</strong> Access Workday’s official guidelines to address AI bias in HCM deployments. <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/responsible-ai-and-bias-mitigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Link</a> – Outcome: Ensures safe, credible, and trusted client launches embracing regulatory expectations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Draft and distribute an internal advisory for client CxOs outlining new risks and best practices in agentic AI adoption, using data from Unit 42 and competitive insights from KPMG.</li>
  <li>Organize enablement sessions focused on Workday’s latest AI features, security posture, and integrated compliance tools.</li>
  <li>Analyze the Infosys-Anthropic partnership to inform Deloitte messaging and client guidance on responsible, interoperable agentic AI in Workday environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Risk:</strong> Rapid rollout of agentic AI increases exposure to cyber and privacy threats.<br/>
    <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Prioritize continuous threat assessments and transparent AI monitoring, embedding best practices and security drills in all client rollouts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Risk:</strong> Confusion from multi-vendor AI partnerships erodes client confidence in AI investments.<br/>
    <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use RFP templates and internal playbooks to position Deloitte’s value proposition in secure, governed integration for Workday AI projects.

The report finds that as more SaaS platforms like Workday adopt intelligent agents for HR and operations, the attack surface is expanding both in breadth and sophistication. This intensification is seen across sectors, with human error and insufficiently updated controls rated as top threats to cloud-based, agent-driven SaaS environments. For Workday and its clients, this signals a need for reinforced validation, continuous monitoring, and sharper access governance, especially as agentic AI automates broader operational tasks and cross-system integrations. \\n\\nStrategically, this report pushes for security-first enablement, ensuring any new agentic AI initiative is architected with layered defenses and transparent controls, addressing end-user trust and regulatory alignment. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, it highlights the increasing demand for advisory around AI risk assessments, threat modeling specific to HR tech, and workshops for resilient agent deployments—opportunities to embed security into every phase of digital transformation projects.\\n\\nClients expect GSIs like Deloitte to convene best practices in secure AI, drawing from both frameworks and practical SaaS context. The message is clear: as Workday and competitors accelerate agentic AI launches, responsible use hinges on demonstrable security outcomes, or adoption will stall among risk-sensitive enterprises.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202602170600PR_NEWS_USPRX____SF89219-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Infosys and Anthropic Announce Collaboration for Advanced AI Value Creation (2026-02-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On February 16, 2026, Infosys and Anthropic publicized a major collaboration aimed at co-developing advanced AI products and value streams for enterprise clients. This partnership seeks to operationalize safe, scalable, and context-rich AI agents—tools designed to improve workflow automation, knowledge management, and HR processes. Infosys positions itself as an orchestrator of AI adoption for large SaaS estates, citing Anthropic&#x27;s prowess in ethical generative models as a major trust vector for risk-conscious buyers.\\n\\nRelevance for the Workday ecosystem is profound: Infosys is a key Workday deployment and integration partner, so its pivot towards Anthropic’s agentic architectures may set new benchmarks for how AI augments Workday HCM, skills, and service platforms. Technically, expect new plug-in frameworks, like those piloted in Europe and APAC, driving performant automation while mitigating compliance headaches. From a Deloitte competitive lens, this highlights the need to showcase differentiated capabilities in responsible AI engineering, integration governance, and value realization, whilst actively monitoring partner and competitor narratives to guide client investment roadmaps. The announced partnership may trigger increased demand for multi-partner orchestrations within Workday practices and more holistic RFPs that specify ethical and interoperable agentic solutions.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202602162333PR_NEWS_USPRX____IO88844-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG in Canada launched the Agentic AI Engine in April 2025, which is seeing ongoing deployment by clients in 2026, focusing on automation of corporate functions (including HR) through responsible operational agents.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG&#x27;s continued scaling of agentic AI tools across HR and business operations directly challenges Workday’s ambitions in intelligent process automation.

As SaaS solutions like Workday integrate agentic AI across HR and operational use cases, the scope for potential attacks grows. The report stresses the role of human error and lax controls as leading vulnerabilities. For Workday, this means that robust security and transparency must anchor every phase of agentic deployment. Deloitte’s Workday practice should respond by expanding AI risk workshops, incorporating security threat modeling, and embedding best practices into every client delivery.
