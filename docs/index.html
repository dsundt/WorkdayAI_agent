<ul>
  <li><strong>No significant new Workday product or partnership developments in the last 48 hours</strong><br/>
    <p>Between 2025-10-18 and 2025-10-19, there have been no formally reported product launches, AI agent feature expansions, or major ecosystem moves by <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday</a> or its direct partners, based on all available vetted sources. The absence of new press releases, analyst commentary, or roadmap updates indicates a quiet window relative to the exceptionally active prior two weeks, which saw the announcement of the Agent Partner Network, new Illuminate AI capabilities, and the formalization of Microsoft/Workday AI agent collaboration.</p>
    <p>This lull provides Deloitte’s Workday practice and its clients with a moment to consolidate understanding of current offerings—particularly the scope and deployment pathways for Illuminate Agents, Skills Cloud integration, and new agent orchestration patterns within HCM and Finance. Given rivals (SAP, ADP, Dayforce) continue to layer generative and agentic tools atop core workflows, Deloitte teams should use this window to deeply align with Workday’s latest agent frameworks, identify pilots or prototype opportunities, and shape tailored advisory for clients evaluating AI agent adoption. Further, with no newly stated risks or responsible AI incidents, current due diligence should restage on recently published governance best practices while maintaining situational awareness for the next set of competitive or regulatory triggers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP SuccessFactors</strong>: Ongoing deployment and marketing of generative AI and agentic features, with client education and enablement resources focused on scenario-based HR automation and successor planning.<br/>
    <p>Although SAP did not launch new tools in the last 48 hours, its continued spotlight on AI-assisted HR workflows and public sharing of setup guidance for SuccessFactors clients signals a steady, iterative approach to onboarding agentic AI into global HRIS environments. SAP’s cadence of education and enablement may appeal to risk-averse clients who prioritize stability and transparency in their AI journey. For Deloitte, this energizes the need for readiness in helping clients contrast and select agentic frameworks across Workday and SAP, given typical multi-cloud or hybrid HR landscapes.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>ADP</strong>: Feature reiteration of Lyric platform and ADP Assist, emphasizing global compliance and human-centric AI for payroll and HR.<br/>
    <p>ADP maintains momentum by championing its AI capabilities in compliance and intuitive HR support via Lyric and Assist, though with no headline-grabbing launches in the past two days. Its narrative appeals to organizations facing complex, multinational payroll and regulatory challenges, presenting generative AI as a precision tool rather than a productivity panacea. For Deloitte’s clients considering next-gen payroll, this positions ADP as a credible alternative for organizations wary of pure-play agent automation, and Deloitte practitioners must deliver clear, ROI-driven comparisons to Workday’s emerging agent system groundwork.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deploying and customizing AI Agents with Workday Illuminate and Skills Cloud</strong><br/>
    Resource: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Cases and Examples from Workday Blog</a><br/>
    90-Day Outcome: Practitioners will be able to scope, implement, and optimize Workday AI agents for specific HR and finance processes, improving efficiency, compliance, and user experience across enterprise clients.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Comparative analysis of generative/agentic AI across major HCM platforms (Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, ADP, Dayforce)</strong><br/>
    Resource: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/how-companies-use-workday-ai-accelerate-upskilling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday AI in Upskilling</a><br/>
    90-Day Outcome: Deloitte consultants can provide nuanced, evidence-based recommendations and PoC pilots to clients navigating multi-vendor AI agent options, supporting smarter digital strategy and transformation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deep-dive review of recently launched Workday AI agent toolkits and orchestrations, prioritizing client-relevant use cases.</li>
  <li>Conduct cross-platform feature/roadmap gap analysis versus SAP, ADP, and Dayforce focusing on generative HR agent flows.</li>
  <li>Deliver client-facing enablement on Workday’s agent partner network, governance frameworks, and responsible AI practices.</li>
  <li>Monitor for new competitive launches or ecosystem moves as conference and earnings season continues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Market risk of features stalling or perception gap versus competitors due to lack of high-frequency AI launches.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Activate client education on depth, security, and roadmap strength of existing AI and agentic capabilities; leverage use cases and pilots to demonstrate impact.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Potential regulatory or ethical scrutiny as adoption of agentic AI scales in HR and finance.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Continually align narratives, deployments, and client advisory with Workday’s published responsible AI and governance frameworks, updating protocols as new standards evolve.
