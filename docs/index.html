<ul>
<li><b>No material Workday HCM, AI, or Agentic AI announcements detected in the last 24 hours.</b><br /><p>A review of principal sources covering Workday, its ecosystem, and competitive vendors (SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce), along with GSIs, system integrators, and relevant analyst/media outlets, reveals no notable product releases, strategic commentary, or analyst research within the 2025-10-28T07:37 to 2025-10-29T07:37 window. This lack of announcements can be interpreted in several ways: it may indicate a stabilization period before the next wave of product launches, offer clients a chance to digest and implement recent changes, or represent a calm in sector news flow.</p><p>For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this interval allows deeper engagement with existing Workday AI capabilities—such as agent-based workflows, skills cloud integrations, and the emerging AI marketplace—without the immediate pressure to refactor enablement or client roadmaps due to a product shift. It is also a prime window to review how competitors in the HR tech and ERP space are preparing for future AI rollouts, especially in agentic orchestration, HR workflows, and responsible AI governance, in order to position advisory and implementation offerings strategically. </p><p>Staying vigilant through daily monitoring remains critical, as competitor moves in agentic AI, regulatory developments, or high-profile deployments could surface at any time. Proactive client communication regarding the steady-state environment may help reinforce Deloitte’s position as a trusted, always-informed advisor.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Oracle, SAP, UKG:</b> No major new agentic AI product launches, AI HCM updates, or ecosystem integrations announced in last 24 hours. Existing recent announcements remain primary reference points.<br />
Implication: Competing platforms have not shifted their AI market posture since the last reporting period. Deloitte teams can focus on executing current value propositions and client migrations, ensuring technical enablement aligns with both recent and expected near-term product landscapes. Continued competitive monitoring is crucial to anticipate shifts—especially with the agentic AI race in HR SaaS and the potential for co-innovation partnerships or third-party accelerators.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Agentic AI workflow modeling</b> — <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4057700/workday-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-manage-agentic-ai-workers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a><br />
90-day outcome: Consultant teams have hands-on experience with current agentic AI configuration in Workday and ecosystem platforms; playbooks are refined for rapid adoption upon future releases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue daily horizon scanning focusing on Workday, SAP, Oracle, UKG, Dayforce, and prominent GSIs and hyperscalers for shifts in HCM agentic AI capabilities.</li>
<li>Revisit internal enablement materials on AI agent use cases and readiness for Workday AI Marketplace integrations.</li>
<li>Coordinate with account teams on proactive communications to current clients, leveraging the quiet news window for enablement workshops.</li>
<li>Prepare for potential end-of-quarter activity spikes or competitive reveals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Risk:</b> Complacency during periods of low news activity may lead to missed competitive or regulatory inflections.<br /><b>Mitigation:</b> Maintain minimum daily monitoring and periodic feedback loops with product/industry leads. Pre-position Deloitte for rapid response as soon as news breaks.</li>
