    <strong>Workday Named Best in KLAS for ERP for Large Organizations for Ninth Consecutive Year (2026-02-04):</strong>
    <p>Workday has secured its ninth consecutive KLAS Research award for Best ERP in the large enterprise segment. This recognition, rooted in detailed customer feedback and rigorous evaluation, signals robust satisfaction with Workday’s stability, innovation cadence, and overall delivery. At a time when enterprises are intensifying focus on reliability and autonomous capabilities in SaaS, Workday's achievement provides a notable differentiator. For Deloitte, this can be leveraged as proof of value in both pursuit and post-implementation assurance phases.<br>

    <strong>Agentic AI Risks and Accountability Emerge as Key Governance Focus (2026-02-04):</strong>
    <p>Recent coverage calls attention to the risks associated with enterprise-scale agentic AI—specifically, the operational and reputational consequences when autonomous agents act outside their intended bounds. With as many as 1.5 million agents noted as at-risk, the need for strong governance, monitoring, and accountability frameworks is urgent. For Workday clients, this heightens the importance of responsible AI principles in vendor selection and partnership. For Deloitte’s practice, supporting clients to implement and operationalize modern governance is a growing advisory imperative.<br>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Microsoft Raises the Bar in Agentic AI Performance Measurement</strong>
    <p>Microsoft’s fresh guidance on how organizations can measure agentic AI performance addresses enterprise concerns around benchmarking and risk. Their framework covers both business impact and risk reduction, making it an important resource for organizations navigating the new territory of scalable autonomous AI. The implication for Workday and partners like Deloitte is clear: rigorous, transparent performance evaluation will become table stakes for enterprise adoption. Integrators and advisors need to embed best-practice measurement into AI solution roll-outs.<br>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Responsible AI Governance</strong> (<a href="https://www.workday.com/en-be/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday AI Masterclass</a>):
    <p>Improve consulting and delivery capability for advising clients on risk, compliance, and operationalization of AI guardrails in SaaS environments. Enables credible guidance for regulatory alignment and ethical practice.</p>

    <strong>AI Agent Performance Measurement</strong> (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/it-professional/2026/02/04/ai-agent-performance-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Blog</a>):
    <p>Gives implementation teams real-world frameworks to support value realization and risk control discussions, helping position Workday-powered transformations as verifiably safe and effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate KLAS win messaging and value proof in all ongoing pursuits and client transformations.</li>
  <li>Host briefing sessions on agentic AI governance and accountability frameworks for both delivery and advisory teams.</li>
  <li>Update advisory playbooks with the latest on agentic AI risks and benchmarks, emphasizing Workday’s alignment with responsible AI practices.</li>
  <li>Accelerate internal enablement on responsible AI and measurable agentic performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Inadequate governance/monitoring of autonomous AI agents exposes clients to operational and reputational risks.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Make responsible AI and agent monitoring a foundational aspect of Deloitte-Workday delivery, using Workday’s AI governance toolkit.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Award recognition may create false comfort, leading clients to underinvest in oversight for agentic or autonomous operations.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Set clear expectations in all client interactions—awards validate capabilities, but operational discipline is still needed post go-live.</li>
</ul>

Competitors and partners continue to focus on AI agent performance and governance, sharpening the urgency for clients to align on trust and accountability in enterprise AI adoption.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Named Best in KLAS for ERP for Large Organizations for Ninth Consecutive Year (2026-02-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday achieved its ninth consecutive win as Best in KLAS for ERP, reaffirming its dominant position in the large enterprise ERP market. KLAS Research is widely regarded for its impartial, customer-driven analysis, and this continuous recognition signals strong customer satisfaction and robust solution delivery. The accolade arrives at a pivotal time as enterprises scrutinize SaaS platforms for reliability, security, and AI capability. Winning year after year demonstrates Workday’s ability to keep pace with evolving needs—particularly vital as organizations accelerate toward more autonomous operations and AI-infused HR processes.\\n\\nStrategically, this win strengthens Workday’s advantage in competitive pursuits against Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow. Technically, it signals continued investment in innovation and platform stability—critical for complex, global organizations. From a Deloitte perspective, this recognition provides a compelling proof point for current and prospective clients, supporting risk mitigation in transformation programs and helping justify executive buy-in for large-scale HCM and Finance implementations. Deloitte teams can leverage this as a trust and differentiation anchor in both pursuits and ongoing advisory engagements.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-04-Workday-Named-Best-in-KLAS-for-ERP-for-Large-Organizations-for-Ninth-Consecutive-Year\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Risks and Accountability Emerge as Key Governance Focus (2026-02-04)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Enterprise adoption of agentic (autonomous) AI is increasing, and this trend is accompanied by serious concerns around security, governance, and human oversight. New reporting highlights that as many as 1.5 million AI agents are at risk of &#x27;going rogue,&#x27; underscoring the growing importance of robust guardrails and clear accountability frameworks for SaaS and HR technology vendors. Governance gaps at deployment and during operations can expose organizations to persistent risks, including operational failures and regulatory non-compliance.\\n\\nFor Workday clients—and for Deloitte’s advisory and implementation practices—this signals an imperative to not only assess solution features, but also validate providers’ alignment with responsible AI best practices. Workday’s ongoing commitment to responsible AI, transparency, and bias mitigation aligns well with emerging enterprise requirements for explainability and resiliency. Deloitte can thus position frameworks for ongoing monitoring and risk assessment as a core value-add, guiding clients on operationalizing trust in agentic deployments and integrating with broader governance strategies.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4127774/1-5-million-ai-agents-are-at-risk-of-going-rogue-2.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft has published updated guidance on AI agent performance measurement, highlighting the challenges in evaluating autonomous agent effectiveness at scale. The update details best practices for benchmarking, assessing productivity, and minimizing operational risk in enterprise contexts.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;As clients weigh AI-driven automation from both platform providers and hyperscalers, solution differentiation will increasingly turn on demonstrable agent safety, reliability, and measurable business value—areas where transparency in measurement and reporting become selling points. For Workday and Deloitte, staying ahead in client education, benchmarking, and performance assurance for agentic workflows will be necessary to defend and grow adoption against rivals with strong analytics and platform reach.

For Deloitte, this can be leveraged as proof of value in both pursuit and post-implementation assurance phases.&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-02-04-Workday-Named-Best-in-KLAS-for-ERP-for-Large-Organizations-for-Ninth-Consecutive-Year\\\&quot;&gt;Read the KLAS announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\n    &lt;strong&gt;Agentic AI Risks and Accountability Emerge as Key Governance Focus (2026-02-04):&lt;/strong&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Recent coverage calls attention to the risks associated with enterprise-scale agentic AI—specifically, the operational and reputational consequences when autonomous agents act outside their intended bounds. With as many as 1.5 million agents noted as at-risk, the need for strong governance, monitoring, and accountability frameworks is urgent. For Workday clients, this heightens the importance of responsible AI principles in vendor selection and partnership. For Deloitte’s practice, supporting clients to implement and operationalize modern governance is a growing advisory imperative.&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/4127774/1-5-million-ai-agents-are-at-risk-of-going-rogue-2.html\\\&quot;&gt;Read the CIO overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\n    &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Raises the Bar in Agentic AI Performance Measurement&lt;/strong&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s fresh guidance on how organizations can measure agentic AI performance addresses enterprise concerns around benchmarking and risk. Their framework covers both business impact and risk reduction, making it an important resource for organizations navigating the new territory of scalable autonomous AI. The implication for Workday and partners like Deloitte is clear: rigorous, transparent performance evaluation will become table stakes for enterprise adoption. Integrators and advisors need to embed best-practice measurement into AI solution roll-outs.&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/it-professional/2026/02/04/ai-agent-performance-measurement\\\&quot;&gt;Read Microsoft&#x27;s guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Enablement&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\n    &lt;strong&gt;Responsible AI Governance&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-be/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html\\\&quot;&gt;Workday AI Masterclass&lt;/a&gt;):\\n    &lt;p&gt;Improve consulting and delivery capability for advising clients on risk, compliance, and operationalization of AI guardrails in SaaS environments.

Workday handles the official employment record, generates the offer letter, and manages payroll details. But onboarding isn’t just an HR task—it involves IT for laptop provisioning, Facilities for seating arrangements, and Learning &amp; Development for orientation sessions.\n\nThis is where ServiceNow HRSD shines. It orchestrates the entire onboarding journey, pulling in tasks from multiple departments, sending timely reminders, and keeping the new hire informed. All those moving parts are seamlessly coordinated in one workflow. [...] After they implemented ServiceNow HRSD:\n\n Employees were provided with a unified HR portal to address all their requirements.\n Routine inquiries were promptly resolved through knowledge articles.\n HR agents were able to concentrate on more complex cases rather than responding to a multitude of emails.\n Onboarding times saw significant improvement as workflows integrated across HR, IT, and Facilities.\n\nWhile the Workday remained the system of record, the overall employee experience underwent a remarkable transformation.\n\nThe Bottom Line [...] Related Content\n\n Adobe E-Signature with ServiceNow in HRSD forum\n ServiceNow Exchange: Process Mining for HR - Data-driven insights for AI agent deployment in HRSD events\n ServiceNow Exchange: HR Service Delivery Academy - Getting Started with Now Assist for HR in HRSD events\n Now You Know: Employee Workflows Newsletter (February 2026) in HRSD blog\n SERVIÇOS DE RH NO SERVICENOW - Guia prático para POs (sem tecnês) in HRSD forum&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ## Components\n\n​​Power Platform environment: Contains the Power Platform resources such as the agent built in Copilot Studio, and any supporting Power Apps that implement the human-in-the-loop user experience. Use solutions to move these resources from one environment to another, like development to test.\n\n​Copilot Studio agents: Use Copilot Studio to implement the agents in the solution. The primary agent, the Onboarding Agent, interacts with users directly or it can trigger autonomously. While multiple agents aren&#x27;t required for this scenario, you can use them to break the agent into more manageable components. For example, an Onboarding Learning agent could handle all the learning plan related tasks.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;There are also some areas of an AI-led SDLC that are not included in this post, things like reviewing the inner-loop process or the use of existing enterprise patterns and blueprints. I also did not review use of third-party plugins or tools available through GitHub. These would make for an interesting expansion of the demo. We also did not look at the creation of custom coding agents, which could be hosted in Microsoft Foundry; this is especially pertinent with the recent announcement of Anthropic models now being available to deploy in Foundry. [...] At the other end of the spectrum, what if the performance of AI tooling and agents outperforms our wildest expectations? Suddenly, AI tools and agents are picking up more and more of today’s complicated and advanced tasks. Will developers, architects, and organisations lose some ability to innovate? Fundamentally, we are not talking about artificial general intelligence when we say AI; we are talking about incredibly complex predictive models that can augment the existing ideas they are built upon but are not, in themselves, innovators. Put simply, in the words of Scott Hanselman: “Spicy auto-complete”. Does increased reliance on these agents in more and more of our business processes remove the opportunity for innovative ideas? For example, if agents were football managers, would we ever [...] ous agent in GitHub that can take a scoped development task and work on it in the background using the repository’s context. It can make code changes and produce concrete outputs like commits and pull requests for a developer to review. The developer stays in control by reviewing, requesting changes, or taking over at any point. This does the heavy lifting in our AI-led SDLC. We have already seen great success with customers who have adopted the coding agent when it comes to carrying out menial tasks to save developers time. These coding agents can work in parallel to human developers and with each other.\n\nIn our example we see that the coding agent creates a new branch for its changes, and creates a PR which it starts working on as it ticks off the various tasks generated in our spec.&quot;,

We still hear about a huge percentage of use cases that are very deterministic. People say, “I want to build a system that does this,” whether it’s supply chain, customer service management, or whatever.\n\nThe problem was that with early GenAI, building or deploying anything deterministic was really hard. With agents, we can now use GenAI to build nearly deterministic systems, and we can also get much smarter about accuracy.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Siliconangle\n\nSiliconangle\n\nUPDATED 12:00 EST / SEPTEMBER 16 2025\n\n AI\n\n### Workday acquires Sana Labs for $1.1B to upgrade agentic AI work experiences\n\nby Kyt Dotson\n\nHuman resources and finance software giant Workday Inc. today announced the acquisition of Sana Labs AB, an artificial intelligence company offering enterprise knowledge and employee training tools, for about $1.1 billion.\n\nWorkday also announced new AI agents for HR, finance and industry use cases in its Illuminate platform alongside a new developer platform, including a low-code agent builder that will allow customers to deploy custom AI agents. [...] ### Workday upgrades its AI agents and work tools\n\nIn addition to today’s acquisition news, Workday also announced new AI agents, including a Financial Close Agent and Case Agent, purpose-built for complex business processes like performance reviews, planning and assisting with financial use cases.\n\nThe new agents are part of Workday Illuminate, Workday’s AI platform. The company said the new agents are “purpose-built for work,” embedded with their respective industry use cases and powered by deep insights into business data and context. [...] For use cases not covered by these agents and Workday’s already existing AI agents, the company today announced Workday Build, a new developer platform that gives customers and partners the power to create and deploy their own AI-powered solutions. It includes Flowise Agent Builder, a low-code tool that makes building agents on the company’s platform simple for both non-technical and advanced users.\n\n“The era of one-size-fits-all enterprise software is over,” said Peter Bailis, chief technology officer at Workday. “With Workday Build, customers go from consuming AI to creating with it, giving them the power to build intelligent solutions directly on their most trusted people and financial data.”&quot;,

In settings where staffing, scheduling, and financial planning are tightly connected, the Agent System of Record enables agents to act on real-time data from across HR and finance systems, supporting key decisions like adjusting shift coverage based on patient volume, labor costs, or credentialing requirements.\n\nCredentialing is another space where agents are showing value. Instead of relying on spreadsheet tracking and periodic audits, health systems are deploying agents to monitor license renewals, training completions, and policy compliance in real time—reducing risk and administrative burden. [...] ## What’s Next: Putting Agentic AI into Action\n\nAgentic AI is becoming embedded into the operational and clinical systems that healthcare teams use every day. Across key healthcare AI applications like scheduling, documentation, credentialing, treatment planning, and research workflows, early deployments are showing where agentic AI can reduce friction and support faster and more informed decisions that drive outcomes.\n\nBut deployment is only part of the challenge. Real impact depends on how well AI-powered systems are governed, how clearly their purpose is defined, and how effectively they’re integrated into the environments they’re meant to support. That includes aligning with the realities of care delivery, data infrastructure, and oversight requirements. [...] In healthcare, even more so than other industries, agentic AI has an important dual impact: it helps to both optimize healthcare operations and efficiencies while powering scalable high-quality care provision. In clinical settings, agents help maintain continuity by adapting to real-time patient conditions, minimizing gaps in care, and aligning actions to treatment goals. On the operational side, they support dynamic resource allocation, reduce bottlenecks, and bring coordination into daily decision-making.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Top AI Agent Examples and Industry Use Cases | Workday&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Rather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work.\n\nHuman workers need access to transparent agent behavior, opportunities to intervene, and training to develop new digital fluency. Organizations, in turn, must invest in skills strategies that reflect the changing nature of work, not just the technologies driving it. [...] ## What’s Next for AI Agents?\n\nThe future of agentic AI is not a linear extension of what we see today. AI agents will introduce new frameworks for enterprise systems, workforce design, and decision-making models. The most important developments to watch include:\n\nMulti-agent ecosystems: AI agents will begin to operate collaboratively across domains and functions. Rather than work in isolation, agents will coordinate actions and handoffs—accelerating enterprise responsiveness while introducing new challenges for orchestration. [...] System and infrastructure realignment: Agentic workflows will require interoperability across systems of record, planning platforms, and workflow engines. Technical architectures will evolve to prioritize composability, observability, and shared context.\n\nWorkforce transformation as a design priority: Businesses will need to align skill development, team structures, and performance measurement with the new capabilities agents introduce. This means investing in human-AI collaboration readiness alongside technical deployment.\n\nThe role of agentic AI is expanding—and so is the scope of decisions that must be made around it. Leaders must be intentional when shaping that transformation to unlock long-term advantage.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Top 3 Use Cases for AI Agents in Finance\n\nAgentic systems are already supporting strategy across the finance lifecycle, stretching from period‑close automation to real‑time cash and spend oversight. Critically, AI agents work best with human oversight, collaborating on tasks and strategies in real time. These examples highlight how leading finance teams are applying AI-powered agents in production today.\n\n### 1. Internal Finance Workflow Optimization\n\nAgentic AI injects autonomous execution into processes once bogged down by manual handoffs and stale financial data. Fundamental workflows like procure-to-pay (P2P), record-to-report (R2R), and order-to-cash (O2C) are ideal candidates for agentic AI execution.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The future of investigations: Human-led, AI-enabled&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;February 03, 2026\n\n Investigative functions within organizations are getting squeezed by growing caseloads, data volumes, regulatory requirements, and cost pressures. Largely reliant on siloed, labor-intensive processes, many struggle to adapt and risk falling further behind.\n\n At the same time, trust remains a significant barrier to modernization. Many investigators worry that use of AI-enabled solutions―while proven in other domains―might jeopardize accuracy, compliance, privilege, explainability, and defensibility. Limited hands-on experience using AI compounds their concerns. [...] Failing to modernize, however, is no longer sustainable. Human-led, AI-enabled models help empower teams to deliver faster, more reliable, and transparent results. When implemented responsibly, AI not only improves accuracy and credibility but can transform the investigative function from a cost center into a strategic collaborator.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The best ERP software of 2026: Expert tested and reviewed&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Show less\n\nView now at Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 has the smoothest business technology ecosystem. It integrates well with Microsoft products like Office 365, Teams, and Power BI. This makes workflows feel natural for businesses already using Microsoft tools. You can choose specific applications -- like sales, finance, or customer service, instead of investing in the entire suite right away.\n\nMicrosoft&#x27;s Copilot AI makes a big difference in productivity. You can automate many routine tasks and gather smart insights based on available data. For example, I analyzed customer data from emails, social media, and phone calls to get lots of useful insights. I could even build complete customer profiles from the data it gleaned. [...] Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot AI makes a big difference in productivity. You can automate many routine tasks and gather smart insights based on available data. For example, I analyzed customer data from emails, social media, and phone calls to get lots of useful insights. I could even build complete customer profiles from the data it gleaned.\n\nHowever, implementing the system can be tough, especially for small to midsize businesses without dedicated IT support. Customization is powerful but can result in complex setups that need ongoing specialists to manage. Microsoft&#x27;s subscription model can also get expensive quickly as businesses add users and modules. Still, Dynamics 365 is a strong choice for those who need close Microsoft integration and the ability to expand their ERP powers over time. [...] Microsoft Dynamics 365 features: Microsoft ecosystem integration | Copilot AI assistance | Modular application suite | Power Platform connectivity | Real-time analytics | Workflow automation | Mobile accessibility\n\n Read More\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nView now at Odoo\n\nOdoo is refreshingly affordable compared with offerings from big ERP players. Its open-source foundation offers real cost savings while maintaining most key features. I was a big fan of the modular design. Businesses can begin with a basic CRM, then add inventory, manufacturing, or e-commerce as needed. A pay-as-you-scale model attracts startups that want enterprise-level features without high costs.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Rise of AI means companies could pass on SaaS&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“I think the notion that business applications exist, that’s probably where they will all collapse in the agent era, because if you think about it, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic. The business logic is all going to these agents. These agents are going to be multi-repo CRUD,” Nadella said on the Bg2 Pod referring to multi-repository create, read, update, delete databases. “They’re not going to discriminate between what the back end is. They’re going to update multiple databases and all the logic will be in the AI tier so to speak. Once the AI tier becomes the place where the logic is, then people will start replacing the backends.” [...] “I don’t subscribe to his point of view for this simple reason: there are about 20,000 legal jurisdictions worldwide and complying with applicable regulation is a major reason why people trust vendors like SAP,” he said. “At the very least, we are many years away from agentic systems being able to ingest regulations and comply with them in the systems they are going to generate on the fly.”\n\nBetz said AI is shaping customer behavior, but he sees it being used to support buying decisions, rather than a wholesale replacement of SaaS stacks. Besides, running a software stack is a lot of work.\n\n“Even if you are using an AI to maintain it, keeping software up to date is a chore and a cost,” he said. “The economics of SaaS may change, I don’t doubt that. But this idea it evaporates? Nah.” [...] “Just in January, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced a HIPAA-compliant life sciences health care tool that does directly compete against the Veevas of the world, and the Salesforce life sciences offerings,” Lawson said. “These are very specific examples of these AI first companies directly competing with SaaS and directly competing with both the platforms and vertical solutions, and point solutions.”\n\nThose moves by two of the largest foundation models echo the warning that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella issued a year ago, when he said AI agents posed a risk to SaaS companies. Over the last month, no software stock has lost more value than Microsoft: more than $450 billion in value as of close on Feb. 3.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality check: preparing for a silicon-based ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor - a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, an insurance company, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Biotech company Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] This strategic redesign is already taking shape across industries. At HPE, an enterprise software and services company, an AI agent called Alfred supports internal operational performance reviews. Toyota uses agentic tools to gain real-time visibility into vehicle arrivals at dealerships and is planning to empower agents to resolve supply chain issues - bypassing the need for human interaction with complex mainframe systems. These examples signal a shift away from traditional application modernization toward enabling agents to bridge legacy system gaps directly. [...] Several fundamental infrastructure challenges contribute to this gap. Traditional enterprise systems - often not designed for real-time, autonomous agent interactions - create significant bottlenecks, with Gartner forecasting that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027 due to legacy system incompatibility. In addition, data architectures built around batch-based Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes introduce friction for agent deployment. Many organizations also attempt to automate existing, human-centric processes instead of reimagining workflows for an agent-native environment, resulting in inefficient implementations and, in some cases, “workslop”- where poorly designed agentic applications actually increase operational burden.&quot;,

Autonomy without evidence invites regulatory action, customer defection, public backlash, or loss of stakeholder confidence. Trust without autonomy risks slowness and loss of competitive edge. And autonomy without human oversight invites loss of control. [...] ##### What digital leadership means\n\nDigital leadership is the capacity to turn digital capability into lasting value while taking responsibility for outcomes. It is not only about technology but about how people, processes, data and incentives are organised. It requires governance structures that enable safe experimentation, cultural practices that encourage transparency and accountability, and metrics that demonstrate trustworthiness over time.\n\nAn organisation&#x27;s culture is pivotal to achieving the right balance between autonomy and trust: the norms, rituals and incentives inside an organisation will determine whether autonomous systems scale responsibly or degrade to become an uncontrollable risk.&quot;,

Nonetheless, Workday (and HiredScore, prior to Workday’s acquisition of HiredScore) routinely conducts bias testing of its AI products that have the potential to significantly impact individuals’ economic opportunities. While Workday engaged an external consultant to conduct the bias testing of the Spotlight AI tool using the impact ratio approach as described in the NYC Law, the purpose of this testing is in furtherance of Workday/HiredScore’s commitments to identify and mitigate potential bias. Customers may need to conduct their own evaluation, testing and/or bias audits depending on their legal obligations. [...] HiredScore’s explainable AI outputs report to what extent a candidate’s application matches the job requirements using a simple A, B, C, D system, where A denotes the highest match between a candidate’s application and an employer-defined job requisition. Put another way, the technology acts like a “smart mirror” reflecting back the extent to which candidates fit the job requirements set by the employer. The A, B, C, D scores are never “curved.” This means that if a job requisition has commonly held requirements, there may be many more As and Bs than Cs and Ds. Conversely, if a job requisition has very uncommonly held requirements, there may be many more Cs and Ds than As and Bs, and each candidate will receive a score indicating how they align with the requirements; this score is [...] Designing and building responsible AI that our customers can trust and adopt in line with their legal compliance obligations has been part of HiredScore’s mission statement since the beginning. We take responsible AI very seriously and regularly work with outside experts in AI, data privacy, employment law, and responsible AI to ensure adherence to best practices and the highest standards.\n\n## Overview of HiredScore AI Functionality&quot;,

[...] With AI best practices and technical standards continuing to mature, the AI RMF is an essential benchmark for AI developers and deployers. Workday uses the AI RMF to assess and refine our responsible AI practices and to communicate the rigor of our AI governance approach to our enterprise customers. With leaders in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Singapore, and elsewhere taking action to promote trustworthy AI, the AI RMF is a common language to understand the expectations and requirements of AI governance.

By evaluating various aspects of AI development, implementation, and usage, this questionnaire helps Workday align third-party tools with our ethics principles and risk management priorities.\nWith AI legal requirements, best practices, and technical standards maturing, Workday will continue using the AI RMF as a reference point for how we assess, refine, and strengthen our approach to AI governance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Given that Workday’s 24 R2 release is scheduled for September 2024, it should just barely make its own timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle Cloud HCM made a clear announcement regarding its generative AI plans and use cases in June 2023. As of its first release in 2024, Oracle Cloud HCM customers have had access to embedded generative AI functionality that help customers improve decision making and enhance the employee experience. These include knowledgebase articles, job postings, performance feedback and development tips, and review summaries. It also includes many use cases that Workday has not announced on its roadmap, like a candidate experience summary, job category landing pages, and job match explanations. [...] Then co-CEO Carl Eschenbach first discussed preliminary plans for generative AI in March 2023. Workday’s generative AI use cases were clarified at Workday Rising in September 2023, talking about functionality such as job descriptions and employee growth plans. Plans for availability were set for 6-12 months from the event, or between March and September 2024. As of March 2024, Workday confirmed that there were three HCM use cases in an early adopter program as of its 24 R1 release, with none scheduled for general availability until the 24 R2 release or later. Workday subsequently put a fourth HCM use case into early adopter program during its DevCon 2024 event, with no clear plans for general availability. [...] Overall, Workday only has 25 generative AI use cases on its roadmap, while Oracle Fusion Applications have 50+ embedded use cases.\n\nThe innovation comparison is substantial. While Oracle Cloud HCM customers are benefiting from increased productivity, Workday users are made to wait.\n\n4. Deliver a personalized and meaningful experience to every employee&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] Transparency and trust: Ensure users know when they&#x27;re using a workload that uses AI capabilities. For example, responses should reference a specific knowledge source when possible. Agents should make clear when the user is interacting with an agent and when they&#x27;re receiving a response from a human.\n\nFeedback loops: Agents can easily accept feedback from the users on their interactions with the agent. Users can give a thumbs up or down by using the feedback control. Copilot Studio aggregates and presents this feedback for your review. Implement processes to review this feedback to identify bias or fairness issues.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop: Onboarding can often involve sensitive questions. Review onboarding solutions to ensure that adequate escalation to a human is implemented. [...] Test performance: Along with testing for functionality and failures, it&#x27;s important to test and develop a baseline for performance and evaluate it as part of your release cycle. Learn more in Design a testing strategy for your agents.\n\n## Responsible AI\n\nEnsure fair treatment: Ensure fair treatment across all candidates by actively addressing bias and maintaining equity in every interaction. Transparently disclose data sources with appropriate links, and enforce strict data privacy and security protocols.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Test performance: Along with testing for functionality and failures, it&#x27;s important to test and develop a baseline for performance and evaluate it as part of your release cycle. Learn more in Design a testing strategy for your agents.\n\n## Responsible AI\n\nEnsure fair treatment: Ensure fair treatment across all candidates by actively addressing bias and maintaining equity in every interaction. Transparently disclose data sources with appropriate links, and enforce strict data privacy and security protocols. [...] ## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip&quot;,

Drawing from recent case studies, implementation of AI and analytics enables banks to integrate AI-powered tools seamlessly into their advisory processes, thereby enhancing the overall, measurable client experience by up to 40%.3 [...] Through regular and clear mobile communication, AI can be leveraged to explain in simple everyday language why a client’s investments have changed since the day before - helping clients understand market movements without the usual jargon, and making the whole experience feel more transparent, personalised and engaging.  \n      \n    Experience in digital innovation and user experience design shows that banks can integrate advanced self-service mobile tools that encourage customers to provide the required, underlying information themselves. On top, combining this additional information with AI, for example, in periodic KYC reviews, has the potential to reduce investigation times by 20-30%.3 [...] 4. Client expectations are evolving, with strong demand for personalised services, transparency and proactive communication. Clients seek real-time insights and customised recommendations and expect firms to leverage advanced technologies to help them achieve their financial goals. Deloitte Switzerland’s Customer Experience Maturity Study 2025 finds that 46% of clients desire personalised financial reporting, while 44% seek virtual investment solutions1 and 34% want one-click portfolio diversification2. AI plays a crucial role in meeting these expectations by delivering data-driven advice and fostering continuous client engagement through personalised investment recommendations, including investment rebalancing based on milestones and market conditions.&quot;,

But it also pays to be open to less structured moments, too. “Leave yourself a little free time here and there to explore things like ‘Ask an Expert’ or get coffee with a Workday rep,” Barattin said. “Opportunities like that can be fruitful for somebody who’s coming to Workday Rising for the first time.”\n\n“I’m looking forward to learning more about what the role and impact AI and ML will have in Workday’s product roadmaps.”\n\n## Every Workday Rising Is Different\n\nBarattin said Healthfirst sent a group of employees to Workday Rising soon after going live with Workday.

That helps us to plan better for the future and understand what kind of additional functionality is going to be coming that could be beneficial for us,” adding that his team is better able to evaluate what work might need to be done ahead of implementation.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All of us at Workday believe in responsible AI, understanding that in order to maximize the potential of AI and ML, they must be trustworthy and augment humans, not displace them. This is why it’s so important to gather at events like Workday Rising, where we’ll spend four days together discussing how we navigate through the uncertainty and maintain the art and science of our businesses, while sharing ideas and key learnings. Workday has more than 65 million users under contract on our platform, and this continuous growth benefits us all. Workday customers are part of a vibrant community that innovates, problem solves, and collaborates to write the playbook for how the future works. [...] As chief marketing officer at Workday, it’s my mission to care for our customers through the challenges they face, as we all learn to navigate this new world of work. Within my own discipline, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been disruptive and, at the same time, have given us incredible insights, significant productivity gains, and unique challenges as we embrace their power and reach. I’ve also learned that data alone can’t substitute the human touch, as we build relationships and personalized messages with a blend of art, science, creativity, and data. [...] At Workday Rising, our Innovation Keynote is centered around this very topic, and we’re excited to share demos that provide a sneak peek into what the future looks like with generative AI and the impact our innovation has on the daily work of our customer and partner community.\n\nWhether you’re joining us virtually or in person, we’ve assembled our top executives, over 600 speakers, and more than 400 sessions to fuel your exploration and learning, along with 150 partners and exhibitors to help problem-solve and navigate next steps. We’ve also invited some inspirational and innovative influencers to share their perspectives: James Cameron, Academy Award-winning filmmaker, explorer, and CEO of Lightstorm Entertainment; Adena Friedman, Nasdaq Chair and CEO; and Sunny Bedi, CIO at Snowflake.&quot;,

The second-highest increase, B2B and professional, rose just 62 percent.&quot;,

It saved the most time - 26 minutes daily - when searching for existing information, followed by summarizing information, writing emails, and producing written material. It saved the least time (9 minutes daily) transcribing or summarizing meetings.\n\nCopilot users primarily redirected time saved toward completing other tasks, improving work quality, and planning.&quot;,

This year, the company thinks that figure for Q2 will be $6 billion.\n\nWhile AI is messing up Qualcomm’s smartphone business, the company is also trying to cash in on the brainbox boom with its own inferencing silicon. Amon said Qualcomm has started shipping product to its sole confirmed customer – Humane – and is helping the outfit to run third-party workloads. [...] “You would imagine that a company at our size will be engaged in conversations with some of the largest hyperscalers and cloud service providers in the industry,” Amon said, adding “We&#x27;re getting good traction.” Revenue from the AI silicon will arrive next year.\n\nAmon said Qualcomm also has bright prospects in robots, cars, and patent licensing deals. The CEO hopes all will help Qualcomm diversify and grow revenue in time to hit a 2029 target for the company to be less reliant on smartphones.\n\nIn the present, Qualcomm remains reliant on smartphone revenue and investors decided these results mean its shares should sell for around $134 apiece, well down from the $150-plus they were willing to pay earlier in the day. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Transparency and trust: Ensure users know when they&#x27;re using a workload that uses AI capabilities. For example, responses should reference a specific knowledge source when possible. Agents should make clear when the user is interacting with an agent and when they&#x27;re receiving a response from a human.\n\nFeedback loops: Agents can easily accept feedback from the users on their interactions with the agent. Users can give a thumbs up or down by using the feedback control. Copilot Studio aggregates and presents this feedback for your review. Implement processes to review this feedback to identify bias or fairness issues.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop: Onboarding can often involve sensitive questions. Review onboarding solutions to ensure that adequate escalation to a human is implemented. [...] ## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;to gauge client emotions and make proactive adjustments, ensuring advice remains timely and aligned with client needs. Drawing from recent case studies, implementation of AI and analytics enables banks to integrate AI-powered tools seamlessly into their advisory processes, thereby enhancing the overall, measurable client experience by up to 40%.3 [...] Through regular and clear mobile communication, AI can be leveraged to explain in simple everyday language why a client’s investments have changed since the day before - helping clients understand market movements without the usual jargon, and making the whole experience feel more transparent, personalised and engaging.  \n      \n    Experience in digital innovation and user experience design shows that banks can integrate advanced self-service mobile tools that encourage customers to provide the required, underlying information themselves. On top, combining this additional information with AI, for example, in periodic KYC reviews, has the potential to reduce investigation times by 20-30%.3 [...] 4. Client expectations are evolving, with strong demand for personalised services, transparency and proactive communication. Clients seek real-time insights and customised recommendations and expect firms to leverage advanced technologies to help them achieve their financial goals. Deloitte Switzerland’s Customer Experience Maturity Study 2025 finds that 46% of clients desire personalised financial reporting, while 44% seek virtual investment solutions1 and 34% want one-click portfolio diversification2. AI plays a crucial role in meeting these expectations by delivering data-driven advice and fostering continuous client engagement through personalised investment recommendations, including investment rebalancing based on milestones and market conditions.&quot;,

Autonomy without evidence invites regulatory action, customer defection, public backlash, or loss of stakeholder confidence. Trust without autonomy risks slowness and loss of competitive edge. And autonomy without human oversight invites loss of control. [...] ##### What digital leadership means\n\nDigital leadership is the capacity to turn digital capability into lasting value while taking responsibility for outcomes. It is not only about technology but about how people, processes, data and incentives are organised. It requires governance structures that enable safe experimentation, cultural practices that encourage transparency and accountability, and metrics that demonstrate trustworthiness over time.\n\nAn organisation&#x27;s culture is pivotal to achieving the right balance between autonomy and trust: the norms, rituals and incentives inside an organisation will determine whether autonomous systems scale responsibly or degrade to become an uncontrollable risk.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Through regular and clear mobile communication, AI can be leveraged to explain in simple everyday language why a client’s investments have changed since the day before - helping clients understand market movements without the usual jargon, and making the whole experience feel more transparent, personalised and engaging.  \n      \n    Experience in digital innovation and user experience design shows that banks can integrate advanced self-service mobile tools that encourage customers to provide the required, underlying information themselves. On top, combining this additional information with AI, for example, in periodic KYC reviews, has the potential to reduce investigation times by 20-30%.3 [...] to gauge client emotions and make proactive adjustments, ensuring advice remains timely and aligned with client needs. Drawing from recent case studies, implementation of AI and analytics enables banks to integrate AI-powered tools seamlessly into their advisory processes, thereby enhancing the overall, measurable client experience by up to 40%.3 [...] 3.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality check: preparing for a silicon-based ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Effective implementations also rely on specialized agents orchestrated at scale, automating entire workflows through emerging standards such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). Together, these approaches enable a “microservices model for AI,” reducing complexity while supporting scalable orchestration and platform flexibility. At the same time, organizations are introducing FinOps frameworks for AI, essential for monitoring and controlling agent-driven costs, particularly in token-based pricing environments. [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor - a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, an insurance company, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Biotech company Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Workday Illuminate는 Workday가 진행 중인 AI 로드맵이 진일보한 결과이며, 현실의 다양한 시나리오에서 그 가치를 발휘할 것입니다.\n\nBhusri는 AI가 매니저 경험을 혁신하는, 즉, 매니저가 팀에서 최고의 인재를 빠르게 발견하고 성장시키도록 지원하는 HR 환경에 관해 설명했습니다.\n\n그는 청중에게 모든 비즈니스 트랜잭션의 생성, 검증, 회계 처리가 사실상 비대면으로 이루어지고 계정이 셀프 조정되는 환경을 상상해 보라고 말했습니다.\n\n또한 Workday의 지난 화요일 발표에 의하면, Workday는 대표적인 AI 기반 문서 인텔리전스 플랫폼, Evisort를 인수하기 위한 최종 계약을 체결했습니다. Workday는 Evisort를 통해 HR 및 재무 제품군의 전 범위에서 AI 기반 문서 인텔리전스 솔루션을 추가할 계획입니다.\n\n## Workday Illuminate 탐구\n\nAI가 계속해서 기술 업계의 최대 관심사로 자리잡은 가운데, 진실과 과장을 구분하기가 쉽지 않습니다. AI/머신러닝 부문 VP, Shane Luke는 Workday가 진정한 가치 제공에 집중한다고 거듭 강조했습니다.\n\n그는 AI가 사용하는 거대 언어 모델(LLM)을 간단히 설명하면서 범용 LLM은 웹 전체의 광범위한 정보로 학습하기 때문에 기업의 니즈를 제대로 해결하지 못한다고 지적했습니다. [...] 이 에이전트는 직무 설명 작성, 후보자 소싱, 인터뷰 스케줄링 등의 태스크를 간단히 해결하는 것은 물론 후보자 프로필에 관한 AI 기반의 인사이트를 제공합니다. Microsoft Teams와 같은 커뮤니케이션 플랫폼과도 통합됩니다.\n\nWorkday의 새로운 글로벌 인재 동향 및 채용 트렌드 리포트에 의하면, AI 기반의 채용 어시스턴트 기능은 적합한 인재 발견이 점점 더 힘들어질 때 특히 진가를 발휘합니다.\n\n새로운 Expenses 에이전트는 AI를 활용하여 경비보고서를 자동으로 생성하고 제출합니다. 이를테면 출장 중인 직원이 조식 결제를 완료하는 즉시 영수증을 업로드하라는 문자 메시지를 받습니다. 그러면 시스템에서 영수증을 신용카드 거래와 매칭하여 자동으로 경비 라인을 생성합니다.\n\nSuccession 에이전트는 조직 차원에서 미래의 리더를 찾고 성장시키도록 돕습니다. 매니저가 승계 계획을 업데이트하도록 미리 알려주고, 조직의 전 범위에서 승계자를 자동으로 추천하고, 핵심 인재를 위한 맞춤형 개발 계획을 만들어 다음에 맡을 역할을 준비할 수 있게 합니다.\n\n마지막으로 Optimize 에이전트는 Workday의 비즈니스 프로세스를 능률화합니다. 병목 지점, 비효율성, 모범 사례와의 차이점을 밝혀냅니다. 이를테면 온보딩 프로세스의 문제점(예: 수동 데이터 입력, 순서가 맞지 않는 단계)에 자동으로 플래그를 지정하고 해결할 수 있습니다. [...] Workday 소식 및 문화\n\n# Workday Rising: 차세대 Workday AI, Workday Illuminate 소개\n\n혁신 기조연설에서 Workday의 리더들은 Workday Illuminate(워크데이 일루미네이트)가 어떻게 수동 태스크의 속도를 향상하고, 실시간 어시스턴트를 제공하며, 비즈니스 프로세스의 전 범위를 혁신하는지 소개했습니다.\n\nMary Hayes Weier\n\nWorkday Rising에서 가장 큰 기대를 모으는 순간은 Workday의 최신 솔루션을 공개하는 혁신 기조연설입니다. 공동 창업자이자 이사회 의장인 Aneel Bhusri는 화요일의 기조연설에서 Workday의 핵심 가치인 혁신의 중요성을 강조했습니다.\n\n\&quot;Workday는 고객을 위한 중단 없는 혁신에 집중합니다.\&quot;라고 Bhusri는 말했습니다.\n\n이러한 혁신의 중심이 될 Workday의 차세대 AI, Workday Illuminate가 발표되었습니다. 현재 정식 출시된 Workday Illuminate에는 수동 태스크의 속도를 향상하고 실시간 AI 어시스턴트를 제공하고 AI 오케스트레이션을 통해 비즈니스 프로세스의 전 범위를 혁신하는 기능이 포함되어 있습니다.\n\nBhusri는 기술 업계가 AI를 둘러싼 장밋빛 전망의 정점을 지나고 있으며 &#x27;AI가 실질적인 비즈니스 가치를 제공하는 것이 관건&#x27;임을 인정했습니다. Workday는 10여 년 전부터 AI에 투자하면서 생성형 AI 기능, Workday Extend 내 AI Gateway, Workday AI 마켓플레이스 등을 내놓았습니다.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Global CHRO AI Indicator Report\n\nIn the past decade HR has undergone a major evoluton from a supportive role to a strategic one. However, as this report finds, HR teams are more conservative on AI than finance and IT.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;to gauge client emotions and make proactive adjustments, ensuring advice remains timely and aligned with client needs. Drawing from recent case studies, implementation of AI and analytics enables banks to integrate AI-powered tools seamlessly into their advisory processes, thereby enhancing the overall, measurable client experience by up to 40%.3 [...] Through regular and clear mobile communication, AI can be leveraged to explain in simple everyday language why a client’s investments have changed since the day before - helping clients understand market movements without the usual jargon, and making the whole experience feel more transparent, personalised and engaging.  \n      \n    Experience in digital innovation and user experience design shows that banks can integrate advanced self-service mobile tools that encourage customers to provide the required, underlying information themselves. On top, combining this additional information with AI, for example, in periodic KYC reviews, has the potential to reduce investigation times by 20-30%.3 [...] 4. Client expectations are evolving, with strong demand for personalised services, transparency and proactive communication. Clients seek real-time insights and customised recommendations and expect firms to leverage advanced technologies to help them achieve their financial goals. Deloitte Switzerland’s Customer Experience Maturity Study 2025 finds that 46% of clients desire personalised financial reporting, while 44% seek virtual investment solutions1 and 34% want one-click portfolio diversification2. AI plays a crucial role in meeting these expectations by delivering data-driven advice and fostering continuous client engagement through personalised investment recommendations, including investment rebalancing based on milestones and market conditions.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

But more than half also said they expect to hire “more AI-savvy HR leaders” in the next two years to ensure the transition takes place.\n\n“This dynamic will shape leadership decisions for years to come and runs throughout the survey’s findings,” the release said.\n\nDemands for skilled talent have not abated, even as the market has swung more favorably toward employers. To navigate this pressure, more recruiters have turned to automated tools and AI use, according to LinkedIn, particularly for evaluation and sourcing as more professionals join the market.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;​Improve the new hire experience with a smart onboarding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Workflow\n\nCandidate data retrieval: The agent uses a connection to the HR system that manages candidate information to retrieve the candidate info (role, department, team, contact information) and starts the onboarding process. You can enable multiple methods to start the onboarding process. The agent could trigger an event from the HR system indicating a new hire. For example, the Workday HCM connector supports a When an Employee is Added or Updated trigger. The new employee can also interact with the agent to start the process by providing the appropriate information. [...] ## In this article\n\nUse Copilot Studio and Power Platform to create an AI-driven onboarding agent that automates the onboarding process by integrating multiple systems, creating custom learning recommendations, and answering candidate questions. Manual and fragmented onboarding processes lead to inefficiencies, delays, and inconsistent new-hire experiences. By using the custom agent approach, you can integrate multiple sources to provide a seamless experience for new hires and HR teams.\n\nTip [...] ### Knowledge sources\n\nTo properly respond to the new employee&#x27;s questions, the agent requires several knowledge sources.\n\nCandidate information: Information from the HR system about the candidate. The agent gets this information by using a connection to Human Resources Information System (HRIS) systems like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, and other similar HR systems.\n\nNew hire Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Common new hire questions and answers.\n\nTraining guidance: Training documents outline requirements for training new employees. These documents typically combine training on company policies with role-specific training based on the employee&#x27;s position. The agent uses this knowledge to create custom learning plans based on the employee&#x27;s role, team, and required skills.&quot;,

Drawing from recent case studies, implementation of AI and analytics enables banks to integrate AI-powered tools seamlessly into their advisory processes, thereby enhancing the overall, measurable client experience by up to 40%.3 [...] Through regular and clear mobile communication, AI can be leveraged to explain in simple everyday language why a client’s investments have changed since the day before - helping clients understand market movements without the usual jargon, and making the whole experience feel more transparent, personalised and engaging.  \n      \n    Experience in digital innovation and user experience design shows that banks can integrate advanced self-service mobile tools that encourage customers to provide the required, underlying information themselves. On top, combining this additional information with AI, for example, in periodic KYC reviews, has the potential to reduce investigation times by 20-30%.3 [...] 4. Client expectations are evolving, with strong demand for personalised services, transparency and proactive communication. Clients seek real-time insights and customised recommendations and expect firms to leverage advanced technologies to help them achieve their financial goals. Deloitte Switzerland’s Customer Experience Maturity Study 2025 finds that 46% of clients desire personalised financial reporting, while 44% seek virtual investment solutions1 and 34% want one-click portfolio diversification2. AI plays a crucial role in meeting these expectations by delivering data-driven advice and fostering continuous client engagement through personalised investment recommendations, including investment rebalancing based on milestones and market conditions.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### From our editors straight to your inbox\n\nClint Boulton\n\nClint Boulton is a tech storyteller with a keen interest in illuminating the issues IT leaders grapple with daily. For global-leading brands such as Wall Street Journal, Foundry, Salesforce and Dell, Clint has created compelling content regaling readers with tales about how IT leaders and their teams juggle the application of people, process and technology to solve business challenges. And always with a critical eye on how these IT teams augment productivity and generate revenues.\n\n## More from this author\n\n### Your agentic AI strategy’s missing link: Human resources\n\n### Agentic AI in 2026: More mixed than mainstream\n\n### What is RPA? A revolution in business process automation\n\n## Show me more [...] ## Preparing for the AI tidal wave\n\nThese best practices, designed to protect core and ancillary business operations against systemic outages, cybersecurity attacks, and other risks, are all critical arrows in the IT resiliency quiver. Collectively, these approaches will take on greater importance as organizations grow their consumption of AI workloads.\n\nWhile most organizations are not yet launching agentic AI en masse, the technology will exponentially increase business risks when it mainstreams. After all, while agentic systems may scale productivity, they can also wreck “your entire organization at scale,” says Dickson, citing last year’s incident of how an agentic coding tool deleted a whole database. [...] A database error knocked out digital services at Starbucks, McDonald’s, and many more big brands last November. A cybersecurity update grounded flights, canceled surgeries, and thousands of other services in 2024.\n\nToday IT-related disasters get their own year-in-review recaps. Tomorrow the growing prevalence of agentic AI systems will compound complexity and court greater risk.\n\nA collection of public and private clouds, edge networks, so-called AI factories filled with GPUs and specialized hardware support these emerging workloads — each a link in a complex web that can put business resiliency at risk when any component goes down.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The hard yards of enterprise AI: What it really takes to make ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprise AI requires a leap of faith.\n\nDuring the last year, the AI conversation has shifted. The agentic AI metaphor was that it’s just like hiring 100 new interns, the only limiting factor being your own imagination. Now that we’ve experienced digital labor in the workplace, it turns out that some of these interns aren’t well placed to tackle narrow jobs, aren’t totally reliable, and can be frustratingly inconsistent.\n\nYet we’ve also seen the promise and examples where AI can be just as mind-blowing as consumer AI.\n\nThere’s so much focus on creating bigger and better LLMs, but I wonder whether we’re waiting for small LMs to work alongside LLMs and bring that company-specific intelligence? [...] So, we looked closely at our customer contact drivers and asked a straightforward question: Which of these genuinely need hands-on, urgent, and human support, and which don’t? That analysis led us to a clear north star: Around 50% of customer needs could be met agentically and, of those, 60% shouldn’t need a human in the loop. Conversely, this created the opportunity to focus reps on those cases that require empathy, contextual awareness, and hands-on support.  \n  \nOur goal wasn’t to replace people, but to elevate human support and free up time for the conversations where our staff can shine.\n\n## 3.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What Is Agentic AI in Banking?\n\nAgentic AI in banking refers to AI systems composed of multiple autonomous agents that can independently analyze information, make decisions, and execute actions across workflows within defined guardrails and human oversight.\n\nUnlike traditional AI models or copilots that provide recommendations, agentic AI systems can orchestrate end-to-end processes. This makes them well suited to banking operations, which involve multiple handoffs, probabilistic decision-making, regulatory constraints, and risk thresholds.\n\nWhy Banking Processes Are Strong Candidates for Agentic AI [...] The critical question is no longer whether banks are investing in AI, but how they can monetize that investment to generate measurable ROI and what role agentic AI plays in that equation.\n\nAgentic AI offers banks a path from AI experimentation to measurable returns. By deploying autonomous AI agents across complex, multi-stage banking processes such as credit decisioning, risk management, and compliance, banks can accelerate decisions, improve consistency, and scale automation while maintaining governance. The greatest ROI comes from disciplined use case selection, AI-ready data and infrastructure, and strong trust and governance frameworks.\n\nWhat Is Agentic AI in Banking?

I’ve spent years in executive conversations about AI — strategy, architecture, transformation — yet not once has anyone raised the topic of AI disaster recovery. Not a single time.\n\nWe are sprinting toward what I call agentic amnesia, a state where enterprises become so dependent on AI that its failure erases the organizational intelligence needed to recover.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Preparing for the AI tidal wave\n\nThese best practices, designed to protect core and ancillary business operations against systemic outages, cybersecurity attacks, and other risks, are all critical arrows in the IT resiliency quiver. Collectively, these approaches will take on greater importance as organizations grow their consumption of AI workloads.\n\nWhile most organizations are not yet launching agentic AI en masse, the technology will exponentially increase business risks when it mainstreams. After all, while agentic systems may scale productivity, they can also wreck “your entire organization at scale,” says Dickson, citing last year’s incident of how an agentic coding tool deleted a whole database.

Tomorrow the growing prevalence of agentic AI systems will compound complexity and court greater risk.\n\nA collection of public and private clouds, edge networks, so-called AI factories filled with GPUs and specialized hardware support these emerging workloads — each a link in a complex web that can put business resiliency at risk when any component goes down.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;1.5 million AI agents are at risk of going rogue - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Perspective, he said, also needs to change: “AI agents are no longer helpful bots. They often operate with delegated yet broad credentials, persistent access, and undefined accountability. This can become a costly mistake as overprivileged agents are the new insider threat. We need to define tiered access for AI agents. While we can’t avoid giving a few people keys to our house to speed up things, if you trust every stranger with your house keys, we wouldn’t be able to blame the locksmith when things go missing.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on CSOonline.\n\n## Related content\n\n### When the AI goes dark: Building enterprise resilience for the age of agentic AI\n\n### CIOs must rethink resiliency for an increasingly complex IT world [...] ## About\n\n## Policies\n\n## Our Network\n\n## More\n\n## Africa\n\n## Americas\n\n## Asia\n\n## Europe\n\n## Oceania\n\n## Topics\n\n## About\n\n## Policies\n\n## Our Network\n\n## More\n\n# 1.5 million AI agents are at risk of going rogue\n\n## A survey of large firms in the US and UK finds that more than half of the deployed agents are not actively monitored or secured.\n\nAgentic AI\n\nA study released Wednesday by API management platform vendor Gravitee indicates that upwards of half of the three million agents currently in use by organizations in the US and UK “are ungoverned and at the risk of going rogue.” [...] Even today, he noted, “we see that most enterprise AI agents are running without oversight. Many organizations don’t even know how many agents they have, where they’re running, or what they can touch. If you don’t know how many mules are in the barn, don’t act surprised when one kicks the door down.”\n\nJain pointed out that AI agents are no different. “Unaccounted agents often emerge through sanctioned, low-code tools and informal experimentation, bypassing traditional IT scrutiny until something breaks. You cannot govern what you can’t see. So, we need to understand that the real issue isn’t ‘rogue AI’, it’s invisible AI.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We often fear that AI will hallucinate because it’s too creative. The real danger is that it will fail because it’s blind. And you cannot automate a complex business with fragmented visibility.

Acting on that creates costly operational pitfalls that go far beyond failed AI pilots alone.\n\n## Why agentic AI requires a platform-native architecture\n\nThis is why the conversation is shifting from \&quot;which model should we use?\&quot; to \&quot;where does our data live?\&quot;\n\nTo support a hybrid workforce where human experts work alongside duly capable AI agents, the underlying data can’t be stitched together; it must be native to the core business platform. A platform-native approach, specifically one built on a common data model (e.g. Salesforce), eliminates the translation layer and provides the single source of truth that good, reliable AI requires.

CIOs and technical leaders are asking why their pilot programs, even those designed to automate the simplest of workflows, aren’t delivering the magic promised in demos.\n\nWhen AI fails to answer a basic question or complete an action correctly, the instinct is to blame the model. We assume the LLM isn’t \&quot;smart\&quot; enough. But that blame is misplaced. AI doesn’t struggle because it lacks intelligence. It struggles because it lacks context.&quot;,

While legacy ERP is a transactional system of record, Workday is a system of action that understands the business, anticipates needs, and helps healthcare leaders reimagine how work gets done. By unifying HR, finance, and supply chain management into a single platform with AI at its core, Workday helps eliminate fragmented processes and provide real-time visibility. This enables healthcare organizations of all sizes to unlock operational efficiencies and reclaim the time spent on administrative hurdles, helping to shift the focus back to patient-centered care.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;When the AI goes dark: Building enterprise resilience for ... - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In most companies, workforce readiness for AI, particularly for the event of AI failure, appears to be an afterthought at best. This is a fatal blind spot. Unlike a database outage, where employees can revert to manual processes they remember, AI agents perform work that humans may no longer know how, or perform at the necessary scale. If your AI-powered customer service goes down, can your team step in? Do they understand the workflows well enough to execute them? Have they been cross-trained to bridge the gap?\n\nBusiness continuity planning must ensure that staff understand AI pipelines and data flows, that teams are cross-trained to prevent reliance on a handful of specialists, and that substitution plans exist for when AI systems falter. [...] ServiceNow’s 2025 Enterprise AI Maturity Index found that average maturity scores dropped 9 points year-over-year, with fewer than 1% of organizations scoring above 50 on a 100-point scale. The finding suggests AI innovation is outpacing organizations’ capacity to deploy it safely at scale.\n\nWe are moving toward a world where businesses cannot function without their digital workforce. When AI agents handle customer interactions, manage supply chains, execute financial processes and coordinate operations, a sustained AI outage isn’t an inconvenience. It’s an existential threat.\n\n## The overlooked resilience layer [...] Consider what’s actually at stake. Embeddings are how an AI system encodes and retrieves knowledge. Think of it as an employee’s mental map of where information lives across the organization. Fine-tuned model weights represent customizations that shape how the AI reasons about your specific business context, much like institutional knowledge built over time. Agent workflows are multistep processes that AI executes autonomously, like a trained team running a complex playbook without supervision.\n\nLose this state, and you haven’t just lost data. You’ve lost the organizational intelligence that took hundreds of human days of annotation, iteration and refinement to create. You can’t simply re-enter it from memory.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How enterprises are preparing for agentic AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;GenAI felt easy at the beginning, so people expect it to always be easy. But building great AI systems is hard. You’re going to have failures. Success is about continuous improvement, not getting it right the first time.\n\nI gave a talk a couple years ago where a global financial services firm talked about an agent they built to help call center employees onboard faster. I asked how they measured success. The response was, “That wasn’t the point. The point was to get my team experience building.”\n\nThat mindset stuck with me. Companies that show up with that attitude are the ones that are going to win.\n\nCatherine: The growth mindset.\n\nCraig: Exactly.\n\n## Closing thought [...] Craig: For decades, we’ve focused on managing structured data and making sure the right people have access and the wrong people don’t. Now we have to think about that for unstructured data too, and we have to think about agents as new entities. How do I make sure these agents have access to the right data at the right time? [...] You also have to think about the user on the other end of the agent. A classic example is building a chatbot on top of Jira. Often Jira or other similar systems can contain confidential information. If it’s not governed, anyone could surface that information. So it’s not just about what the agent can access. It’s also about what the agent can return based on who’s asking. The building blocks exist, but governance has to be treated as a first-class problem, not an afterthought.\n\n### A simple way to think about identity, access, and agents\n\nCatherine: This sounds a lot like identity and access management. How should leaders think about that as they prepare?\n\nCraig: Fundamentally, it is identity and access management, but with a new class of identity: agents.&quot;,

A revolution in business process automation\n\n## Show me more [...] Whether IT leaders are protecting agentic systems, or physical or virtual supply chains, there is no 100% solution. For all the talk of preparing people, technology, and processes, organizations are still at the mercy of their providers, their tools, and good old-fashioned human error.\n\n“It’s not about perfect; it’s about good,” Dickson says. “How do we reduce the complexity, increase the redundancy, and how do we make these systems better?”\n\n## Related content\n\n### 1.5 million AI agents are at risk of going rogue\n\n### Turning M&amp;A risk into IT reward\n\n### 5 AI signals every CIO should be watching right now\n\n## Other Sections\n\n### From our editors straight to your inbox\n\nClint Boulton [...] ## Preparing for the AI tidal wave\n\nThese best practices, designed to protect core and ancillary business operations against systemic outages, cybersecurity attacks, and other risks, are all critical arrows in the IT resiliency quiver. Collectively, these approaches will take on greater importance as organizations grow their consumption of AI workloads.\n\nWhile most organizations are not yet launching agentic AI en masse, the technology will exponentially increase business risks when it mainstreams. After all, while agentic systems may scale productivity, they can also wreck “your entire organization at scale,” says Dickson, citing last year’s incident of how an agentic coding tool deleted a whole database.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To support the rollout, the bank is providing its people with AI education, including masterclasses, support resources and prompt-a-thons. It has also introduced Copilot Studio, which the Technology, Data and AI teams will use to build custom AI agents. Already the teams have built several agents, including for HR and IT to instantly answer common employee questions and handle simple tasks. A dedicated innovation sandbox has also been introduced on Microsoft Azure to encourage experimentation and development of new AI-driven solutions. [...] “Giving our teams access to these environments will accelerate innovation and encourage new ideas – whether that’s custom agents, workflow automation or analytical models. AI will completely reshape how we work and eventually how customers engage with our products and services. The potential is enormous,” McMullan said.\n\nDuncan Taylor, General Manager of Financial Services at Microsoft ANZ, said Westpac’s introduction of AI for all employees demonstrates a commitment to its people and leadership in delivering AI innovation at scale.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Start small and define success clearly\n\nThe first question you need to answer isn’t “what can this agent do?” but rather “what problem are we solving?” Too many teams start by building an agent that tries to handle every possible scenario. This leads to complexity, slow iteration cycles, and agents that don’t excel at anything.\n\nInstead, work backwards from a specific use case. If you’re building a financial assistant, start with the three most common analyst tasks. If you’re building an HR helper, focus on the top five employee questions. Get those working reliably before expanding scope.\n\nYour initial planning should produce four concrete deliverables: [...] ## Automate evaluation from the start\n\nYou need to know whether your agent is getting better or worse with each change you make. Automated evaluation gives you this feedback loop. Start by defining what “good” means for your specific use case. The metrics will vary depending on the industry and task:\n\n A customer service agent might be measured on resolution rate and customer satisfaction.\n A financial analyst agent might be measured on calculation accuracy and citation quality.\n An HR assistant might be measured on policy accuracy and response completeness. [...] Building production-ready AI agents requires careful planning and execution across the entire development lifecycle. The difference between a prototype that impresses in a demo and an agent that delivers value in production is achieved through disciplined engineering practices, robust architecture, and continuous improvement.\n\nThis post explores nine essential best practices for building enterprise AI agents using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The best ERP software of 2026: Expert tested and reviewed&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Show less\n\nView now at Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 has the smoothest business technology ecosystem. It integrates well with Microsoft products like Office 365, Teams, and Power BI. This makes workflows feel natural for businesses already using Microsoft tools. You can choose specific applications -- like sales, finance, or customer service, instead of investing in the entire suite right away.\n\nMicrosoft&#x27;s Copilot AI makes a big difference in productivity. You can automate many routine tasks and gather smart insights based on available data. For example, I analyzed customer data from emails, social media, and phone calls to get lots of useful insights. I could even build complete customer profiles from the data it gleaned. [...] When reviewing ERP software providers like SAP, I wanted to first understand how they&#x27;d help leaders in finance, operations, and supply chain management in their day-to-day. I also considered scalability, user experience, and how easily users could adopt the system. Integration costs, including implementation and support, were also important. I paid extra attention to AI features, plus cloud deployment options.\n\nAlso:The best password managers for businesses: Expert tested\n\nAs a B2B tech journalist, I&#x27;ve researched tons of HR, accounting, and financial planning and analysis vendors over the years. You could say I&#x27;ve got some idea of where ERP systems fit into the larger business workspace. If you&#x27;re looking for an ERP platform, scroll on. I go into more detail about these vendors below. [...] However, implementing the system can be tough, especially for small to midsize businesses without dedicated IT support. Customization is powerful but can result in complex setups that need ongoing specialists to manage. Microsoft&#x27;s subscription model can also get expensive quickly as businesses add users and modules. Still, Dynamics 365 is a strong choice for those who need close Microsoft integration and the ability to expand their ERP powers over time.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 features: Microsoft ecosystem integration | Copilot AI assistance | Modular application suite | Power Platform connectivity | Real-time analytics | Workflow automation | Mobile accessibility\n\nPros\n\n Seamless Microsoft integration\n Flexible modular approach\n AI-powered automation\n\nCons&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The hard yards of enterprise AI: What it really takes to make ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## 6. Use AI to elevate humans, not replace them.\n\nOne of the most exciting things we’re building with Agentforce is what we call the Wingman: an AI agent that sits alongside reps, offering real-time guidance, sentiment analysis, and quality assurance.\n\nThis isn’t about automation for its own sake. It’s about empowerment, giving all our reps a new superpower that enables them to have more powerful and higher converting conversations.\n\nIn the case of call quality, the impact is game-changing. Our Wingman shifts compliance from an opaque back-office activity and puts reps fully in control of their own call quality.\n\n## 7. Play the long game.\n\nEnterprise AI requires a leap of faith. [...] You can deliver AI quickly - often in days or weeks, but value doesn’t arrive on a fixed schedule. Spoiler alert: AI is not going to transform your business overnight!\n\nMany organizations assume AI agents will instantly improve as they’re exposed to internal data, but LLMs don’t automatically learn from your systems or customer interactions. They’re pre-trained, not self-updating.\n\nTo deliver reliable, high-quality responses, AI agents need an intentional cycle of continuous review and refinement. That means business teams regularly reviewing transcripts, updating instructions, tuning responses, and enriching the knowledge base over time.\n\nThis isn’t a sign that the technology is falling short. It is the work.\n\n## 6. Use AI to elevate humans, not replace them. [...] Whether the answer becomes bigger or smaller models, the organizations that will win aren’t the ones chasing the flashiest use cases. They’re the ones doing the hard yards: integrating AI deeply, refining it continuously, and staying focused on real business outcomes.\n\n&gt; ### If you can’t tie AI initiatives directly to operational metrics, you’re probably still stuck in experimentation mode.\n&gt;\n&gt; James Lomas\n&gt;\n&gt; Chief Technology Officer, Bionic\n\n## Read the full story\n\nCustomer Story\n\n### Bionic boosts small business support with always-on help with Agentforce.\n\nAI agents handle first customer contact so reps have more time for 1:1 support.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Take the next step with Salesforce.\n\n### Get free CRM.&quot;,

From there, we can scale to complex, custom scenarios, and ultimately architect multi-layer agentic designs – where multiple agents collaborate and communicate autonomously, unlocking the true vision of the Salesforce Agentic Enterprise.

By combining a robust, mathematical core with the reasoning power of agents, we are moving from “automated” to “autonomous.”\n\nIn the next articles of this blog series, we will introduce our experts who will detail the specific considerations I’ve mentioned in this article – from data readiness to the nuances of change management, from optimization ready to unleashing the power of AI waves. But for now, the gist is clear: Build your foundation while working with the experts, trust the core, and ride the waves to take your organization to the next level.\n\n## Share article\n\n## Just For You&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workday Named Best in KLAS for ERP for Large ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;About Workday\n\nWorkday is the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents. Workday unifies HR and Finance on one intelligent platform with AI at the core to empower people at every level with the clarity, confidence, and insights they need to adapt quickly, make better decisions, and deliver outcomes that matter. Workday is used by more than 11,000 organizations around the world and across industries – from medium-sized businesses to more than 65% of the Fortune 500.

All other brand and product names are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders.\n\nForward-Looking Statements [...] PLEASANTON, Calif., Feb. 4, 2026 —  Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents, today announced that KLAS Research recognized Workday as the 2026 Best in KLAS winner for ERP for large organizations. Workday was also named Best in KLAS for Talent Management. This achievement marks nine consecutive years at the top of the rankings, a streak driven by Workday’s ability to simplify finance and HR, reduce administrative burden, and give staff more time to focus on patient care. [...] Faced with shrinking margins and critical staffing shortages, healthcare providers can no longer afford the friction of disconnected systems. Workday is delivering the next generation of ERP, redefined for the AI era. While legacy ERP is a transactional system of record, Workday is a system of action that understands the business, anticipates needs, and helps healthcare leaders reimagine how work gets done. By unifying HR, finance, and supply chain management into a single platform with AI at its core, Workday helps eliminate fragmented processes and provide real-time visibility. This enables healthcare organizations of all sizes to unlock operational efficiencies and reclaim the time spent on administrative hurdles, helping to shift the focus back to patient-centered care.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality check: preparing for a silicon-based ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This strategic redesign is already taking shape across industries. At HPE, an enterprise software and services company, an AI agent called Alfred supports internal operational performance reviews. Toyota uses agentic tools to gain real-time visibility into vehicle arrivals at dealerships and is planning to empower agents to resolve supply chain issues - bypassing the need for human interaction with complex mainframe systems. These examples signal a shift away from traditional application modernization toward enabling agents to bridge legacy system gaps directly. [...] Enterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human - AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the full Deloitte Tech Trends report.\n\n### Contact\n\n#### Andrei Ionescu\n\nMarket Leader Consulting\n\naionescu@deloittece.com&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The best ERP software of 2026: Expert tested and reviewed&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Show less\n\nView now at Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 has the smoothest business technology ecosystem. It integrates well with Microsoft products like Office 365, Teams, and Power BI. This makes workflows feel natural for businesses already using Microsoft tools. You can choose specific applications -- like sales, finance, or customer service, instead of investing in the entire suite right away.\n\nMicrosoft&#x27;s Copilot AI makes a big difference in productivity. You can automate many routine tasks and gather smart insights based on available data. For example, I analyzed customer data from emails, social media, and phone calls to get lots of useful insights. I could even build complete customer profiles from the data it gleaned. [...] However, implementing the system can be tough, especially for small to midsize businesses without dedicated IT support. Customization is powerful but can result in complex setups that need ongoing specialists to manage. Microsoft&#x27;s subscription model can also get expensive quickly as businesses add users and modules. Still, Dynamics 365 is a strong choice for those who need close Microsoft integration and the ability to expand their ERP powers over time.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 features: Microsoft ecosystem integration | Copilot AI assistance | Modular application suite | Power Platform connectivity | Real-time analytics | Workflow automation | Mobile accessibility\n\nPros\n\n Seamless Microsoft integration\n Flexible modular approach\n AI-powered automation\n\nCons [...] Also, the platform&#x27;s AI features are more than just marketing talk. They improve daily operations with predictive analytics and intelligent automation. I loved how the system learns from user behavior. It suggests optimal workflows and spots bottlenecks before they even have a chance to affect operations. Embedded analytics give you great visibility into business performance. Managers can drill down from high-level dashboards to detailed transaction data without switching apps.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Collection\n\n### Resilience\n\nDeloitte partners with you to help your organisation meet today’s and future challenges and make resilience a driver of long‑term growth.\n\n### Work, reworked: What it takes to win in the age of Agentic AI\n\n### How to trust Generative AI and make it work for your organisation\n\nPerspective [...] ##### The autonomy-trust balance\n\nTo be trusted in the era of autonomous systems, with AI as a stepping stone, organisations, governments and public service need to repeatedly prove that digital systems are acting as intended. Autonomy without evidence invites regulatory action, customer defection, public backlash, or loss of stakeholder confidence. Trust without autonomy risks slowness and loss of competitive edge. And autonomy without human oversight invites loss of control. [...] ##### What digital leadership means\n\nDigital leadership is the capacity to turn digital capability into lasting value while taking responsibility for outcomes. It is not only about technology but about how people, processes, data and incentives are organised. It requires governance structures that enable safe experimentation, cultural practices that encourage transparency and accountability, and metrics that demonstrate trustworthiness over time.\n\nAn organisation&#x27;s culture is pivotal to achieving the right balance between autonomy and trust: the norms, rituals and incentives inside an organisation will determine whether autonomous systems scale responsibly or degrade to become an uncontrollable risk.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Accelerating your marketing ideation with generative AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Marketing teams face major challenges creating campaigns in today’s digital environment. They must navigate through complex data analytics and rapidly changing consumer preferences to produce engaging, personalized content across multiple channels while maintaining brand consistency and working within tight deadlines. Using generative AI can streamline and accelerate the creative process while maintaining alignment with business objectives. Indeed, according to McKinsey’s “The State of AI in 2023” report, 72% of organizations now integrate AI into their operations, with marketing emerging as a key area of implementation. [...] ```\n{ \&quot;statusCode\&quot;: 201, \&quot;body\&quot;: { \&quot;labels_list\&quot;: [ \&quot;baseball player in white t-shirt\&quot;, \&quot;baseball player in green t-shirt\&quot;, \&quot;blue helmet\&quot;, \&quot;green cap\&quot;, \&quot;baseball glove\&quot;, \&quot;baseball field\&quot;, \&quot;trees\&quot;, \&quot;grass\&quot; ], \&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;An image showing two people playing baseball.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Quick Suite is an enterprise AI platform that provides generative AI-powered capabilities for workplace productivity and business intelligence. It brings AI-powered research, business intelligence, and automation capabilities into a single workspace and can tackle a wide range of tasks—from answering questions and generating content, to analyzing data and providing strategic insights. To extend its capabilities beyond basic data searching, Amazon Quick Suite offers action connectors, powerful components that allow interaction with external enterprise systems. With these action connectors, users can perform actions and access information from various business tools while staying within the Amazon Quick Suite interface. [...] ## Start small and define success clearly\n\nThe first question you need to answer isn’t “what can this agent do?” but rather “what problem are we solving?” Too many teams start by building an agent that tries to handle every possible scenario. This leads to complexity, slow iteration cycles, and agents that don’t excel at anything.\n\nInstead, work backwards from a specific use case. If you’re building a financial assistant, start with the three most common analyst tasks. If you’re building an HR helper, focus on the top five employee questions. Get those working reliably before expanding scope.\n\nYour initial planning should produce four concrete deliverables: [...] The observability strategy should include three layers:\n\n Enable trace-level debugging during development so you can see the steps of each conversation. When users report incorrect behavior, pull up the specific trace and see exactly what the agent did.\n Set up dashboards for production monitoring using the Amazon CloudWatch Generative AI observability dashboards that come with AgentCore Observability.\n Track token usage, latency percentiles, error rates, and tool invocation patterns. Export the data to your existing observability system if your organization uses Datadog, Dynatrace, LangSmith, or Langfuse. The figure below shows how AgentCore Observability allows you to deep dive into your agent’s trace and meta data information inside a session invocation:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI Agent Performance Measurement: Redefining Excellence&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Perhaps most critically, reasoning quality includes knowing what the agent doesn’t know. A well-designed agent admits uncertainty rather than fabricating answers. This is particularly challenging in the LLM where models are trained to produce answers no matter what. There are two parts to that problem, one the agent should reason and ask for additional data. In truly autonomous agents such interactions should go beyond slot filling or interview. It needs to be dynamic, adaptive, and contextual.  When the agent feels stuck, it should admit that and either ask for help from supervisor or simply escalate. In any case, responsible AI guardrails and validations are key to ensuring proper agent responses and guarded interactions.

A well-designed agent can operate in Controller mode for straightforward technical issues- direct and prescriptive-and shift to Empathizer mode when a customer shares difficult news. It adapts mid-conversation based on sentiment, issue complexity, and customer preferences.\n\nThis isn’t about mimicking personality types. It’s about dynamically deploying the right approach for each moment of each interaction. The best AI agents don’t choose between being helpful and being efficient. They recognize that true helpfulness often means being efficient. They adapt their communication style to what each customer needs in each moment.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## 4. Support the next generation\n\nDawn McCarroll, director of supply chain and business excellence at telecoms specialist Helios Towers, said that integrity is key to proving you&#x27;re ready for responsibility.\n\n\&quot;You need to know that trust is essential to move anything of significance forward,\&quot; she said. \&quot;A lot of people talk about emotional intelligence, but I think you need a balance of emotional and perceptual intelligence.\&quot;\n\nMcCarroll told ZDNET that perceptual intelligence is not just about how people perceive you, but how you perceive others and how you maintain conversations with them.\n\nAlso: 10 ways AI can inflict unprecedented damage in 2026\n\nShe also said people moving into management positions must start thinking about how they&#x27;ll give similar opportunities to others. [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s also about thinking commercially -- being able to demonstrate that you understand how the operational decisions you make, in whatever aspect you&#x27;re leading, impact top and bottom-line business value.

They must understand what&#x27;s going on across the business and how it all links up. So, build connections and collaborate where possible with others outside your direct area of control,\&quot; he said. [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s those kinds of opinions and contributions that get you noticed, not being a great data person, because people will assume you&#x27;re good at that area. After all, that&#x27;s why the board hired you.\&quot;\n\n## 2. Show your commitment\n\nJason Pyle, COO at recruitment specialist Harvey Nash, said that making the breakthrough from manager to senior executive means demonstrating you think strategically rather than just operationally.\n\n\&quot;Show that you understand the organization&#x27;s wider strategy and how your role and the team you lead fit within that approach,\&quot; he said.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI is collapsing the career ladder - 5 ways to reach that ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;You need to show tact and political acumen. Don&#x27;t overstep the mark. Take the initiative by putting your hand up for projects and special pieces of work that need to be managed. Show willingness and commitment, although be careful not to overload yourself.\&quot;\n\n## 3. Stay humble\n\nJoe Depa, global chief innovation officer at consultant EY, said successful leaders stay open to the opinions of a broad range of stakeholders and partners.\n\n\&quot;That humility right now is going to be critical,\&quot; he said. \&quot;When I look at successful leaders that I tend to model myself after, I think the key to success is not only having the ability to learn but also having the mindset that you don&#x27;t know all the answers.\&quot;\n\nAlso: Turn AI chaos into a career opportunity by preparing for these 4 scenarios [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s also about thinking commercially -- being able to demonstrate that you understand how the operational decisions you make, in whatever aspect you&#x27;re leading, impact top and bottom-line business value. Think like a business shareholder, not just a manager of your team.\&quot;\n\nAlso: Nervous about the job market? 5 ways to stand out in the age of AI\n\nPyle told ZDNET that senior professionals must be willing and able to smash the glass ceiling.\n\n\&quot;An executive can&#x27;t just sit in their box and work in a silo. They must understand what&#x27;s going on across the business and how it all links up. So, build connections and collaborate where possible with others outside your direct area of control,\&quot; he said. [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s those kinds of opinions and contributions that get you noticed, not being a great data person, because people will assume you&#x27;re good at that area. After all, that&#x27;s why the board hired you.\&quot;\n\n## 2. Show your commitment\n\nJason Pyle, COO at recruitment specialist Harvey Nash, said that making the breakthrough from manager to senior executive means demonstrating you think strategically rather than just operationally.\n\n\&quot;Show that you understand the organization&#x27;s wider strategy and how your role and the team you lead fit within that approach,\&quot; he said.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The accountability gap in autonomous AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI challenges all three of these assumptions. Autonomous agents are non-deterministic, operate at machine speed, and act continuously across APIs, tools and environments. In this model, identity is no longer stable human account or long-lived service principal. It can be ephemeral and purpose-built for a specific capability, workflow or even a single transaction, then revoked immediately after execution.\n\nAn end-to-end agentic flow has many agents logging in once, each running a discrete activitity. They don’t “log in” once. They might make thousands of decisions per hour, often on behalf of users, systems or other agents. They have an identity themselves and engage with each other in end-to-end transactional flows that span trust boundaries. [...] This issue isn’t a tooling gap; it’s a governance gap that must be closed.\n\n## The shift: From identity as access to identity as authority\n\nThe core mistake enterprises make is treating agent identity as a credential problem. Credentials are important, but in agentic systems they’re no longer a single login event that establishes trust for everything that follows.\n\nInstead, agents operate continuously, start multiple tools, cross systems, and take many independent actions over time. That means identity and authorization can’t be “set once” at the start of a session; they must be validated and enforced throughout the workflow.\n\nAgentic AI requires a shift from access control to authority control. This means: [...] Unique agent identities with strong access management controls\n Designs that consider human and machine identities together\n Full end-to-end audit trails\n Clear processes around just-in-time and just-enough access with revocation\n\nAttackers are moving faster than defenders—targeting AI agents precisely because they likely operate with accumulated privilege and low oversight.\n\nAgentic AI isn’t coming. It’s here. The question is no longer whether agents will execute business-critical actions—it’s whether enterprises can prove that those actions were authorized, scoped and accountable.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This automation directly improves time to resolution and first-call resolution (an IT team’s ability to resolve a customer issue on the first call). This improvement in turn reduces support costs and improves user satisfaction. At the same time, CrushBank’s customers can display those same AI capabilities as added value offerings to their own end customers. This approach unlocks a new revenue path without standing up their own AI platform from scratch.\n\n## The architecture: A lakehouse and agentic layer built on watsonx\n\nCrushBank has built a hybrid, agentic architecture that treats enterprise data as the foundation of every AI workflow. IBM technologies provide the data plane, the AI plane and the orchestration layer that make this possible (see image presented further ahead). [...] From a TCO perspective, this process means a CrushBank customer can:\n\n Reuse the same lakehouse, models and agents to solve multiple triage and routing problems.\n Avoid buying point solutions or licensing generic copilots per user when what they really need is domain-specific, multi-tenant AI wired into their core workflows.\n\n## Scaling with IBM: From IT tickets to an AI platform business\n\nCrushBank is now working with multiple partners who resell its platform, enabling MSPs and other providers to bring AI capabilities to hundreds of end customers without needing to build, secure and scale their own data and AI stacks.\n\nBecause the architecture is agentic, data-centric and embedded by design, scaling typically entails: [...] Full object storage\n\n The original documents are retained as full objects in Cloud Object Storage for traceability, auditability and direct retrieval when necessary.\n\nWatsonx.data and IBM Cloud provide CrushBank a single logical platform to query and combine structured and unstructured data. This approach leaves the door open to future capabilities that extract structured fields directly from documents (like invoices or medical billing records) with watsonx.data’s intelligence tools and data ingestion.\n\n### 3. Agentic Layer with watsonx Orchestrate, watsonx.ai, Flows Engine and Langflow\n\nOn top of the data plane, CrushBank has built an agentic orchestration layer powered by IBM.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Vijay Bhaskaran\n\nArtificial Intelligence has the potential to inspire new ways of helping businesses and governments alike, to overcome some of the greatest challenges by augmenting human intelligence. It also means using that intelligence to create new services, anticipate what citizens &amp; customers will need next and take actions for the new Digital first normal.\n\n### We invest in our people and technology to power the human enterprise of the future [...] ### Work with global organizations, advanced technologies and transformative leaders\n\nIn a technology career at EY, you could be collaborating with global organizations like GE Digital, IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, LinkedIn and SAP. You’ll help to set a new standard for the way we can use emerging technologies, such as AI, blockchain, internet of things, and data analytics.\n\nAs well as having access to leading-edge technologies, you get to work with some of the brightest minds across each industry to explore powerful new ideas. You’ll have access to professionals in different disciplines, all working together to make a real impact on the way the world works today.\n\n### Today’s technologies, tomorrow’s solutions [...] ### Artificial intelligence, human impact\n\nAt some point in the future, humans will have more daily interactions with bots than they do with each other. When we talk about a career at EY in AI, we believe it’s less about the technology itself, and more about its application. We really are at the tip of the iceberg in understanding the impact it can have across sectors such as healthcare, clean energy and even food production. Here at EY, we say that bots are built, but AI is applied. Your career in AI will give you a global platform to work with a technology that could eventually change not just the world — but the health of our planet.\n\nExperienced professionals&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI models are becoming cheap and interchangeable; if you’re still betting on tools instead of workflows, data and people, you’re running behind.\n\n### 5 IT shifts every CIO must master this year\n\nThis year’s IT playbook is clear: Hybrid everywhere, AI guarding security, data treated like a product, automation doing the heavy lifting and compute moving to the edge.\n\n### Agentic AI isn’t about the agents. It’s about the platform\n\nAgents aren’t the hard part — scaling them is, and without a solid platform underneath, agentic AI quickly turns into chaos instead of impact.\n\n## CIO Leadership Live\n\n### Rockwell Automation CDIO on IT, AI and Manufacturing Resilience [...] ## Podcasts\n\nImage\n\n### Putting the I in AI\n\nIn the blink of an eye, AI tools have gone from innovative to tables stakes. It’s time to acknowledge a fundamental truth: If you’re not using AI today, you will be tomorrow. The question isn’t if you will adopt this transformative tool, but how. In this podcast series, we explore how Intel and its partners are enabling scalable, affordable, and secure AI — from adoption to implementation. Each episode, we’ll meet a new Intel partner and explore how they enable business transformation through the smart and thoughtful application of AI.\n\n### Insights from HCLTech and Intel: How AI PCs are reshaping enterprise productivity\n\n### Lessons from Intel and Wipro: Building an enterprise-wide AI strategy\n\n## All Events\n\nImage [...] ### Executives hyped for AI revenue, but unclear how\n\n### 10 ways to grow as an IT leader in 2026\n\n## State of the CIO Survey 2025\n\n## Recent news &amp; fresh reads\n\n### Nvidia and Dassault Systèmes combine digital twins and AI in industry world models\n\nThe companies want to ground AI models in science and engineering to grow industrial know-how.\n\n### When the AI goes dark: Building enterprise resilience for the age of agentic AI\n\nEnterprises are racing to build AI-dependent operations, but the most overlooked resilience lay-er might not be technical.\n\n### 1.5 million AI agents are at risk of going rogue\n\nA survey of large firms in the US and UK finds that more than half of the deployed agents are not actively monitored or secured.&quot;,
