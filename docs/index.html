  <li><strong>Workday and Microsoft Progress Delivery of Unified AI Agent Experience (2025-09-16)</strong><br/>
    On September 16, <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday and Microsoft</a> announced a joint initiative to deliver a unified AI agent experience, integrating Workday agentic automation with Microsoft Copilot for seamless, cross-system HR and finance workflows. This sets Workday apart in interoperability, crucial for Deloitte clients seeking value from SaaS investments and workflow orchestration.<br/>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Workday Expands Agent Partner Network with New Ventures Partners (2025-09-16)</strong><br/>
    The recent expansion of Workday’s Agent Partner Network adds a cadre of innovation-focused partners, as detailed at <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Expands-Agent-Partner-Network-With-New-Ventures-Partners-to-Deliver-Enterprise-Ready-AI-Agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Newsroom</a>. This broadens the set of deployable AI agents, enhances marketplace options, and demands continual partner evaluation by Deloitte teams for secure, scalable delivery.<br/>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI Remains Central as Workday Achieves Top AI Certifications (2025-06-12)</strong><br/>
    Workday’s certifications, announced <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-12-Workday-Achieves-Top-AI-Certifications,-Reinforcing-Commitment-to-Responsible-AI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, establish a technical and ethical baseline for AI programs. This trust infrastructure is pivotal for clients in regulated spaces and differentiates Deloitte’s AI risk and value advisory.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Workday AI Agents: Maturing Use Cases and Proof Points (2025-09-17)</strong><br/>
    Workday is rolling out expanded agentic automation across HR and finance (<a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2024-09-17-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agents-to-Transform-HR-and-Finance-Processes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>), including personalized onboarding and automated reconciliation. These successes underpin Deloitte’s advisory, business case, and transformation approaches for Workday programs.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP:</strong> SAP is embedding agentic AI in SuccessFactors HR and planning, amplifying automation and user experience (<a href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/explore-sap-successfactors-solutions/leveraging-ai-capabilities-in-sap-successfactors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details</a>). Deloitte teams should guide clients on platform maturity, vendor selection, and cross-ecosystem integration strategy.
  </li>
  <li><strong>UKG:</strong> UKG Bryte AI Suite and the new Marketplace AI Hub (<a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>, <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-launches-ai-hub-ukg-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Hub</a>) focus on employee experience and workflow productivity. Deloitte must support clients with robust ROI frameworks and multi-vendor AI adoption guidance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dayforce:</strong> Investment in conversational AI and productivity features elevates the Dayforce Assistant (<a href="https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-announces-dayforce-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">news</a>, <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/how-we-help/dayforce/leverage-ai-for-efficiency/dayforce-ai-assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assistant</a>). For clients with hybrid HCM, integration and change management will be key.

</ul>

For Deloitte and its clients, the fusion of agent experiences, partner ecosystem growth, and governance remains the core lens for value acceleration and risk management.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday and Microsoft Progress Delivery of Unified AI Agent Experience (2025-09-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On September 16, Workday and Microsoft announced a joint initiative to deliver a unified AI agent experience for the enterprise, signaling a pivotal move for Workday platform extensibility and enterprise AI adoption. This partnership integrates Workday’s next-gen agentic framework with Microsoft Copilot, enabling seamless workflows across HR, finance, and collaboration domains. Clients can expect agents that not only automate repetitive HR and finance processes but also act in context within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.\\n\\nStrategically, this sets Workday apart by prioritizing interoperability—a critical differentiator as organizations aim to maximize ROI from their SaaS and productivity tools. The integration reduces user friction, increases process automation opportunities, and enables richer, cross-functional agentic automation. Deloitte’s Workday practice can leverage this extensibility to design holistic employee and manager experiences, strengthening ties between Workday, Microsoft platforms, and clients’ digital workflow ambitions.\\n\\nThe move also reinforces Workday’s ambition to remain at the center of enterprise workflow and knowledge orchestration, competing directly with similar efforts from SAP (with Microsoft), Oracle, and ServiceNow. The news reiterates the necessity for partners and clients to develop agentic fluency that cuts across multiple core systems.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Expands Agent Partner Network with New Ventures Partners (2025-09-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Announced recently, Workday&#x27;s expansion of its Agent Partner Network adds a new cadre of ventures and solution providers focused on enterprise-ready AI agents. This development broadens the spectrum of deployable AI solutions on the Workday platform, enabling clients to select from an ecosystem that balances Workday-native offerings with best-of-breed innovations from accredited partners. The scale of this network signals rapid maturation of Workday’s AI agent marketplace strategy.\\n\\nFrom a strategic standpoint, the partner network is crucial for addressing diverse industry and functional requirements, particularly as organizations adopt composable and customizable SaaS environments. Workday is signaling its intent to be the preferred platform-of-record for enterprise AI orchestration, with open APIs and extensibility for specialist providers through its AI Marketplace.\\n\\nFor Deloitte and clients, this means expanded solutioning capabilities and faster deployment cycles, with an imperative to stay abreast of the expanding partner ecosystem and integration best practices. Monitoring marketplace activity and vetting partner innovations for security, scalability, and domain fit will become a routine aspect of Workday program governance.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-Expands-Agent-Partner-Network-With-New-Ventures-Partners-to-Deliver-Enterprise-Ready-AI-Agents\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI Remains Central as Workday Achieves Top AI Certifications (2025-06-12)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;While not within the last 48 hours, this June update remains highly relevant amid the uptick in agentic AI deployments. Workday achieving top AI certifications demonstrates a proactive stance on responsible AI, fairness, and compliance—a priority as organizations increase their reliance on autonomous AI for decision support and operations. Workday’s certifications backstop client confidence and are a lever for Deloitte to differentiate with clients, especially in regulated and sensitive sectors.\\n\\nTechnically, these accolades affirm Workday’s governed machine learning lifecycle and bias mitigation. Strategically, Workday embeds a defensible compliance posture within its product DNA, supporting organizations facing legal, ethical, and employee trust risks around AI-driven processes. \\n\\nFor Deloitte, these certifications and transparent governance commitments are a key talking point in client engagements, supporting both risk mitigation and value realization as agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in business processes and workforce management.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-12-Workday-Achieves-Top-AI-Certifications,-Reinforcing-Commitment-to-Responsible-AI\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday AI Agents: Maturing Use Cases and Proof Points (2025-09-17)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday continues to enrich its library of agentic AI use cases in both HR and finance, as documented in the September 17 announcement. These include conversational talent acquisition, guided onboarding, personalized learning, and automated payroll reconciliation, all orchestrated through Illuminate™ and the AI Marketplace. By providing detailed, quantified examples of agent-driven efficiency and employee satisfaction, Workday crystallizes the ROI for current and prospective clients.\\n\\nFor clients and services partners, these expanded use cases—and the underlying platform improvements to Extend and Skills Cloud—offer both a roadmap for quick wins and a scaffolding for more sophisticated, composable automation initiatives. There is a growing expectation for Workday experts to deploy and tune agents not only for efficiency but also for quality outcomes in workforce and financial management.\\n\\nDeloitte’s Workday team should emphasize the emerging body of proof points, leverage quantifiable KPIs in transformation business cases, and proactively guide clients through agent selection, piloting, and post-deployment optimization.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2024-09-17-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agents-to-Transform-HR-and-Finance-Processes\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP continues to showcase its agentic AI capabilities within SAP SuccessFactors, focusing on business process automation for HR and workforce planning.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s deep integration of agentic AI within its broader business suite signals intensifying competition in process automation and user experience. For Deloitte, clients must weigh the maturity and integration options of SAP’s agentic platform versus Workday, especially in multi-cloud and multi-SaaS contexts. SAP’s investments reinforce the urgency for Workday clients to accelerate their agentic journey, maintain competitive parity in automation, and ensure alignment between their platform and ecosystem partner strategies (https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/explore-sap-successfactors-solutions/leveraging-ai-capabilities-in-sap-successfactors).\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;UKG has rapidly advanced the Bryte AI agent suite, announcing new capabilities to transform employee experiences in the UKG Pro HCM platform.

With the launch of the UKG AI Hub, UKG is moving closer to parity with Workday’s AI Marketplace.
