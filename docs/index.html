<ul>
<li><b>No Major Announcements from Workday or Key Ecosystem Players (Dec 22–23, 2025)</b><br/><p>Across primary Workday investor communications, press releases, and broad HR and technology news sources, there were no significant announces, launches, or disclosures directly impacting Workday HCM, Workday Extend, AI Marketplace, Skills Cloud, or agentic AI practices within SaaS HR in the last 24 hours. </p><p>This relative quiet is notable given the pace of innovation and competitive activity seen in recent weeks—especially among major GSIs, competitors like Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow, and within the AI governance space.</p><p>For Deloitte’s Workday practice and client community, decision-making should remain focused on ongoing rollouts, risk management, and readiness for core updates identified earlier in December. With the holiday period potentially masking end-of-year product launches and risk bulletins, staying proactive and closely monitoring official channels is essential. (<a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Newsroom</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>SAP, Oracle, UKG, Dayforce</b>: No new agentic AI or HCM feature releases or notable partner programs identified in the last 24 hours.<br/><p>This stability provides an opportunity for Workday clients and Deloitte teams to consolidate ongoing projects, focus on enablement around existing releases, and anticipate the typically busy cycle starting in January. Vigilance is nonetheless advised, as competitors often use holiday periods for silent go-lives or low-profile rollouts.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Workday AI Governance and Responsible AI Practices</b> – <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Governance at Workday</a><br/><p>Understanding Workday’s responsible AI governance framework is essential for both risk mitigation and proactive client communication. In the next 90 days, practitioners should focus on embedding these principles in client engagements to increase trust and regulatory confidence.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor official Workday newsroom and leading HR tech industry sources daily for potential year-end product or AI agent updates.</li>
<li>Engage with client teams to reiterate AI governance, risk, and data compliance measures, referencing Workday’s responsible AI documentation.</li>
<li>Prepare summary notes and scenario responses in anticipation of traditionally high January activity in the HCM and SaaS AI market.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Risk:</b> Potential for last-minute or unanticipated HR tech releases during the holiday period.<br/><b>Mitigation:</b> Assign ecosystem monitoring duties and prepare a rapid response mechanism for Deloitte advisory and product teams.</li>
</ul>

With the holiday period potentially masking end-of-year product launches and risk bulletins, staying proactive and closely monitoring official channels is essential.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Some researchers worry about the broader trajectory.Todd Cherner, who directs an educational technology program at the University of North Carolina, told IBM Think that “the advancing capability of AI agents is provocative. I think the future is headed to AGI faster than people are aware. We should make good use of what we have before really pushing for AGI.” [...] For 2026, Varshney expects continued experimentation rather than dramatic breakthroughs. “Not everything has to be exactly a transformer,” he said. Mihalcea offered a similar forecast: “smaller specialized mix of expert models, leveraging multi-agent systems.” When asked whether big leaps are coming, Varshney was cautious. “There’s always a chance...another ChatGPT moment,” he said. “But I don’t expect that.” The honest answer is that nobody knows. [...] Practitioners are already adapting to this new landscape.Jayashankar Swaminathan, a Professor of Global Operations at UNC Kenan-Flagler, told IBM Think that “the biggest advancements are around...autonomous agentic capability, where AI is now able to do multiple tasks in a simple order. The second relates to reasoning the logic behind the decision-making.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When automation and AI operate in tandem, governance shifts from reactive control to continuous assurance. Policy rules execute the moment data lands, while learning algorithms observe usage patterns and fine-tune safeguards in the background. Quality checks, lineage updates, and access rights automatically sync so analysts can focus on insights instead of validation. [...] By integrating AI-driven insights into your governance engine, you create a system that not only enforces rules but anticipates issues, continuously refines controls, and empowers your team to focus on strategy rather than data maintenance.\n\n&gt; Gartner predicts that without a catalyst for modernization, 80% of data governance strategies will fail by 2027.\n\n## Solutions for a Strong Governance Foundation [...] While automation rapidly executes across governance pillars, it still runs on fixed rules.

[...] I joined ADP in 2014 as part of the innovation lab that went on to become ADP’s next gen HCM. When I started here, we were primarily running our own data centers. Over the next year, we effectively spearheaded the migration of our product into the cloud and inspired the broader ADP enterprise to move to the cloud as well.\n\nSaaS Factory: What products and solutions has ADP built on AWS?&quot;,

[...] Problem: Without clear boundaries, AI might include sensitive information in summaries. \n\nWhat to Do: \n\nExample: There is an instance where health-related details were pulled into AI summaries from unrestricted comment fields. This was resolved by excluding those fields and updating agent guidance on secure data entry. \n\n  \n\nTrain Agents and Keep Them in the Loop \n\n  \n\nProblem: Without proper onboarding, agents either don’t trust the AI or trust it too much. \n\n  \n\nWhat to Do: [...] Example: In one case, AI helped summarize a complicated leave request. This saved agents time, but they also learned to change the output to remove personal information by following policy rules. It’s a great example of how training helps build trust and keep people responsible. \n\n  \n\nImprove the Knowledge Base That Feeds the AI \n\n  \n\nProblem: Case deflection and search adoption is low if your knowledge base isn’t clean or well-organized. \n\n  \n\nWhat to Do:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;After years of progressing toward lean IT and everything-as-a-service offerings, AI is sparking a shift away from virtualization and austere budgets. Long viewed as the lighthouse of digital transformation throughout the enterprise, the IT function is now taking on AI transformation. Because of Generative AI’s applicability to writing code, testing software, and augmenting tech talent in general, forward-thinking technology leaders are using the current moment as a once-in-a-blue-moon [...] opportunity to transform IT across five pillars: infrastructure, engineering, finance operations, talent, and innovation. As both traditional and Generative AI capabilities grow, every phase of tech delivery could see a shift from human in charge to human in the loop. Such a move could eventually return IT to a new form of lean IT, leveraging citizen developers and AI-driven automation. [...] To take advantage of the burgeoning excitement around Generative AI, many organizations have already adopted large language models (LLMs)—the best option for many use cases. But some are already looking ahead. Despite their general applicability, LLMs may not be the most efficient choice for all types of organizational needs. Enterprises are now considering small language models (SLMs) and open-source options for the ability to train such models on smaller, more accurate data sets. Together&quot;,

Layoffs and slowed hiring, tariff and inflation worries, and rapid AI‑era role shifts are elevating uncertainty.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Core systems providers have invested heavily in AI, rebuilding their offerings and capabilities around an AI-fueled or AI-first model. The integration of AI into core enterprise systems represents a significant shift in how organizations operate and leverage technology for competitive advantage. This transformation is about automating routine tasks and fundamentally rethinking and redesigning processes to be more intelligent, efficient, and predictive. It requires careful planning due to [...] with multimodal models and AI-based simulations, these new types of AI are building a future where enterprises can find the right type of AI for each task. This includes AI that can not only answer questions, but also complete burdensome administrative tasks. In the years to come, a focus on execution may usher in a new era of “agentic AI,” arming government employees with copilots capable of boosting efficiency and delivering enhanced impact on the lives of constituents. [...] After years of progressing toward lean IT and everything-as-a-service offerings, AI is sparking a shift away from virtualization and austere budgets. Long viewed as the lighthouse of digital transformation throughout the enterprise, the IT function is now taking on AI transformation. Because of Generative AI’s applicability to writing code, testing software, and augmenting tech talent in general, forward-thinking technology leaders are using the current moment as a once-in-a-blue-moon&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The workforce doubles down under pressure&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The call for clarity does not end with compensation; it also extends to the future of work in the age of AI. Employees broadly accept that AI is reshaping roles, but they are looking for more specifics and strategy from employers on how it will affect them: where responsibilities will shift, when changes will happen, and how workloads will be managed during transformation. Confidence about which skills matter to the business has declined since last year, and people are looking for more [...] The pressure out there is real. Macroeconomic anxiety hasn’t disappeared so much as shifted, as concerns about job security and role clarity now loom larger than day‑to‑day expense worries. AI is moving faster than many operating models, and some teams are running lean as organizations retool. It all adds up to a workplace where people want to stay — but want to see what staying will look like. [...] ### Economic and organizational outlooks\n\n### Technology’s promise is outrunning operating models\n\nAI has also become a sharp source of both anticipation and unease for employees. Sixty‑three percent of those surveyed say they are enthusiastic about AI’s potential to make work more efficient — but more than half expect it to affect their job security and 43% expect work to feel harder in the near term.\n\n43%\n\nagree new technology will make their job more frustrating or difficult\n\n53%&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is what defines an Agentic Enterprise in practice, where humans and AI operate side by side, with agents handling repeatable tasks, enforcing rules, and surfacing next-best actions in real time. The result is faster execution, higher productivity, and more consistent customer experiences without adding headcount.\n\nBy prioritizing operational AI over broad pilots, companies create durable performance gains that show up in EBITDA and exit readiness well before a sale process begins. [...] These markers aren’t cosmetic—they reduce diligence friction, accelerate integration planning, and improve buyer confidence.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nPrivate equity’s advantage has always been speed and precision. Today those strengths come from building portfolio companies into Agentic Enterprises- businesses that harness unified data, AI agents, and digital labor to operate more efficiently, improve productivity, and unlock entirely new revenue streams. [...] Accelerate go-to-market execution, reduce manual work, and augment teams with AI, agentic workflows and digital labor. The most effective portfolio companies focus on the Last Mile execution, embedding AI directly into sales, service, revenue, and finance workflows where work actually happens.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;From assistance to autonomy: How agentic AI is redefining ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Today, a new chapter is unfolding. Agentic AI, whose systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step orchestration, represents a significant evolution. These systems don’t just assist, they act. They evaluate context, weigh outcomes and autonomously initiate actions, orchestrating complex workflows across functions. They adapt dynamically and collaborate with other agents in ways that are beginning to reshape enterprise operations at large. [...] The enterprises that succeed will be those that approach agentic AI not as another tool, but as a strategic shift. Just as ERP and cloud once redefined operations, agentic AI is poised to do the same, reshaping workflows, governance, and the very way decisions are made. [...] That requires new thinking. Which decisions should remain human-led, and which can be delegated? How do you ensure agents access the correct data without overstepping boundaries? What happens when agents from finance, HR and supply chain must coordinate autonomously?\n\nThe design of workflows is no longer about linear handoffs; it is about orchestrated ecosystems. Enterprises that get this right can achieve speed and agility that traditional automation cannot match.&quot;,

But the use of chatbots, agents, and other AI tools presents as many risks as it does rewards -- especially at work. [...] Rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution, AI will likely deliver distinct benefits to particular industries and jobs. It&#x27;ll therefore be the responsibility of every individual to figure out how the technology fits within the unique contours and requirements of their particular role. The watchwords of the hour when it comes to the use of AI at work are experimentation and adaptation, not copy and paste.\n\nAlso: I test AI for a living, and these 3 free tools are the ones I used most in 2025 [...] But across the board, we&#x27;re currently undergoing something of an AI Cambrian Explosion: a blooming of tools and possibilities that could very well reshape virtually every job, at least to some degree. And just as the actual Cambrian Explosion was a period of unprecedented biological creativity, our present moment is an opportunity for workers of every kind to experiment with AI, and to write the rules around how it can be woven into their particular niches.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In this future, AI capabilities advance steadily along current trajectories, driven by incremental improvements rather than major breakthroughs. Efforts to regulate the technology are outweighed by productivity gains from humans leveraging AI. By 2030, domain-specific AI agents have achieved remarkable proficiency in operational functions across finance, HR, legal and other business areas. This evolution enables new organizational models featuring highly automated back offices and AI-augmented [...] What it means for CP companies: AI delivers — not explosively, but reliably. Agents drive greater productivity by autonomously handling routine tasks so that operations are scaled cost-effectively, while humans shift to higher-value roles in strategy and creativity. Consumers enjoy smarter personalization. The winners are companies that scale AI across the value chain from sourcing to service while still strategically leveraging the best of what humans can offer. [...] #### Key takeaway: AI underdelivers and humans remain central to value creation.\n\n#### Human to agent to automation ratio:&quot;,

At the same time, double down on AI’s role in augmenting human skills in elicitation and problem-solving — maximizing the positive [...] assistance — including skills in understanding issues, eliciting information and solving problems — remains central to customer expectations and the trust they have in service providers. Creating a more effective blend between chatbots and human agents, including the ability to detect signs of frustration and the inclusion of full context in chatbot-to-human handoff, is now mission critical. [...] GenAI is already gaining traction with consumers on the path to purchase and is potentially set to supersede other modes of enquiry and discovery.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How agentic AI solutions are structured - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI will reshape how work is coordinated across every function. Talent Acquisition is simply the first place where the pattern becomes painfully obvious. If leaders can learn to see the structure here, specialization, orchestration, documentation and continuous improvement, they can apply the same mental model across the enterprise. [...] To illustrate how this model decomposes hiring work into safe, auditable and repeatable micro-behaviors, the table below provides a representative Talent Acquisition Agentic Reference Table. Each agent focuses on a narrow slice of responsibility, reducing cognitive load on humans and improving cycle time, documentation completeness and compliance posture. [...] This article uses Talent Acquisition as a concrete example to demystify agentic AI, how orchestration layers route tasks, how sub-agents behave like discrete competencies and how continuous improvement cycles refine decisions rather than just automate steps. The goal is not to celebrate novelty; it is to map responsibility in a world where machines own outcomes, not just tasks. Agentic AI can reduce operational cost and risk, but only if leaders understand the architecture well enough to govern&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The agentic AI mindset: Redefining work from &#x27;how&#x27; to &#x27;what&#x27;&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By 2018, the process was much easier with digital tools like Google, LinkedIn and job boards, condensing weeks of work into hours. But while automation simplified each step, the work itself hadn’t changed: you were still responsible for research, production and distribution. Today, agentic AI changes that completely. You simply define your intent—what role you need, where and under what conditions—and the AI takes care of the rest: researching, producing, distributing and even identifying [...] And the change is happening fast. Agentic AI is top of mind for leadership, with companies working in overdrive to rethink workforce structures and develop new products that better support their customers. With so much promise, there’s a rush to unlock real business value, and for good reason. The companies that get it right will be the ones that win. The challenge now is to translate the promise of Agentic AI into practice and identify where it creates tangible value. [...] Managing an AI agent is like managing a team member: it requires clear goals, structured feedback and trust. For example, supply chain planners might instruct an AI to “optimize next quarter’s replenishment plan for cost and service,” while defining constraints such as supplier lead times or sustainability targets. The system executes, but people remain responsible for reviewing the results and refining the inputs.&quot;,

Salesforce aims to tackle this problem with the integration of its newest acquisition, Informatica.\n\n### Salesforce unveils observability tools to manage and optimize AI agents [...] March 5, 2025: Salesforce released the third version of its agentic AI offering — Agentforce 2dx — to simplify the development, testing, and deployment of AI agents that can automate business processes across departments, such as sales, service, marketing, finance, HR, and operations.\n\n### Salesforce’s AgentExchange targets AI agent adoption, monetization [...] April 17, 2025: AI agents are more than a productivity boost; they’re fundamentally reshaping customer interactions and business operations.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI agents for IT operations can bring a whole new level and quality of self-service, embedded in day-to-day tools and workflows. Agents can accelerate solutions requiring self-healing automations, allowing a broader range of system issues to be addressed without continuous human intervention. For critical and complex issues, AI agents assist the incident management process with diagnosis data, potential root cause and possible resolutions, enabling faster service restoration. [...] As IT operations evolve, organizations need systems that are not just reactive, but adaptive and resilient. By leveraging agentic AI and real-time insights, Cognizant’s AI-driven resilient IT Operations 3S model—Self-serve, Self-heal, Self-adapt—lays the foundation for resilient operations that scale with business needs.\n\nCognizant\n\n#### Self-serve\n\nAI-powered, end-user-facing agents autonomously resolve routine issues, enhancing productivity and delivering superior customer experience.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Companies across all sectors are slowly finding ways to exploit generative and agentic AI. As these successful exploitations become manifest, the result will be a shift in the way we work.\n\nStarting in 2028-2029, role redesign will be the priority. Gartner reports that AI will create more jobs than it eliminates, yet over 32 million roles will be transformed significantly each year. Every day, 150,000 jobs will evolve through upskilling, while 70,000 will be rewritten, reworked, or redesigned. [...] In this scenario, humans want AI to do the work. However, despite the hype surrounding emerging tech, work is not significantly transformed.\n\nWhile AI can complete a large proportion of the work, Poitevin said people fill in the gaps where AI can&#x27;t complete tasks effectively.\n\n\&quot;With AI, your tasks change slightly, or how you spend your time changes, but what you do overall as a professional in that space hasn&#x27;t changed substantially,\&quot; she said. [...] \&quot;Professionals who have career aspirations should be looking more towards transformation and how they can use AI to work better. They should be aiming to use AI to surpass frontiers of knowledge.\&quot;\n\n## Scenario 2: Fewer workers run an AI-first enterprise\n\nIn this scenario, AI autonomously handles part or the entirety of a business. In other words, AI replaces all, or all but a few, human workers.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Accelerate agentic AI-led transformation with a unified platform\n\nIn this environment, unified platforms become critical. Without them, enterprises risk a proliferation of disconnected agents working at cross-purposes. A unified approach provides the guardrails with shared knowledge graphs, consistent policy frameworks and a single orchestration layer that ensures interoperability across business functions. [...] Equally important is cultural trust. Employees must believe these systems are partners, not threats. This calls for change management, training, and communication that positions agentic AI as augmenting human capability rather than replacing it.\n\n### Measure business value early [...] Today, a new chapter is unfolding. Agentic AI, whose systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step orchestration, represents a significant evolution. These systems don’t just assist, they act. They evaluate context, weigh outcomes and autonomously initiate actions, orchestrating complex workflows across functions. They adapt dynamically and collaborate with other agents in ways that are beginning to reshape enterprise operations at large.&quot;,

[...] Langflow is a Python-based, open-source framework for building AI agents and other AI applications. Langflow was originally built on LangChain, its parent framework. LangGraph, another platform within the same family, is also used to build agentic systems by using graph-based architectures. What sets Langflow apart is its easy to use, drag-and-drop interface in which users can connect agent components to design personalized workflows or start with the prebuilt templates. As an alternative to [...] This tutorial has equipped you with the essential skills to leverage Langflow and watsonx Orchestrate for constructing robust, scalable, and enterprise-ready agents. You learned how to import agentic LangFlow flows as MCP servers by using watsonx Orchestrate as a Software as a Service (SaaS) along with IBM Cloud. Also, you are now familiar with how to import basic LangFlow flows when using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Development Kit (ADK) locally. By following the step-by-step&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Engine has since expanded beyond its initial cancellation use case. The company now operates multiple AI agents — including IT, HR, product, and finance assistants deployed through Slack — that Salvaggio collectively refers to as \&quot;multi-purpose admin\&quot; agents.\n\n## Williams-Sonoma is using AI agents to recreate the in-store shopping experience online [...] \&quot;The average enterprise-grade agentic team is 200-plus people working on an agentic platform,\&quot; Hinchcliffe said. \&quot;Salesforce has over 450 people working on agent AI.\&quot;\n\nEarly in the AI adoption cycle, many CIOs attempted to build their own agent platforms using open-source tools like LangChain. They quickly discovered the complexity exceeded their resources. [...] Hinchcliffe&#x27;s research found that only about half of the agentic AI platforms his firm evaluated included runtime trust verification — the practice of checking every transaction for policy compliance, data toxicity, and security violations as it happens, rather than relying solely on design-time constraints that can be circumvented.&quot;,

With agentic assistance holding even greater potential to collapse discovery, consideration and purchase as customers become more empowered, it is vital to reimagine your proposition in new ways, and in areas well upstream from the point of sale. Take care to ensure your products and services are differentiated, visible and easily understood by AI [...] While AI is playing a dynamic role in service discovery, its role within service portfolios and customer care systems is also beset by apprehension and anxiety among consumers. Prioritize effective education about the role that digital tools play in your customer interactions, understanding that human-centered support is still an overriding need for many end users. At the same time, double down on AI’s role in augmenting human skills in elicitation and problem-solving — maximizing the positive [...] assistance — including skills in understanding issues, eliciting information and solving problems — remains central to customer expectations and the trust they have in service providers. Creating a more effective blend between chatbots and human agents, including the ability to detect signs of frustration and the inclusion of full context in chatbot-to-human handoff, is now mission critical.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;From assistance to autonomy: How agentic AI is redefining ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When designed responsibly, agentic AI can deliver exponential improvements. A procurement cycle reduced from weeks to hours, or a compliance review automated at scale, can fundamentally alter enterprise performance.\n\n### Preparing for the future\n\nThe rise of agentic AI does not mean handing over control to machines or codes. Instead, it marks the next phase of enterprise transformation, where humans and agents operate side by side in orchestrated systems. [...] This shift from narrow support to autonomous orchestration is the defining leap of the next era of enterprise AI. It is not about replacing humans but about embedding intelligence into the very fabric of organizational workflows.\n\n### Rethink enterprise workflows [...] For leaders, this shift carries both opportunity and responsibility. The potential is immense, but so are the governance, trust and design challenges that come with giving AI systems greater autonomy. Enterprises must be able to monitor and override any actions taken by the agentic AI systems.\n\n### Shift from assistance to autonomy&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Private Equity Is Accelerating Exit Readiness&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is what defines an Agentic Enterprise in practice, where humans and AI operate side by side, with agents handling repeatable tasks, enforcing rules, and surfacing next-best actions in real time. The result is faster execution, higher productivity, and more consistent customer experiences without adding headcount.\n\nBy prioritizing operational AI over broad pilots, companies create durable performance gains that show up in EBITDA and exit readiness well before a sale process begins. [...] When sales, finance, and legal are disconnected, the customer feels the pain. Learn how Agentforce Revenue Management can help.\n\nWatch the demo\n\nBut the biggest unlock comes from organizing people and data in a way that makes clean operations repeatable. Leading companies centralize data ownership, align definitions across teams, and treat AI-driven workflows as part of the extended workforce—measured, monitored, and continuously improved. [...] That context is delivered at the last mile, directly into the flow of work, so employees and AI can act on trusted information. With shared definitions, governed metadata, and embedded controls, teams operate from a consistent source of truth.\n\nThe result is more accurate forecasting, reduced revenue leakage, and faster board- and buyer-ready reporting, with governance and compliance embedded into daily execution.\n\n### 3.

[...] Scaling with Agent Fleets: OCI’s Vision and Best Practices\n\nAs generative AI evolves from individual productivity tools to autonomous operations,we’re entering the era of agent fleets, or coordinated groups of specialized AI agents working together to tackle complex, high-volume tasks.\n\nTo understand how agent fleets build on simpler approaches, consider this progression:\n\n   Single agentsexcel in focused domains, like an HR assistant answering policy questions within a portal.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The question for enterprises is no longer whether AI agents will transform customer and employee experiences. The data from Salesforce&#x27;s customer base suggests that transformation is already underway, generating measurable returns for early adopters willing to invest in platform infrastructure rather than waiting for a theoretical bubble to burst. [...] \&quot;Companies need to start building AI expertise into their employee base,\&quot; Salvaggio said. \&quot;You can&#x27;t outsource all of this — you need that institutional knowledge within your organization.\&quot;\n\nThattai struck a similarly forward-looking note, drawing parallels to previous platform shifts.

This was apparent in coverage of organizations across sectors using Agentforce to create new capabilities, revenue streams, and ways of working: [...] ## Let’s Talk: How Conversation Design Enables the Agentic Enterprise\n\n10 min read\n\n## Salesforce Opens Agentforce 360 to Power a New Generation of AI-Native Partner-Built Companies\n\n6 min read\n\n### Build and customize autonomous AI agents to support your employees and customers 24/7.\n\nDiscover Agentforce\n\n## Explore related content by topic\n\n Agentic Enterprise\n Agents\n AI\n Data\n\n## Related Articles\n\n## DeVry University Transforms Adult Learner Support with Agentforce 360\n\n3 min read [...] The human-AI partnership was also apparent in Salesforce’s reporting on its own Agentforce adoption.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All of this work is anchored by documentation in the electronic medical record. Every specialist records what they did, why they did it and what changed. Not because someone asked for paperwork, but because a shared record prevents mistakes, supports compliance and keeps the entire care team aligned. In agentic AI, every sub-agent logs activity into the applicant tracking system, the HR information system and the audit trail. The organization can see what happened, when it happened and who made [...] | Agent Name | Purpose | Typical Actions | Risk / Value Contribution |\n ---  --- |\n| Candidate Sourcing Agent | Finds qualified candidates based on role criteria | Searches job boards, talent pools, internal mobility databases | Reduces time-to-pipeline, improves quality of slate |\n| Resume Screening Agent | Evaluates experience and skills | Performs structured scoring, flags gaps | Improves consistency, reduces bias risk | [...] The moment you see Talent Acquisition as a high-volume care pathway, full of decision uncertainty, compliance risk and timing pressure, the value of specialization becomes obvious. A single recruiter juggling all of these responsibilities is not a hero. They are a bottleneck. Agentic AI gently pries those responsibilities apart, assigning each one to a specialist that never forgets, never tires and always documents.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Artificial intelligence (AI) puts a vast and tireless intelligence at our service, creating high hopes that AI can fuel economic growth and open the door to greater shared prosperity.\n\nOur experience at PwC indicates that these hopes may be fulfilled. We’re finding that AI can drive a revolution in value creation that is good for organizations, good for workers and good for the economy. [...] Artificial intelligence (AI) transforms companies’ ability to apply intelligence, creating opportunities for innovative business models and new value pools.\n Recent research by PwC suggests that these benefits do not come at the expense of jobs.\n The responsibility for developing much-needed AI skills should be shared by organizations, policy-makers, educators and employees themselves. [...] A new report from PwC and the World Economic Forum, Leveraging generative AI for job augmentation and workforce productivity, offers a critical insight: it depends as much or more on people as on the technology itself.&quot;,

Agents can handle the administrative load without requiring constant oversight, which allows HR professionals to focus on more complex, human-centric responsibilities like coaching, retention, and culture. In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them. [...] In a world where workforce needs change quickly, HR leaders need better tools to see around corners. Agentic systems can continuously pull data from HRIS, finance, and operations tools to maintain real-time models of workforce supply and demand. [...] Agentic AI for HR fills the gap. It can interpret nuance, make decisions dynamically, and take initiative across multi-step processes, offloading the complexity that BPA wasn’t built to handle. For example: Agents can identify when a benefits request doesn’t follow the usual path or when a policy requires clarification and either make the adjustment itself or flag the issue to a human to handle it.\n\nSome of the areas where HR agents are already providing essential support:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the _McKinsey Talks Talent_ podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock:In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When deployed properly, AI agents open up capacity for HR teams to be more strategic and build better relationships. Agents can handle the administrative load without requiring constant oversight, which allows HR professionals to focus on more complex, human-centric responsibilities like coaching, retention, and culture. In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them. [...] Agentic AI for HR fills the gap. It can interpret nuance, make decisions dynamically, and take initiative across multi-step processes, offloading the complexity that BPA wasn’t built to handle. For example: Agents can identify when a benefits request doesn’t follow the usual path or when a policy requires clarification and either make the adjustment itself or flag the issue to a human to handle it.\n\nSome of the areas where HR agents are already providing essential support: [...] In a world where workforce needs change quickly, HR leaders need better tools to see around corners. Agentic systems can continuously pull data from HRIS, finance, and operations tools to maintain real-time models of workforce supply and demand.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Despite slow take-up in HR and mixed reports about the return on investment (ROI), global executives see AI as the top business priority and the biggest potential value driver in 2025. Agentic AI is transforming company systems, processes and the workforce, and HR leaders who don’t prepare will be left behind. [...] Let’s be clear: The human and digital parts of our workforce are not the same. IT will certainly handle the more technical, tactical side of agent adoption and management. But in a climate of cyber risk, cost optimization and skills shortages, the rise of agentic AI poses new challenges and opportunities for HR to consider.\n\n### [...] The true power of agentic AI isn’t just in automation; it’s in augmentation. While other types of AI are excellent tools for specific tasks, agentic AI is uniquely suited to augment the workforce more broadly. Agents can mimic human reasoning, interactions and decision-making to effectively work alongside human employees, rather than just supporting them. When we blend human creativity with AI’s analytical capabilities, we create a workforce that’s greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Despite slow take-up in HR and mixed reports about the return on investment (ROI), global executives see AI as the top business priority and the biggest potential value driver in 2025. Agentic AI is transforming company systems, processes and the workforce, and HR leaders who don’t prepare will be left behind. [...] The true power of agentic AI isn’t just in automation; it’s in augmentation. While other types of AI are excellent tools for specific tasks, agentic AI is uniquely suited to augment the workforce more broadly. Agents can mimic human reasoning, interactions and decision-making to effectively work alongside human employees, rather than just supporting them. When we blend human creativity with AI’s analytical capabilities, we create a workforce that’s greater than the sum of its parts. [...] Let’s be clear: The human and digital parts of our workforce are not the same. IT will certainly handle the more technical, tactical side of agent adoption and management. But in a climate of cyber risk, cost optimization and skills shortages, the rise of agentic AI poses new challenges and opportunities for HR to consider.\n\n###&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the _McKinsey Talks Talent_ podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock:In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How agentic AI solutions are structured - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All of this work is anchored by documentation in the electronic medical record. Every specialist records what they did, why they did it and what changed. Not because someone asked for paperwork, but because a shared record prevents mistakes, supports compliance and keeps the entire care team aligned. In agentic AI, every sub-agent logs activity into the applicant tracking system, the HR information system and the audit trail. The organization can see what happened, when it happened and who made [...] The moment you see Talent Acquisition as a high-volume care pathway, full of decision uncertainty, compliance risk and timing pressure, the value of specialization becomes obvious. A single recruiter juggling all of these responsibilities is not a hero. They are a bottleneck. Agentic AI gently pries those responsibilities apart, assigning each one to a specialist that never forgets, never tires and always documents. [...] | Agent Name | Purpose | Typical Actions | Risk / Value Contribution |\n ---  --- |\n| Candidate Sourcing Agent | Finds qualified candidates based on role criteria | Searches job boards, talent pools, internal mobility databases | Reduces time-to-pipeline, improves quality of slate |\n| Resume Screening Agent | Evaluates experience and skills | Performs structured scoring, flags gaps | Improves consistency, reduces bias risk |&quot;,
