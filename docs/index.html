  <li><strong>Synthesia Raises $200M to Advance AI-Driven Workforce Skills Using Avatars (2026-01-26)</strong><br>
    Synthesia’s $200 million funding round at a $4 billion valuation represents a defining moment in the evolution of AI-powered workforce upskilling. The platform’s use of generative AI avatars to deliver scalable, immersive training addresses increasing client demand for personalized, high-throughput learning. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/26/synthesia-raises-200m-4b-valuation-build-worker-skills-using-ai-avatars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>New AI Coordination Models Aim to Transform Enterprise Collaboration (2026-01-25)</strong><br>
    Humans& is advancing research and tooling for enterprise-scale multi-agent coordination. Their work highlights the strategic shift towards orchestrated AI agents that collaborate to deliver complex workflows rather than isolated point solutions. Workday and Deloitte must monitor these developments to guide client integration and multi-agent governance strategies. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/humans-thinks-coordination-is-the-next-frontier-for-ai-and-theyre-building-a-model-to-prove-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full article</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise Technology Predictions for 2026: Agentic AI and Best-of-Breed Ecosystems Rise (2026-01-25)</strong><br>
    SiliconANGLE forecasts a mainstream shift to composable, agentic architectures in enterprise SaaS. Workday’s push for open skills clouds and extensibility faces mounting competition from best-of-breed vendors. Deloitte must help clients navigate hybrid SaaS landscapes, orchestrating Workday with new AI-driven services. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/25/enterprise-technology-predictions-whats-coming-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the predictions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Synthesia</strong>: Raised $200M to scale AI-powered upskilling; expected to fuel innovation in dynamic learning content, directly competing with Workday’s Skills Cloud. <em>Implication:</em> Deloitte should expect increased benchmarking requests and must articulate Workday’s differentiators for skills intelligence and integration depth. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/26/synthesia-raises-200m-4b-valuation-build-worker-skills-using-ai-avatars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Humans& (Agent Coordination)</strong>: Announced progress in multi-agent orchestration, raising client expectations for enterprise-scale, composable automation. <em>Implication:</em> Accelerates the need for Workday and Deloitte to offer robust, governable agentic AI workflows. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/humans-thinks-coordination-is-the-next-frontier-for-ai-and-theyre-building-a-model-to-prove-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Vendor Ecosystem</strong>: Best-of-breed agentic and skills tools are proliferating, supported by analyst forecasts of greater platform composability. <em>Implication:</em> Deloitte must rapidly build capability in multi-cloud and multi-agent orchestration for Workday clients. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/25/enterprise-technology-predictions-whats-coming-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li>

The latest rounds of funding for ecosystem players and new research on multi-agent systems signal rapid pace and heightened competitive pressure for Workday and its partners.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Synthesia Raises $200M to Advance AI-Driven Workforce Skills Using Avatars (2026-01-26)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Synthesia’s $200 million funding round, yielding a $4 billion valuation, marks a new era of AI-powered upskilling and training platforms. The company deploys AI-generated avatars to help enterprises reskill or upskill employees, blending immersive video with automated content creation. This move underscores escalating demand for scalable, customizable workforce development tools leveraging generative AI. For Workday and its Skills Cloud proposition, Synthesia’s trajectory is both a competitive signal and an invitation for deeper specialization or partnership. The injection of capital will allow Synthesia to accelerate R&amp;D, expand integration with HCM and learning systems, and potentially challenge incumbents like Workday, SAP, and Oracle that already embed skills intelligence into core suites. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, Synthesia’s funding introduces a rising player in the ecosystem that clients may increasingly mention—especially those seeking novel ways to accelerate upskilling, handle distributed teams, or modernize learning pipelines. The impact will manifest both in enhanced client expectations around AI-driven talent development, and in IT decision-makers exploring how to integrate such advanced AI content into their Workday environments. Deloitte’s ability to provide an informed, comparative perspective on such emerging vendors—and architect integrations or value-add solutions—will likely become a point of differentiation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/26/synthesia-raises-200m-4b-valuation-build-worker-skills-using-ai-avatars\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;New AI Coordination Models Aim to Transform Enterprise Collaboration (2026-01-25)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Humans&amp;, a startup specializing in AI agent coordination, announced its latest research and product direction, focusing on multi-agent orchestration as the &#x27;next frontier&#x27; for enterprise automation. The company argues that, while current AI agents demonstrate strong single-task performance, real business value comes from orchestrated, autonomous agents handling complex, interdependent workflows. This reflects wider trends in agentic AI, where enterprise adoption is shifting toward agent-based business workflows (as seen in newer Workday, Oracle, and ServiceNow automation modules). For Workday, which has already piloted autonomous AI in HR operations and document processing, the maturation of agentic orchestration elsewhere is a competitive and technical inflection point. The company’s ability to create composable, trusted multi-agent systems—integrated into its AI Marketplace and Extend platform—may determine whether Workday leads or falls behind in agentic automation. For Deloitte, this development compels advisory teams to understand inter-agent communication protocols, as well as governance, security, and trust frameworks for orchestrated AI. Client conversations will increasingly shift from point-solution automation to robust, multi-agent architectures, requiring change management and IT readiness.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/humans-thinks-coordination-is-the-next-frontier-for-ai-and-theyre-building-a-model-to-prove-it\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Enterprise Technology Predictions for 2026: Agentic AI and Best-of-Breed Ecosystems Rise (2026-01-25)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SiliconANGLE’s annual tech outlook confirms that agentic AI tools, composability, and skills-based HR practices will be mainstream in 2026. Industry experts predict enterprises will prefer best-of-breed add-ons integrated with foundation platforms like Workday, rather than one-size-fits-all suites. AI-driven skills mapping, talent mobility engines, and agentic process automation are singled out for their transformative impact on productivity and employee experience. For Workday, this signals both validation (as skills intelligence and agentic extensibility are marquee features) and a competitive challenge, as hyperscalers and specialist vendors keep innovating. Deloitte’s Workday teams should expect client interest in more agile, composable architectures, demanding orchestrated AI, and higher standards for integration and data governance. Strategic advisory now requires holistic knowledge across SaaS, platform APIs, AI governance, and ecosystem vendor roadmaps.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/25/enterprise-technology-predictions-whats-coming-2026\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Synthesia\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Secured $200M funding at a $4B valuation to scale its AI-powered workforce upskilling platform utilizing video avatars.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Synthesia’s expansion will test Workday’s ability to maintain leadership in skills-focused talent development.
