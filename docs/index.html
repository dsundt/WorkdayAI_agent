  <li><strong>New Benchmarks Question Workplace Readiness of AI Agents (Jan 22, 2026)</strong><br/><p>A new benchmark study has raised important concerns about the maturity and reliability of agentic AI in enterprise contexts. The report finds that despite recent investment and excitement, current agentic tools still underperform in areas critical for SaaS HCM and Finance solutions, such as autonomous orchestration, end-to-end contextual understanding, and handling of complex edge cases. This suggests that while products like Workday Extend and offerings found in the Workday AI Marketplace can accelerate innovation, deployment should be carefully staged to avoid overpromising outcomes. For Deloitte’s Workday teams and their clients, these insights are a call to strengthen pilot approaches, invest in staff enablement, and clearly communicate both the opportunities and present limitations of agentic solutions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/are-ai-agents-ready-for-the-workplace-a-new-benchmark-raises-doubts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View source</a>.</p></li>
  <li><strong>SaaS Integration Threats Rise as Agentic AI Scales (Jan 22, 2026)</strong><br/><p>New coverage focuses on rising cybersecurity risks as organizations ramp up automation and app-to-app integrations within platforms such as Workday. Agentic AI accelerates process innovation but also exposes organizations to new vectors for attack—especially where low-code connectors, APIs, and autonomous agents are involved. IT leaders and partners are urged to implement robust governance and third-party security reviews. Deloitte’s dual expertise in AI and cyber is now central to Workday delivery, requiring integrated playbooks and a zero-trust posture for agentic environments. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/22/obsidian-security-targets-rising-tide-saas-integration-threats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View source</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP SuccessFactors</strong>: SAP introduces enhanced Business AI for SuccessFactors HCM, offering more embedded, context-aware intelligence directly in HR workflows. This increases competitive intensity in the AI-for-HCM space, pushing Workday and consulting partners to articulate unique approaches to responsible AI and open extensibility through tools like Workday Extend. <a href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/introducing-sap-business-ai-for-sap-successfactors-hcm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View source</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle Cloud</strong>: European enterprises accelerate their AI journey by leveraging Oracle Cloud’s compliance-focused solutions. This puts pressure on Workday to reinforce its auditability and trust advantages for regulated industries and to communicate security differentiation proactively. <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601230400BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260123_BW897270-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View source</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI Deployment Patterns: Benchmarks and Best Practices</strong>: Equip project teams to discern between leading and lagging AI reliability, support clients in pragmatic pilots, and help set realistic scaling timelines. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/are-ai-agents-ready-for-the-workplace-a-new-benchmark-raises-doubts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Securing SaaS and Agentic Integrations</strong>: Train consultants on best practices for securing low-code and agentic connectors, with concrete action steps for Workday-centric solutions. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/22/obsidian-security-targets-rising-tide-saas-integration-threats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update client and internal briefings to reflect the latest agentic AI benchmarks and deploy cautionary guidance in all discovery sessions.</li>
  <li>Review end-to-end integration security controls and training with a focus on agent-driven connectors and automations.</li>
  <li>Hold cross-team workshops on risk, readiness, and pilot evaluation criteria for agentic AI in the Workday context.</li>
  <li>Monitor competitive AI launches from SAP SuccessFactors and Oracle Cloud; update Deloitte materials to position Workday’s differentiation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Overestimation of agentic AI leads to failed projects and eroded client trust. <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Enforce pilot-first implementations; calibrate expectations for autonomy; upskill all teams on maturity limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Increased SaaS integration threats drive data loss and compliance issues. <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Embed continuous monitoring, security assessments, and third-party reviews into all integration projects.</li>
</ul>

The coverage notes that while agentic AI solutions continue to proliferate, many still fall short on key readiness measures, particularly in areas like autonomous workflow orchestration, contextual reasoning, and reliability under complex business scenarios. The findings raise questions about actual return on investment versus the hype cycle for advanced AI in SaaS, including platforms like Workday. \\n\\nStrategically, this suggests that enterprises—including those leveraging Workday Extend or emerging agentic AI capabilities through the Workday AI Marketplace—should be cautious in positioning agents as fully autonomous, especially in critical HR and finance functions. Workday’s consulting partners, such as Deloitte, must therefore calibrate client expectations, emphasize robust pilot programs, and invest in upskilling on responsible integration patterns. \\n\\nFor Workday’s ecosystem, the report amplifies a broader risk: that client organizations may experience implementation frustrations if agentic AI is overpromised or underspecified, potentially threatening adoption rates and credibility for both Workday itself and leading GSIs. Deloitte teams should leverage these insights to advocate pragmatic, staged AI rollouts and to differentiate by providing nuanced guidance on where current agentic tools deliver value—and where human oversight remains essential. \\n\\nSee: https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/are-ai-agents-ready-for-the-workplace-a-new-benchmark-raises-doubts\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/are-ai-agents-ready-for-the-workplace-a-new-benchmark-raises-doubts\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SaaS Integration Threats Rise as Agentic AI Scales (Jan 22, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new security analysis, published January 22, 2026, highlights the rising risks associated with SaaS integrations as enterprises push toward hyper-automation and agent-driven workflows. The article focuses on the emerging ‘integrations threat surface’ as platforms like Workday become pivotal hubs for workflow automation and inter-application orchestration. Notable is the specific mention of how integration platforms—even those positioned as low-code/agentic accelerators—have become prime targets for sophisticated attacks due to expanded API access and privileged data movement. \\n\\nFrom a technical and strategic perspective, this points to an urgent requirement for hardened integration governance across the Workday stack, particularly for clients adopting third-party agentic AI connectors or leveraging the Workday Extend toolkit. Deloitte’s Workday practice should address the implications for IT security, compliance, and risk management, especially in the context of M&amp;A or multi-tenant deployments in highly regulated industries. \\n\\nClients must revisit vendor risk frameworks and consider investing in continuous monitoring and third-party audits not just for Workday core, but for the entire constellation of agentic AI-enabled connectors. Deloitte can differentiate by embedding cybersecurity expertise into all Workday AI deployment conversations and by articulating clear playbooks for integration hardening and incident response. \\n\\nSee: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/22/obsidian-security-targets-rising-tide-saas-integration-threats\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/22/obsidian-security-targets-rising-tide-saas-integration-threats\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP SuccessFactors\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP is advancing its AI footprint in HCM with the integration of SAP Business AI for SuccessFactors HCM, focusing on embedded, context-aware assistance and deeper process automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s move doubles down on native AI-as-a-service within core HCM, narrowing the differentiation gap with Workday in terms of intelligent workflows and personalized guidance. This increases competitive pressure on Workday—especially as clients demand both flexibility and trustworthy, explainable automation. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, it’s critical to position Workday’s AI strategy as both open and robust—leveraging Workday Extend and AI Marketplace while providing objective assessments of what ‘responsible AI’ looks like in real deployments. \\n\\nSource: https://learning.sap.com/courses/introducing-sap-business-ai-for-sap-successfactors-hcm\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Cloud\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;European enterprises are moving workloads to Oracle Cloud to accelerate AI-driven transformation, with emphasis on compliance and industry-specific controls.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s traction with compliance-driven AI deployments challenges Workday, which historically leads on security and trust, especially in regulated industries.

The report finds that despite recent investment and excitement, current agentic tools still underperform in areas critical for SaaS HCM and Finance solutions, such as autonomous orchestration, end-to-end contextual understanding, and handling of complex edge cases. This suggests that while products like Workday Extend and offerings found in the Workday AI Marketplace can accelerate innovation, deployment should be carefully staged to avoid overpromising outcomes. For Deloitte’s Workday teams and their clients, these insights are a call to strengthen pilot approaches, invest in staff enablement, and clearly communicate both the opportunities and present limitations of agentic solutions. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/are-ai-agents-ready-for-the-workplace-a-new-benchmark-raises-doubts\\\&quot;&gt;View source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS Integration Threats Rise as Agentic AI Scales (Jan 22, 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;New coverage focuses on rising cybersecurity risks as organizations ramp up automation and app-to-app integrations within platforms such as Workday. Agentic AI accelerates process innovation but also exposes organizations to new vectors for attack—especially where low-code connectors, APIs, and autonomous agents are involved. IT leaders and partners are urged to implement robust governance and third-party security reviews. Deloitte’s dual expertise in AI and cyber is now central to Workday delivery, requiring integrated playbooks and a zero-trust posture for agentic environments. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/22/obsidian-security-targets-rising-tide-saas-integration-threats\\\&quot;&gt;View source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/strong&gt;: SAP introduces enhanced Business AI for SuccessFactors HCM, offering more embedded, context-aware intelligence directly in HR workflows.

[...] AI agents need the right context to perform complex tasks accurately. Built on Elasticsearch, Agent Builder excels at context engineering by delivering relevance in a unified platform that scales, searches, and analyzes enterprise data. It dramatically simplifies the entire agent workflow with native data prep and ingestion, retrieval and ranking, built-in and custom tools, native conversational experience, and agent observability. Developers can use Agent Builder to chat with their data or build a context-driven custom agent in minutes. [...] Many agent-building frameworks require LLMs to plan and manage every step of the automation. However, AI lacks the reliability of rule-based actions, a critical capability for organizations. Workflows closes this gap. Now, agents built with Agent Builder can leverage Workflows to orchestrate internal and external systems to take actions, gather and transform data and context with precision. Agent Builder and Workflows enable developers to build context-driven agents that can reason accurately and execute predictably.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;European Enterprises Adopt Oracle Cloud for Push into AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Oracle’s delivery of AI as a built-in capability of its core applications, rather than an add-on feature, has created new ways for service providers to add value, ISG says. By embedding AI agents into Oracle Fusion Applications as part of the base subscription, Oracle helps organizations move AI from pilots to everyday business use. In response, providers are developing proprietary, industry-specific AI agents for Fusion Applications, offering them through Oracle’s AI Agent Marketplace and differentiating themselves with deep domain expertise rather than basic AI implementation skills. [...] # Company Announcements\n\n### European Enterprises Adopt Oracle Cloud for Push into AI\n\nMulticloud interoperability, EU sovereignty compliance, AI adoption dominate enterprise cloud strategies in Europe, ISG Provider Lens® report says\n\nLONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2026--\nEuropean enterprises are increasingly adopting Oracle cloud environments, especially with partners that can advise on and deliver monetizable, AI-driven solutions, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a global AI-centered technology research and advisory firm. [...] “The European Oracle ecosystem has reached a critical turning point as AI, multicloud and sovereignty converge,” said Roman Pelzel, principal analyst, ISG Provider Lens Research, and lead author of the report. “Enterprises and partners that move quickly can build differentiated capabilities, secure compliant architectures and gain a lasting competitive edge.”\n\nThe report also explores other trends in Oracle cloud adoption in Europe, including growing AI skills gaps between Oracle partners and rising pressure on providers to build higher-value managed services to sustain profitability.\n\nFor more insights into Oracle cloud-related challenges facing European enterprises, plus ISG’s advice for addressing them, see the ISG Provider Lens® Focal Points briefing here.&quot;,

So, for example, instead of keeping data private because this agrees with a rule, the constitution will help it understand the ethical framework in which privacy is important.\n\nThe effect of this added complexity is length, with the new version expanding dramatically to 84 pages and 23,000 words. If this sounds long-winded, the reasoning is that the document has been written to be ingested primarily by Claude itself. “It [the constitution] needs to work both as a statement of abstract ideals _and_ a useful artifact for training,” the announcement said.

You can use this type of automation to automate highly repetitive\ntasks.\n\nFor example, Report generation. In this use case, the reports are automatically generated and distributed to relevant stakeholders.\n\nUnattended automation offer significant efficiency gains, reduced operational costs, and improved accuracy in organizations.\n\nAlso known as human-assisted automation. In this automation, the robots work alongside human users to augment their tasks and activities. You can use this type of automation with human supervision. [...] For example, Customer service. In this use case, robots can assist customer service representatives by providing relevant information, suggesting responses, and automating data entry. The robots are installed on\noperator’s workstations and are triggered by human operators on demand.\n\nAttended automation is often suited for scenarios where a combination of automation and human judgment is required to handle complex, dynamic, or non-standard tasks.\n\n## Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Hub users\n\nTable 1.

AI powered systems can analyse vast amounts of data in real-time to identify anomalies, predict potential threats and automate responses. The same technology can be weaponised by malicious actors to develop sophisticated phishing attacks, exploit vulnerabilities and evade detection. The NCSC says that AI will “almost certainly pose cyber resilience challenges to 2027 and beyond across critical systems and economy and society” and recent Deloitte research shows that in a recent annual report, 49% of the FTSE 100 identified an emerging risk relating to AI. Most of these emerging risks were linked to cyber security.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Artificial intelligence and digital technology: The use of AI in health care is still in its early stages, but some life sciences companies have moved beyond pilot projects and are scaling use cases. Among medtech companies, for example, generative AI could translate to cost efficiencies of between 6% and 12% of total revenue over the next two to three years, according to Deloitte estimates (see AI readiness in medtech). Some biopharmaceutical companies are combining AI with robotics and cloud computing to accelerate time-to-market while reducing errors and deviations and improving compliance and testing timelines (see Pharma&#x27;s QC lab of the future and The future of pharma&#x27;s commercial model). On the health care side, some early adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions [...] adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions in diagnostic errors, optimized treatment paths, and streamlined operations (see Health systems look to scale AI beyond the pilot phase). However, only about one-third of surveyed health care executives said their organizations are leveraging AI at scale. Moreover, fewer than half of them said they regularly assess the technology’s impact on the consumer experience, workforce productivity, or brand reputation. This disconnect between what is measured today and the full spectrum of technology’s value is what we call the “tech value gap” (see Considerations for health systems to help bridge the tech value gap). [...] What to watch in 2026: The traditional health care system, which is grounded in episodic and reactive care, might not be sustainable. While consumers are taking more control over their health care decisions, fewer than one-third of health care organizations are using AI at scale to support those customers. That could start to change this year. Some organizations are turning to generative and agentic AI to build trust and loyalty by helping patients stay on track with prescribed treatments, potentially signaling a new era of tech-enabled consumer support (see Agentic AI could transform treatment of chronic conditions). This year, more than half of surveyed health plan executives said they intend to invest in initiatives that expand the use of digital tools for member engagement and&quot;,

Famously, he did not receive plaudits within Microsoft for his pains. He was instead demoted. Years later, he revealed his profound embarrassment at the move. However, he persevered and PowerShell eventually launched in 2006, becoming the essential administrative tool it is today.\n\nMemorably, a number of Microsoft executives quietly told Snover \&quot;we were rooting for you\&quot; as he seemingly banged his head against the Redmond wall during his time in the wilderness.\n\n\&quot;If you ever were rooting for somebody,\&quot; said Snover dryly, \&quot;please do him a favor and go tell him.

One, \&quot;Coloring book,\&quot; is an AI feature that turns the user&#x27;s text into a coloring book page (we can&#x27;t imagine it being used to produce a picture of \&quot;a user faced with relentless AI slop\&quot; for a crayon-wielding toddler to improve). The other is a tolerance slider for the fill tool.\n\nThe Coloring book option applies only to Copilot+ PCs and requires a user to sign in with a Microsoft account.\n\nBoth Notepad and Paint have evolved far beyond their simple origins, but in doing so, have become intermediate tools that leave behind users who just want to edit text or flip a few pixels without add-ons getting in the way.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence technology, we are extending our UKG Bryte Generative AI capabilities by developing AI agents that can understand and respond to customer needs in real-time, handling a broad array of tasks, from data analysis, to workflow automation, and customer support,” said Hugo Sarrazin, president, chief product and technology officer at UKG. “Our Bryte AI Agents will work alongside employees and managers, particularly those in frontline roles, taking on tasks that are best suited for technology. This allows people to focus on the aspects of their jobs that have the biggest impact on their organizations.” [...] “In HR and operations, the opportunity for agentic AI is everywhere. There are hundreds of time-consuming checklist-driven tasks and processes that are difficult to automate because steps have multiple paths or require independent judgement,” said Josh Bersin, founder, CEO, and global industry analyst at The Josh Bersin Company. “The UKG connected AI agents have the potential to reduce this workload tremendously, liberating HR teams to focus on building a great workplace experience.” [...] With a commitment to responsible and ethical AI utilization, UKG’s connected agents will allow the organization to determine which tasks can be completed autonomously while ensuring there are built-in checkpoints that require people to review and accept. UKG Bryte is trained on the world’s largest collection of people data, work data, and culture data, including three decades of proprietary benchmarks and best practices from Great Place To Work, a UKG company.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech Trend #2: Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Perhaps the most significant change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor - a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии. [...] Разривът между обещание и реалност: Как да се преодолее?\n\nОрганизациите бързо започват да проучват възможностите на агентния AI, като Gartner прогнозира, че до 2028 г. около 15% от ежедневните работни решения ще се вземат автономно от такива системи - значителен ръст в сравнение с почти нулeв дял през 2024 г. Въпреки този напредък много организации се сблъскват със сериозни трудности, когато трябва да превърнат пилотните проекти в решения готови за реална употреба. Според проучването Deloitte 2025 Emerging Technology Trends едва 14% от организациите разполагат с решения, които могат да бъдат внедрени, а само 11% вече използват тези системи в продукционна среда.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human–AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the original article on the Deloitte Insights website.\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\n#### Thanks for your feedback&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What to watch in 2026: This could be the year that a majority of LSHC organizations move beyond piloting AI and begin system-wide integration. Achieving AI maturity remains aspirational for most organizations, but that appears to be changing. Nearly half of surveyed life sciences executives identified accelerated digital transformation as a trend that is likely to have a substantial impact on their organizations in 2026—a statistically significant increase compared with 2025. Biopharma and medtech leaders generally anticipate that AI will help boost organizational efficiency this year, and most expect it will play a central role in driving major change. [...] adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions in diagnostic errors, optimized treatment paths, and streamlined operations (see Health systems look to scale AI beyond the pilot phase). However, only about one-third of surveyed health care executives said their organizations are leveraging AI at scale. Moreover, fewer than half of them said they regularly assess the technology’s impact on the consumer experience, workforce productivity, or brand reputation. This disconnect between what is measured today and the full spectrum of technology’s value is what we call the “tech value gap” (see Considerations for health systems to help bridge the tech value gap). [...] Artificial intelligence and digital technology: The use of AI in health care is still in its early stages, but some life sciences companies have moved beyond pilot projects and are scaling use cases. Among medtech companies, for example, generative AI could translate to cost efficiencies of between 6% and 12% of total revenue over the next two to three years, according to Deloitte estimates (see AI readiness in medtech). Some biopharmaceutical companies are combining AI with robotics and cloud computing to accelerate time-to-market while reducing errors and deviations and improving compliance and testing timelines (see Pharma&#x27;s QC lab of the future and The future of pharma&#x27;s commercial model). On the health care side, some early adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions&quot;,

It involves establishing clear AI governance policies, identifying and mitigating AI-related risks across operational, ethical and technical domains and implementing robust controls to ensure AI systems operate within defined parameters while meeting business objectives and regulatory requirements. For directors, this means ensuring that the organisation has the right structures, policies and accountabilities in place to manage AI effectively. | [...] #### Key questions to ask your management team\n\nEnterprise controls: Is our organisation set up to manage our AI transformation with the right governance arrangements, including roles and responsibilities, policies and risk-based systems for managing AI risks? Do we have the right touchpoints throughout the AI lifecycle and robust response plans for incidents? What needs to be added or amended?\n\nCompliance: Do we understand the range of regulations and laws that apply to each of our AI use cases and are we confident that we are compliant? Have we considered expected future changes to regulatory requirements? Are we linked into industry bodies that will enable us to keep track of emerging trends? [...] | Technical foundations | Model: This involves testing data quality/bias, model performance, accuracy, bias detection and robustness to ensure reliable outputs and optimised decision-making capabilities.  Platform &amp; Infrastructure: This examines the security posture of AI systems, evaluating data protection measures, system vulnerabilities, architectural resilience against cyber threats and third-party provider considerations.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.” [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human–AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the original article on the Deloitte Insights website.\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\n#### Thanks for your feedback&quot;,

The company said such integrations, while valuable for automation and efficiency, have become a growing target for attackers exploiting blind spots in traditional security tools. [...] Founded by tech visionaries John Furrier and Dave Vellante, SiliconANGLE Media has built a dynamic ecosystem of industry-leading digital media brands that reach 15+ million elite tech professionals. Our new proprietary theCUBE AI Video Cloud is breaking ground in audience interaction, leveraging theCUBEai.com neural network to help technology companies make data-driven decisions and stay at the forefront of industry conversations.\n\n##### LATEST STORIES\n\nKeyfactor and IBM Consulting launch joint solution to accelerate post-quantum cryptography readiness\n\nSkeleton Key attack shows how hackers are bypassing malware defenses using legitimate software\n\nYuki launches with $6M in funding to help businesses manage spiraling AI data costs [...] ### Real-time detection and response\n\nThe new capabilities focus on three areas: visibility into SaaS-to-SaaS integration risks, early breach detection and rapid incident containment. Obsidian leverages a knowledge graph of usage patterns gathered from hundreds of customers to normalize identity and activity data across human and nonhuman users in various SaaS environments.\n\n“We correlate and normalize identity across all SaaS applications,” said Chief Executive Hasan Imam (pictured). “If you understand that the Hasan in Salesforce is the same as the Hasan in Workday, you can baseline Hasan across platforms.”&quot;,

[...] ## Intelligence and adaptability\n\nAgentic AI-based test automation brings intelligence and adaptability to omnichannel retail systems by autonomously identifying, executing, and improving test scenarios across web, mobile, and in-store platforms. It reduces manual effort, speeds up release cycles, and ensures consistent performance across all customer touchpoints. For retailers, this means faster innovation, fewer errors, and smoother integration between online and offline channels. For consumers, it translates into a seamless, reliable shopping experience—whether browsing on an app, purchasing online, or picking up in-store—ultimately boosting satisfaction and brand loyalty.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;4. Diversify globally and manage liquidity  \nGlobal diversification remains essential, but its role has changed. In a fragmented world, return dispersion between regions and sectors is likely to increase. Maintaining balanced global exposure reduces structural blind spots, while active management can tilt portfolios toward beneficiaries of supply-chain diversification or regional integration. Alongside this, liquidity must be managed. Family offices should maintain sufficient cash equivalents or low-risk assets to meet capital calls and spending needs even in stressed conditions. Far from being a drag, this liquidity buffer allows the broader portfolio to remain invested and provides optionality when markets dislocate. [...] 3. Use private markets to capture strategic shifts  \nPrivate markets are positioned to benefit from the realignment of global trade and security. Infrastructure and private equity managers can deploy capital into ports, logistics hubs, and national-security-linked technologies — assets that may attract policy support in a more factionalized world. Family offices, with their longer time horizons and capacity for illiquidity, are natural candidates to hold such positions. Within a perpetual portfolio, private allocations serve not only as growth drivers but also as exposure to the structural opportunities created by geopolitics. [...] ## We&#x27;re evolving.

For single family offices, whose desires are wealth preservation with intergenerational growth, this backdrop requires discipline and clarity.&quot;,

[...] The suit claims the Santa Clara-based company’s proprietary large language model (LLM) and deep learning-based technology analyze data from public resources including career sites, job boards, and resumé databases such as LinkedIn and Crunchbase. It also culls information from social media profiles, applicant locations, and behind-the-scenes tracking tools. None of these personal data points are ever included in job applications. [...] Eightfold markets itself as the “world’s largest, self-refreshing source of talent data” and incorporates more than 1.5 billion global data points, including job titles and worker profiles across “every job, profession, [and] industry.” It counts among its customers corporate giants including Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Starbucks, BNY, Paypal, Chevron, and Bayer.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Siliconangle\n\nSiliconangle\n\nUPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 22 2026\n\n SECURITY\n\n### Obsidian Security targets rising tide of SaaS integration threats\n\nby Paul Gillin\n\nObsidian Security Inc. today released a new suite of capabilities aimed at securing the software-as-a-service supply chain, offering what the company calls the first end-to-end protection for integrations between cloud-based applications.\n\nThe release comes as businesses increasingly rely on interconnected SaaS environments and autonomous artificial intelligence agents embedded in workflows. The company said such integrations, while valuable for automation and efficiency, have become a growing target for attackers exploiting blind spots in traditional security tools. [...] Founded by tech visionaries John Furrier and Dave Vellante, SiliconANGLE Media has built a dynamic ecosystem of industry-leading digital media brands that reach 15+ million elite tech professionals. Our new proprietary theCUBE AI Video Cloud is breaking ground in audience interaction, leveraging theCUBEai.com neural network to help technology companies make data-driven decisions and stay at the forefront of industry conversations.\n\n##### LATEST STORIES\n\nKeyfactor and IBM Consulting launch joint solution to accelerate post-quantum cryptography readiness\n\nSkeleton Key attack shows how hackers are bypassing malware defenses using legitimate software\n\nYuki launches with $6M in funding to help businesses manage spiraling AI data costs [...] ### Real-time detection and response\n\nThe new capabilities focus on three areas: visibility into SaaS-to-SaaS integration risks, early breach detection and rapid incident containment. Obsidian leverages a knowledge graph of usage patterns gathered from hundreds of customers to normalize identity and activity data across human and nonhuman users in various SaaS environments.\n\n“We correlate and normalize identity across all SaaS applications,” said Chief Executive Hasan Imam (pictured). “If you understand that the Hasan in Salesforce is the same as the Hasan in Workday, you can baseline Hasan across platforms.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Neither the lawyers for the plaintiffs nor for the defendants responded to requests for comment. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) also declined to comment.\n\n## Defensibility becomes the new bar\n\nThis lawsuit exposes a “governance failure” and “fundamental accountability gap,” noted Greyhound’s Gogia.\n\nAnd it’s not the first, nor will it likely be the last; HR company Workday, for instance, is facing a lawsuit alleging that its AI-powered hiring tools make decisions based on race, and also discriminate against older and disabled applicants. [...] ## Violating the 55-year-old FCRA\n\nThe suit was filed in the Superior Court of California by New York City-based law firm Outten &amp; Golden LLP, on behalf of Erin Kistler and Sruti Bhaumik. The plaintiffs claim they were barred from employment on several occasions by companies using AI-based hiring tools.\n\nThe class action complaint asserts that Eightfold AI violated federal and state fair credit and consumer reporting acts and unfair competition laws by collecting data on applicants and selling reports to companies for use in employment decision-making. These practices “can have profound consequences” for job-seekers across the US, the lawsuit claims.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech Trend #2: Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Now is the perfect moment to map your value streams and understand how workflows should operate, compared to how they actually work today. Don’t just improve outdated processes for the sake of convenience. Instead, use this new wave of AI to rethink how agents can best collaborate with people, enhance productivity, and streamline operations across the business,” - said Aleksandar Ganchev, Director Technology Strategy Transformation. [...] Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии. [...] „Сега е идеалният момент да направите анализ на добавената стойност (value stream mapping) и да разберете как трябва да функционират работните процеси в сравнение с начина, по който  те работят днес. Не подобрявайте остарели процеси само за удобство. Вместо това, използвайте тази нова вълна на AI, за да преосмислите как агентите могат най-ефективно да работят с хората да повишават продуктивността и да оптимизират операциите в целия бизнес,“ —споделяАлександър Ганчев, Директор Технологии Стратегии Трансформации.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech Trend #2: Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial challenges in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Преходът към агентен AI е не просто технологична еволюция  - това е дълбока организационна трансформация, която ще промени начина, по който предприятията ще работят, ще се конкурират и ще създават стойност. Организациите, които овладеят проектирането на процеси, съобразени с агентите, умелата оркестрация на множество агенти и управлението на „силициевата работна сила“, ще бъдат най-добре позиционирани да успеят в една все по-автоматизирана икономика. В крайна сметка успехът ще зависи от създаването на нови форми на взаимодействие между хора и AI  - такива, които използват допълващите се силни страни на човешката работна сила и тези на дигитални „служители“. [...] Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.” [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;After evaluating several providers, Workday stood out as a trusted AI-powered platform that aligned with MoneyHero’s values of Innovation, Empowerment, and Growth. “We liked that there was an accelerated path to value and no limits on our opportunity to grow,” says Agarwal. “Workday customer references also reassured us we were making the right decision.”\n\n## Accelerated path to tangible value.\n\nFor Agarwal, speed was of the essence to avoid losing momentum. “We&#x27;re on a growth trajectory, both in terms of our markets and our people. We expect our headcount to increase over the next few years,” she explains.

Its strength lies in combining technology, partnerships, and talent to deliver meaningful financial solutions to customers across the region. [...] Her formula for rapid success was to have clear priorities, a committed internal team, and strong collaboration with Workday and her deployment partner: EZE Cloud Consulting. Agarwal describes the entire experience as ‘fantastic’. “They didn&#x27;t just configure the system, they truly understood our framework and challenged us to adopt best practice. It felt like one combined team, making the project both cost effective and business relevant,” she recalls.&quot;,

[...] The suit claims the Santa Clara-based company’s proprietary large language model (LLM) and deep learning-based technology analyze data from public resources including career sites, job boards, and resumé databases such as LinkedIn and Crunchbase. It also culls information from social media profiles, applicant locations, and behind-the-scenes tracking tools. None of these personal data points are ever included in job applications. [...] Eightfold markets itself as the “world’s largest, self-refreshing source of talent data” and incorporates more than 1.5 billion global data points, including job titles and worker profiles across “every job, profession, [and] industry.” It counts among its customers corporate giants including Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Starbucks, BNY, Paypal, Chevron, and Bayer.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions in diagnostic errors, optimized treatment paths, and streamlined operations (see Health systems look to scale AI beyond the pilot phase). However, only about one-third of surveyed health care executives said their organizations are leveraging AI at scale. Moreover, fewer than half of them said they regularly assess the technology’s impact on the consumer experience, workforce productivity, or brand reputation. This disconnect between what is measured today and the full spectrum of technology’s value is what we call the “tech value gap” (see Considerations for health systems to help bridge the tech value gap). [...] What to watch in 2026: The traditional health care system, which is grounded in episodic and reactive care, might not be sustainable. While consumers are taking more control over their health care decisions, fewer than one-third of health care organizations are using AI at scale to support those customers. That could start to change this year. Some organizations are turning to generative and agentic AI to build trust and loyalty by helping patients stay on track with prescribed treatments, potentially signaling a new era of tech-enabled consumer support (see Agentic AI could transform treatment of chronic conditions).

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Now is the perfect moment to map your value streams and understand how workflows should operate, compared to how they actually work today. Don’t just improve outdated processes for the sake of convenience. Instead, use this new wave of AI to rethink how agents can best collaborate with people, enhance productivity, and streamline operations across the business,” - said Aleksandar Ganchev, Director Technology Strategy Transformation. [...] Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии. [...] „Сега е идеалният момент да направите анализ на добавената стойност (value stream mapping) и да разберете как трябва да функционират работните процеси в сравнение с начина, по който  те работят днес. Не подобрявайте остарели процеси само за удобство. Вместо това, използвайте тази нова вълна на AI, за да преосмислите как агентите могат най-ефективно да работят с хората да повишават продуктивността и да оптимизират операциите в целия бизнес,“ —споделяАлександър Ганчев, Директор Технологии Стратегии Трансформации.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions in diagnostic errors, optimized treatment paths, and streamlined operations (see Health systems look to scale AI beyond the pilot phase). However, only about one-third of surveyed health care executives said their organizations are leveraging AI at scale. Moreover, fewer than half of them said they regularly assess the technology’s impact on the consumer experience, workforce productivity, or brand reputation. This disconnect between what is measured today and the full spectrum of technology’s value is what we call the “tech value gap” (see Considerations for health systems to help bridge the tech value gap). [...] What to watch in 2026: The traditional health care system, which is grounded in episodic and reactive care, might not be sustainable. While consumers are taking more control over their health care decisions, fewer than one-third of health care organizations are using AI at scale to support those customers. That could start to change this year. Some organizations are turning to generative and agentic AI to build trust and loyalty by helping patients stay on track with prescribed treatments, potentially signaling a new era of tech-enabled consumer support (see Agentic AI could transform treatment of chronic conditions). This year, more than half of surveyed health plan executives said they intend to invest in initiatives that expand the use of digital tools for member engagement and [...] What to watch in 2026: This could be the year that a majority of LSHC organizations move beyond piloting AI and begin system-wide integration. Achieving AI maturity remains aspirational for most organizations, but that appears to be changing. Nearly half of surveyed life sciences executives identified accelerated digital transformation as a trend that is likely to have a substantial impact on their organizations in 2026—a statistically significant increase compared with 2025. Biopharma and medtech leaders generally anticipate that AI will help boost organizational efficiency this year, and most expect it will play a central role in driving major change.&quot;,

In a fragmented world, return dispersion between regions and sectors is likely to increase. Maintaining balanced global exposure reduces structural blind spots, while active management can tilt portfolios toward beneficiaries of supply-chain diversification or regional integration. Alongside this, liquidity must be managed. Family offices should maintain sufficient cash equivalents or low-risk assets to meet capital calls and spending needs even in stressed conditions. Far from being a drag, this liquidity buffer allows the broader portfolio to remain invested and provides optionality when markets dislocate.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech Trend #2: Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Now is the perfect moment to map your value streams and understand how workflows should operate, compared to how they actually work today. Don’t just improve outdated processes for the sake of convenience. Instead, use this new wave of AI to rethink how agents can best collaborate with people, enhance productivity, and streamline operations across the business,” - said Aleksandar Ganchev, Director Technology Strategy Transformation. [...] Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии. [...] „Сега е идеалният момент да направите анализ на добавената стойност (value stream mapping) и да разберете как трябва да функционират работните процеси в сравнение с начина, по който  те работят днес. Не подобрявайте остарели процеси само за удобство. Вместо това, използвайте тази нова вълна на AI, за да преосмислите как агентите могат най-ефективно да работят с хората да повишават продуктивността и да оптимизират операциите в целия бизнес,“ —споделяАлександър Ганчев, Директор Технологии Стратегии Трансформации.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] Perhaps the most profound change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor—a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] Redesigning operations for a human–digital future\n\nLeading organizations are addressing these challenges by adopting a systematic approach to agentic transformation, moving beyond simply layering agents onto legacy workflows. This requires stepping back to examine end-to-end processes and leveraging agents’ distinctive strengths, such as continuous, high-volume task execution without human constraints like breaks or working hours.\n\n“Now is an ideal time to conduct value stream mapping to understand how workflows should work versus the way they do work. Don’t simply pave the cow path. Instead, take advantage of this AI evolution to reimagine how agents can best collaborate, support, and optimize operations for the business.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;adopters have demonstrated improvements, such as reductions in diagnostic errors, optimized treatment paths, and streamlined operations (see Health systems look to scale AI beyond the pilot phase). However, only about one-third of surveyed health care executives said their organizations are leveraging AI at scale. Moreover, fewer than half of them said they regularly assess the technology’s impact on the consumer experience, workforce productivity, or brand reputation. This disconnect between what is measured today and the full spectrum of technology’s value is what we call the “tech value gap” (see Considerations for health systems to help bridge the tech value gap). [...] What to watch in 2026: The traditional health care system, which is grounded in episodic and reactive care, might not be sustainable. While consumers are taking more control over their health care decisions, fewer than one-third of health care organizations are using AI at scale to support those customers. That could start to change this year. Some organizations are turning to generative and agentic AI to build trust and loyalty by helping patients stay on track with prescribed treatments, potentially signaling a new era of tech-enabled consumer support (see Agentic AI could transform treatment of chronic conditions). This year, more than half of surveyed health plan executives said they intend to invest in initiatives that expand the use of digital tools for member engagement and [...] What to watch in 2026: This could be the year that a majority of LSHC organizations move beyond piloting AI and begin system-wide integration. Achieving AI maturity remains aspirational for most organizations, but that appears to be changing. Nearly half of surveyed life sciences executives identified accelerated digital transformation as a trend that is likely to have a substantial impact on their organizations in 2026—a statistically significant increase compared with 2025. Biopharma and medtech leaders generally anticipate that AI will help boost organizational efficiency this year, and most expect it will play a central role in driving major change.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How to get your enterprise architecture ready for agentic AI - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Action: Focus your integration investments on the systems that agents will orchestrate across most often. Working with clients, the ones we see most often include customer-facing operations, financial workflows, HR platforms, IT infrastructure, and compliance. But create agent-friendly APIs for these core paths first. Start with event-driven architectures that reveal not just data, but business context and rules that agents can understand autonomously. For time-critical value chains, consider deploying real-time data integration and event-based architecture patterns.\n\n3. Build a new architectural layer to enable autonomous operations\n\nOrganizations need to create an agent tier in their enterprise architecture. This is made up of: [...] According to Accenture’s latest Pulse of Changesurvey of 3,650 executives conducted late last year, 67% of executives said AI would substantially or completely transform their organization’s core. Some 15% said they’re working on agentic POCs, with 31% running pilots in specific functions, and 31% currently deploying agents across multiple functions.\n\nThis suggests that while agentic AI is a workplace reality, most organizations are at the start of their journey. To get beyond POCs and limited pilots, companies will need to adjust their infrastructure to support autonomous operations across system boundaries.\n\n3 critical upgrades and how to execute them\n\n1. Data quality requires new standards and guardrails [...] Credit: Lazy_Bear / Shutterstock \n\nAgentic AI works in a different way than the gen AI tools many enterprises have deployed over the past two years. Where ChatGPT-style assistants analyze data and recommend actions for humans to execute, agentic AI systems take multiple autonomous actions to achieve business goals. These systems access data across the front, middle, and back office, as well as to external sources. They break down historic functional silos to automate broader end-to-end value chains, without human intervention.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why the AI future needs human-powered reinvention&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The biggest risk is optimising a model of work that is already becoming obsolete. Automating existing processes can deliver short-term efficiency gains, but it also reinforces legacy assumptions about roles, decision rights, and control structures.\n\nAgentic AI challenges those assumptions. It can coordinate work, adapt in real time, and operate across silos of humans and data in ways traditional hierarchies were never designed to support. Organisations that only automate end up layering AI on top of processes that no longer make sense, rather than redesigning how value is created. Reinvention requires leaders to rethink workflows, roles, and governance from the ground up, not simply make today’s model run faster. [...] ## Q6: You’ve mentioned new roles being created – such as Agentic Process Designers – but their lagging behind the development and adoption of AI itself. How can businesses catch up?\n\nOrganisations need to stop treating roles as fixed job descriptions and start treating them as evolving design choices. Agentic AI changes workflows faster than traditional workforce planning cycles can keep up with. [...] This changes how teams operate day to day. Decisions can move faster, work can scale without linear increases in headcount, and collaboration becomes less about managing handoffs and more about guiding outcomes. As a result, we are already seeing the emergence of new roles focused on designing, supervising, and improving human–agent systems, not just performing individual tasks within them.\n\n## Q5: How can leaders build trust among employees around the potential disruption that Agentic AI brings with it?&quot;,

Agentic AI is not a monolithic capability; it is composed of multiple interdependent elements that each require high-quality metadata and organizational alignment. Consider the reasoning engine, the central “brain” of an agentic framework. For this engine to function as intended, it must be supplied with a rich foundation of enterprise, specific knowledge assets, business [...] AI agents are unlocking new possibilities in data governance and stewardship, driving automation and intelligence across traditionally manual processes. A prime example is the Business Glossary Definition Generator, an advanced accelerator developed by the Capgemini Data Trust team.

Another survey from Pew Research found that a lack of career development is the most common reason for quitting a job.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI eradicating the junior developer? - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Now, with the introduction of agentic capabilities, developers can potentially take a step back from line-by-line and function-by-function oversight, allowing agents to take over development, code review, defect fixing and even refactoring. This frees their time to focus on the more complex problems that require nuance and critical thinking, extending beyond code execution to interactions with teams, customers and end users — all skills that don’t play to AI’s core capabilities today. [...] Microsoft also rolled out coding support this year, introducing two open-source frameworks to support agentic AI development: AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. AutoGen requires minimal human input, even for complex workflows and facilitates asynchronous messaging, modular components and distributed agent collaboration.\n\nMeanwhile, the Semantic Kernel SDK enables integration of LLMs with programming languages like C#, Python and Java, enabling developers to create AI agents that can automate various tasks and oversee enterprise applications. [...] ## The state of the software labor market\n\nWhile AI capabilities offer appealing opportunities to speed up the software development process and streamline costs for organizations, moving full speed ahead with AI-first operations may be shortsighted. To ensure the continued quality of software and the availability of a strong talent pipeline, organizations must consider the long-term importance of maintaining a human-first approach to software development.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial challenges in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] ## New research from the Deloitte Tech Trends report reveals that while agentic artificial intelligence (AI) promises autonomous operations and intelligent execution, many enterprises are struggling to move beyond pilot projects. True value creation stems from fundamentally redesigning operations and managing AI agents as a “silicon-based workforce” that complements human talent—rather than simply automating existing processes.\n\nThe agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human–AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the full Deloitte Tech Trends report.\n\n##### This text in Bulgarian language\n\n#### Технологични тенденции #2:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential: Strategic ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice\n\nEnterprises are rapidly exploring agentic AI, with Gartner predicting that 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, a significant increase from virtually none in 2024. Despite this momentum, many organizations face substantial hurdles in translating agentic pilots into production-ready solutions. Deloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study indicates that only 14% of organizations have deployable solutions, and just 11% are actively using these systems in production. [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human–AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the original article on the Deloitte Insights website.\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\nYes;)\n\nNo;)\n\n#### Thanks for your feedback [...] Several fundamental infrastructure challenges contribute to this gap. Traditional enterprise systems-often not designed for real-time, autonomous agent interactions-create significant bottlenecks, with Gartner forecasting that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027 due to legacy system incompatibility. In addition, data architectures built around batch-based Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes introduce friction for agent deployment. Many organizations also attempt to automate existing, human-centric processes instead of reimagining workflows for an agent-native environment, resulting in inefficient implementations and, in some cases, “workslop”—where poorly designed agentic applications actually increase operational burden.&quot;,

In real life, you’re operating across Slack and Google Drive and all these other tools.” For many agentic AI models, that kind of multi-domain reasoning is still hit or miss.\n\nThe scenarios were all drawn from actual professionals on Mercor’s expert marketplace, who both laid out the queries and set the standard for a successful response.

A new benchmark raises doubts\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nIt’s been nearly two years since Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted AI would replace knowledge work — the white-collar jobs held by lawyers, investment bankers, librarians, accountants, IT, and others. [...] While the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the APEX-Agents test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs that believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come.\n\n“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or 10% of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”\n\nTopics\n\nagentic ai, AI, Exclusive, investment banking, knowledge work, law\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nAI Editor&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI exposes what we&#x27;re doing wrong&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is where many enterprises will stumble. They’ll give an agent broad API permissions to be helpful, then act surprised when it becomes broadly dangerous. The correct posture is to treat every agent as a privileged workload until proven otherwise because agents are effectively operators with superhuman speed. You need explicit identities for agents, tight authorization boundaries, short-lived credentials, audited tool access, and strong separation between environments and duties. [...] If you want the blunt takeaway, it’s this: Agentic AI makes cloud discipline non-negotiable. The organizations that treat it as an architectural and operational shift will do well, and the ones that treat it as another feature to turn on will learn quickly how expensive improvisation can be.\n\n## Related content\n\n### JetBrains IDEs integrate OpenAI Codex\n\n### MuleSoft gains Agent Scanners to rein in enterprise AI chaos\n\n### AI agents and IT ops: Cowboy chaos rides again\n\n## Other Sections\n\nDavid Linthicum [...] What needs to change is the level of precision and adaptability in network controls. You need networking that supports fine-grained segmentation, short-lived connectivity, and policies that can be continuously evaluated rather than set once and forgotten. You also need to treat east-west traffic visibility as a core requirement because agents will generate many internal calls that look legitimate unless you understand intent, identity, and context.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A standout example was the “industrial metaverse” work coming from Siemens in partnership with NVIDIA. By combining physical and employee digital twins — using 2D and 3D models enriched with real-time operational data — organizations can simulate entire manufacturing environments before making physical changes. AI agents test real-life scenarios, optimize workflows, and even align worker skills and physical traits to operational tasks. This is employee experience design at industrial scale — and safer operations is the big win.\n\nSiemens and Nvidia partnership on Industrial Metaverse - Architectural schema [...] At the same time, enterprise-managed versions of these technologies could unlock real value: hands-free note-taking, AI meeting summaries in nontraditional office spaces, and AI-driven support for deskless workers. The challenge isn’t what’s possible — it’s readiness.\n\nAnd that’s the reality check I heard repeatedly from vendors: Wearable adoption is still largely experimental. The barriers are familiar but formidable: inconsistent global data privacy laws, evolving AI regulations, and limited operational maturity to deploy and scale these tools across fragmented tech ecosystems.\n\n## A Grounded View Of The Future [...] Image of a human head morphing with a digital head to represent digital twin  \nOn the enterprise side, Lenovo’s xIQ Digital Workplace Platform showed how AI can deliver hyperpersonalized insights by role, function, and digital dexterity — even allowing leaders to tune recommendations based on desired outcomes such as cost reduction. Importantly, the user-friendly interface makes these insights accessible to both IT and non-IT stakeholders, signaling how AI can democratize DEX decision-making.\n\nImage of a human head morphing with a digital head to represent digital twin\nLenovo xIQ persona clusters screenshot\nScreenshot of outcome sliders for Lenovo xIQ digital workplace platform\n\n## Wearables: Opportunity, Impacts, And Growing Risks&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Slowly and Then All at Once\n\nCompanies are currently deploying agents with ambitious goals, but most implementations remain focused on specific use cases. Right now, the demand for multi-agent architecture may not seem pressing to companies that are still rolling out an employee help desk agent. [...] # Multi-Agent AI Is Coming Fast. Here’s How to Prepare\n\nMulti-Agent AI Is Coming Fast. Here’s How to Prepare\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nWithin enterprises,AI agents have moved from prototype to production — answering customer queries, generating code, and tracking inventory, among other tasks.\n\nBut single agents are just the beginning. The next phase will see the orchestration of multiple agents to perform complex, automated tasks both inside companies and across organizational boundaries with customers and partners. That shift creates new governance challenges around visibility, coordination, accountability, and trust. [...] Researchers have already identified unexpected problems, like “echoing.” Because AI models are trained to be accommodating, two agents interacting can fall into a feedback loop of endless agreement that undermines the objectives of their owners. One case study from Salesforce AI Research examined what happens when a customer’s agent seeks to return ill-fitting shoes to a retailer’s service agent. The exchange ended with both agents agreeing that the customer would keep the shoes, pay a 25% restocking fee, and consider buying a second pair out of appreciation for the retailer’s “fair policies.” When agents represent opposing interests, ensuring they remain loyal to the organizations they serve cannot be assumed — it must be engineered into the system.&quot;,

High technology investment, staff training, and maintaining a unified customer service add to the challenges because of organisational silos and data privacy compliance requirements, further complicating operations. Overall, while omnichannel retail offers convenience and reach, it demands strong coordination between technology, logistics, and people to deliver a seamless and profitable experience. Agentic AI is a powerful tool to help achieve these goals. [...] | 4 | Personalisation at scale | Customers expect real-time personalisation; traditional rule-based methods do not scale with dynamic demand. | Engagement agents deliver hyper-personalised content; content curation agents adapt storefronts or app user interfaces (UIs); voice, chat AI agents provide individualised recommendations. |\n| 5 | Channel silos and poor orchestration | Lack of synchronisation between channels disrupts seamless experiences. | Campaign orchestration agents align promotions across all channels; order lifecycle agents manage end-to-end flows; collaboration agents escalate exceptions to humans as needed. |&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Alec Scott is a technology executive who has spent his career at the intersection of infrastructure, cybersecurity and large-scale transformation. He has developed strategy, architected operating models and led IT and platform teams across healthcare, financial services, insurance and private equity, guiding organizations through cloud modernization, service delivery maturation and the emergence of agentic AI. His work emphasizes using intelligence—not just automation—to improve decision quality, strengthen operational resilience and build trust between business leaders and the systems that increasingly act on their behalf. [...] AI dissolves those walls.\n\nFor the first time, the enterprise begins to function as one coherent intelligence system. Everything influences everything else.\n\nFinance, supply chain and sales forecasting merge into a single learning loop. IT, operations and security operate on shared telemetry. HR and operations adjust workforce readiness in real time. Marketing and service orchestrate adaptive journeys for every customer.\n\nThese are no longer collaborations, they are intelligent feedback circuits. Once they take hold, competitors cannot easily keep up because replication requires much more than buying tools. It requires deep process maturity, unified data foundations, shared context, disciplined governance and the organizational courage to encode behaviors into agents and models.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Jassy had said earlier in 2025 that he expected Amazon’s corporate workforce to shrink over time as a result of efficiencies gained from the use of AI.\n\nCorporations are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December.\n\nThe full 30,000 jobs would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the firm’s corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon’s workers are in fulfillment centers and warehouses.\n\nIt would be the largest layoff in Amazon’s three-decade history. The company trimmed about 27,000 jobs in 2022.

The people cautioned that the details of Amazon&#x27;s plans could change.\n\nPREVIOUS CUTS TIED TO AI [...] PREVIOUS CUTS TIED TO AI\n\nThe Seattle online retailer tied the October round of job cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.”\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nHowever, CEO Andy Jassy later told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture,\&quot; meaning the company has too much bureaucracy.\n\n“You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,\&quot; he said.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workers challenge &#x27;hidden&#x27; AI hiring tools in class action ... - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Where AI hiring helps, where it hurts\n\nThat’s not to say that AI can’t be valuable in hiring; many real-world examples have proven that it can. The Human Resources Professionals Association, for one, points to successful use of AI in initial talent sourcing, screening, and assessment, while AI scribes can quietly take notes, helping recruiters focus more intently on candidate discussions.\n\nGogia agreed that AI can filter and rank large applicant pools, automate repetitive HR tasks, and identify overlooked candidates within internal databases. This means hiring teams can move faster, hone their focus, be more consistent, and reduce friction. [...] Eightfold markets itself as the “world’s largest, self-refreshing source of talent data” and incorporates more than 1.5 billion global data points, including job titles and worker profiles across “every job, profession, [and] industry.” It counts among its customers corporate giants including Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Starbucks, BNY, Paypal, Chevron, and Bayer. [...] ## Violating the 55-year-old FCRA\n\nThe suit was filed in the Superior Court of California by New York City-based law firm Outten &amp; Golden LLP, on behalf of Erin Kistler and Sruti Bhaumik. The plaintiffs claim they were barred from employment on several occasions by companies using AI-based hiring tools.\n\nThe class action complaint asserts that Eightfold AI violated federal and state fair credit and consumer reporting acts and unfair competition laws by collecting data on applicants and selling reports to companies for use in employment decision-making. These practices “can have profound consequences” for job-seekers across the US, the lawsuit claims.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Humans&amp; thinks coordination is the next frontier for AI, and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives Humans&amp; a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&amp;A is certainly a risk.\n\nHumans&amp; told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired.\n\n“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”\n\nTopics\n\nAI, ai collaboration, Exclusive, humans&amp;, Startups\n\n\n\n       Connie Loizos [...] The top risk, though, is that Humans&amp; isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows. [...] “We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a Humans&amp; co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).\n\nLong-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;But all of this activity has created a new challenge: agent sprawl. Specialized AI agents and tools are being deployed across teams, functions, and platforms — often without visibility and governance, creating the risk of shadow AI.Without a scalable way to find and track agents across multiple platforms, this sprawl makes it hard to understand not only what agents are operating in your organization but also how they reason, what they act on, and what outcomes they drive. [...] # Salesforce Expands MuleSoft Agent Fabric with Automated Discovery for Any AI Agent or Tool\n\nMuleSoft Agent Fabric with Automated Discovery for Any AI Agent, Tool\n\nThe era of the Agentic Enterprise is upon us, and CIOs, IT leaders, and their teams are experimenting with agents at an unprecedented rate. IDC projects the number of actively deployed AI agents to exceed 1 billion worldwide by 2029 — 40 times more than 2025. [...] Today’s enhancements to MuleSoft Agent Fabric bridge and simplify this fragmented landscape into a governed and cohesive agent network, giving you a single control plane for all your AI agents, tools, and metadata. This update centers around new Agent Scanners, giving you the ability to automatically detect and catalog AI agents across Salesforce Agentforce, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, and other agent platforms. For other assets, like Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and bespoke agents, additional capabilities make registration just as simple.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Multi-Agent AI Is Coming Fast. Here&#x27;s How to Prepare&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Even companies with single agent deployments can get mired in what The Verge’s Nilay Patel calls the “DoorDash problem.” When AI agents insert themselves between businesses and customers, companies risk losing the ability to monetize through ads, loyalty programs, upsells, and partnerships. They become commodity providers competing on price alone. But single-agent disruption is just the opening act. When agents start negotiating with other agents on behalf of competing or even partner organizations, the governance challenges become far more acute.\n\nBecause AI models are trained to be accommodating, two agents interacting can fall into a feedback loop of endless agreement that undermines the objectives of their owners. [...] # Multi-Agent AI Is Coming Fast. Here’s How to Prepare\n\nMulti-Agent AI Is Coming Fast. Here’s How to Prepare\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nWithin enterprises,AI agents have moved from prototype to production — answering customer queries, generating code, and tracking inventory, among other tasks.\n\nBut single agents are just the beginning. The next phase will see the orchestration of multiple agents to perform complex, automated tasks both inside companies and across organizational boundaries with customers and partners. That shift creates new governance challenges around visibility, coordination, accountability, and trust. [...] ## Slowly and Then All at Once\n\nCompanies are currently deploying agents with ambitious goals, but most implementations remain focused on specific use cases. Right now, the demand for multi-agent architecture may not seem pressing to companies that are still rolling out an employee help desk agent.&quot;,

They will evolve from existing business, operations, and technology roles.\&quot; Skills sought require \&quot;a deliberate blend of business expertise, AI literacy, and no-code configuration.\&quot;\n\n## The common thread is ownership\n\nSuch new roles include the following four:\n\nThe common thread across all these roles, Dovgan added, is ownership -- \&quot;ownership of outcomes, accountability for agent behavior, and continuous optimization as business conditions change.\&quot; [...] For professionals with technology acumen, at least four emerging job roles are emerging, especially with the rise of agentic AI. I recently explored these opportunities with Andie Dovgan, chief growth officer at Creatio, who identified the emerging roles he sees: AI leaders, agent operators, AI no-code creators, and workflow architects.\n\nAlso: Got AI skills? You can earn 43% more in your next job - and not just for tech work\n\n\&quot;AI is not simply being added as another layer of automation,\&quot; Dovgan explained. \&quot;It requires building new workflow architecture. It is reshaping how work itself is designed, executed, and governed.\&quot; [...] Early on, external help may be required to get started with agentic AI as internal teams develop their expertise and experience. \&quot;The shift elevates internal IT and operations teams,\&quot; Dovgan predicted. \&quot;They will need to learn new skills and apply different approaches towards agentic automation as previous playbooks won&#x27;t work.\&quot;\n\nAlso: Deploying AI agents is not your typical software launch - 7 lessons from the trenches&quot;,

A new benchmark raises doubts\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nIt’s been nearly two years since Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted AI would replace knowledge work — the white-collar jobs held by lawyers, investment bankers, librarians, accountants, IT, and others. [...] The new research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. The result is a new benchmark called APEX-Agents — and so far, every AI lab is getting a failing grade. Faced with queries from real professionals, even the best models struggled to get more than a quarter of the questions right. The vast majority of the time, the model came back with a wrong answer or no answer at all.\n\nAccording to Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, who worked on the paper, the models’ biggest stumbling point was tracking down information across multiple domains — something that’s integral to most of the knowledge work performed by humans. [...] While the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the APEX-Agents test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs that believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come.\n\n“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or 10% of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”\n\nTopics\n\nagentic ai, AI, Exclusive, investment banking, knowledge work, law\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nAI Editor&quot;,

AutoGen requires minimal human input, even for complex workflows and facilitates asynchronous messaging, modular components and distributed agent collaboration.\n\nMeanwhile, the Semantic Kernel SDK enables integration of LLMs with programming languages like C#, Python and Java, enabling developers to create AI agents that can automate various tasks and oversee enterprise applications. [...] Now, with the introduction of agentic capabilities, developers can potentially take a step back from line-by-line and function-by-function oversight, allowing agents to take over development, code review, defect fixing and even refactoring. This frees their time to focus on the more complex problems that require nuance and critical thinking, extending beyond code execution to interactions with teams, customers and end users — all skills that don’t play to AI’s core capabilities today.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;All Posts\n\n# Everything in voice AI just changed: how enterprise AI builders can benefit\n\nCarl Franzen\n\nDespite lots of hype, \&quot;voice AI\&quot; has so far largely been a euphemism for a request-response loop. You speak, a cloud server transcribes your words, a language model thinks, and a robotic voice reads the text back. Functional, but not really conversational.\n\nThat all changed in the past week with a rapid succession of powerful, fast, and more capable voice AI model releases from Nvidia, Inworld, FlashLabs, and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen team, combined with a massive talent acquisition and tech licensing deal by Google DeepMind and Hume AI.\n\nNow, the industry has effectively solved the four \&quot;impossible\&quot; problems of voice computing: latency, fluidity, efficiency, and emotion. [...] Inworld AI’s release of TTS 1.5 directly attacks this bottleneck. By achieving a P90 latency of under 120ms, Inworld has effectively pushed the technology faster than human perception.\n\nFor developers building customer service agents or interactive training avatars, this means the \&quot;thinking pause\&quot; is dead.\n\nCrucially, Inworld claims this model achieves \&quot;viseme-level synchronization,\&quot; meaning the lip movements of a digital avatar will match the audio frame-by-frame—a requirement for high-fidelity gaming and VR training.\n\nIt&#x27;s vailable via commercial API (pricing tiers based on usage) with a free tier for testing. [...] Hume’s models and data infrastructure are available via proprietary enterprise licensing.\n\n## 5. The new enterprise voice AI playbook\n\nWith these pieces in place, the \&quot;Voice Stack\&quot; for 2026 looks radically different.\n\n The Brain: An LLM (like Gemini or GPT-4o) provides the reasoning.\n The Body: Efficient, open-weight models like PersonaPlex (Nvidia), Chroma (FlashLabs), or Qwen3-TTS handle the turn-taking, synthesis, and compression, allowing developers to host their own highly responsive agents.\n The Soul: Platforms like Hume provide the annotated data and emotional weighting to ensure the AI \&quot;reads the room,\&quot; preventing the reputational damage of a tone-deaf bot.\n\nEttinger claims the market demand for this specific \&quot;emotional layer\&quot; is exploding beyond just tech assistants.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why the AI future needs human-powered reinvention&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Do not mistake automation for transformation. Agentic AI’s real value lies not in making existing work cheaper or faster, but in enabling organisations to rethink how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how leadership is exercised.\n\nLeaders who focus only on efficiency will capture incremental gains. Those who are willing to redesign their organisations around human–agent collaboration can unlock entirely new sources of value. That choice needs to be made deliberately, and sooner rather than later.\n\n## Explore our services\n\nScale AI for your business\n\n## Next Tech Agenda [...] This second track often challenges existing power structures, roles, and revenue streams, which is uncomfortable by design. But it allows leaders to explore what comes next before the current model starts to break down. The balance comes from accepting that part of the organisation is investing in its own disruption, rather than pretending transformation can be achieved without trade-offs.\n\n## Q4: You’ve mentioned that Agentic AI is proactive – with this enhanced capability, what will the ‘new models of human-agent collaboration’ look like?\n\nHuman–agent collaboration will shift the centre of gravity of work. People will increasingly focus on judgement, context, ethics, and problem framing, while agents handle coordination, data synthesis, and large-scale execution. [...] This changes how teams operate day to day. Decisions can move faster, work can scale without linear increases in headcount, and collaboration becomes less about managing handoffs and more about guiding outcomes. As a result, we are already seeing the emergence of new roles focused on designing, supervising, and improving human–agent systems, not just performing individual tasks within them.\n\n## Q5: How can leaders build trust among employees around the potential disruption that Agentic AI brings with it?&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why the AI future needs human-powered reinvention&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Do not mistake automation for transformation. Agentic AI’s real value lies not in making existing work cheaper or faster, but in enabling organisations to rethink how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how leadership is exercised.\n\nLeaders who focus only on efficiency will capture incremental gains. Those who are willing to redesign their organisations around human–agent collaboration can unlock entirely new sources of value. That choice needs to be made deliberately, and sooner rather than later.\n\n## Explore our services\n\nScale AI for your business\n\n## Next Tech Agenda [...] The biggest risk is optimising a model of work that is already becoming obsolete. Automating existing processes can deliver short-term efficiency gains, but it also reinforces legacy assumptions about roles, decision rights, and control structures.\n\nAgentic AI challenges those assumptions. It can coordinate work, adapt in real time, and operate across silos of humans and data in ways traditional hierarchies were never designed to support. Organisations that only automate end up layering AI on top of processes that no longer make sense, rather than redesigning how value is created. Reinvention requires leaders to rethink workflows, roles, and governance from the ground up, not simply make today’s model run faster. [...] This second track often challenges existing power structures, roles, and revenue streams, which is uncomfortable by design. But it allows leaders to explore what comes next before the current model starts to break down. The balance comes from accepting that part of the organisation is investing in its own disruption, rather than pretending transformation can be achieved without trade-offs.\n\n## Q4: You’ve mentioned that Agentic AI is proactive – with this enhanced capability, what will the ‘new models of human-agent collaboration’ look like?\n\nHuman–agent collaboration will shift the centre of gravity of work. People will increasingly focus on judgement, context, ethics, and problem framing, while agents handle coordination, data synthesis, and large-scale execution.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### From our editors straight to your inbox\n\nTaryn Plumb is a freelance writer specializing in AI and cybersecurity. She has also written about data infrastructure, quantum computing, networking hardware and software, and the metaverse. In a previous life she was a news and features reporter for The Boston Globe and numerous other outlets and business journals. She is also the author of several regional history books.\n\n## More from this author\n\n### Enterprise AI investments are forging ahead despite elusive ROI\n\n### This Intune update isn’t optional — it’s a kill switch for outdated apps\n\n### One click is all it takes: How ‘Reprompt’ turned Microsoft Copilot into a data exfiltration tool\n\n### Enterprises still aren’t getting IAM right [...] Image\n\n### Apple Picks Gemini AI, Iran Goes Dark, PCs Boom | Ep. 36\n\nImage\n\n### Europe’s Digital Push, CrowdStrike Buys, Copilot Phish Risk | Ep. 38\n\nImage\n\n### Google’s UCP Debuts, IBM Sovereign Core, AI Risks | Ep. 37\n\nImage\n\n### Apple Picks Gemini AI, Iran Goes Dark, PCs Boom | Ep. 36\n\nImage\n\nSponsored Links [...] ## Where AI hiring helps, where it hurts\n\nThat’s not to say that AI can’t be valuable in hiring; many real-world examples have proven that it can. The Human Resources Professionals Association, for one, points to successful use of AI in initial talent sourcing, screening, and assessment, while AI scribes can quietly take notes, helping recruiters focus more intently on candidate discussions.\n\nGogia agreed that AI can filter and rank large applicant pools, automate repetitive HR tasks, and identify overlooked candidates within internal databases. This means hiring teams can move faster, hone their focus, be more consistent, and reduce friction.&quot;,

You can use this type of automation to automate highly repetitive\ntasks.\n\nFor example, Report generation. In this use case, the reports are automatically generated and distributed to relevant stakeholders.\n\nUnattended automation offer significant efficiency gains, reduced operational costs, and improved accuracy in organizations.\n\nAlso known as human-assisted automation. In this automation, the robots work alongside human users to augment their tasks and activities. You can use this type of automation with human supervision. [...] For example, Customer service. In this use case, robots can assist customer service representatives by providing relevant information, suggesting responses, and automating data entry. The robots are installed on\noperator’s workstations and are triggered by human operators on demand.\n\nAttended automation is often suited for scenarios where a combination of automation and human judgment is required to handle complex, dynamic, or non-standard tasks.\n\n## Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Hub users\n\nTable 1.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How learning enterprises compete | CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI dissolves those walls.\n\nFor the first time, the enterprise begins to function as one coherent intelligence system. Everything influences everything else.\n\nFinance, supply chain and sales forecasting merge into a single learning loop. IT, operations and security operate on shared telemetry. HR and operations adjust workforce readiness in real time. Marketing and service orchestrate adaptive journeys for every customer.\n\nThese are no longer collaborations, they are intelligent feedback circuits. Once they take hold, competitors cannot easily keep up because replication requires much more than buying tools. It requires deep process maturity, unified data foundations, shared context, disciplined governance and the organizational courage to encode behaviors into agents and models. [...] These are not features. They are moats. And they cannot be copied quickly, no matter how much capital a competitor throws at the problem.\n\n## Why learning enterprises pull away: combinatorial advantage\n\nAI’s most meaningful impact is not task automation, it is connection. When you connect data, processes, decisions, customer signals and operational telemetry, you get something far more powerful: combinatorial advantage.\n\nTraditional organizations operate as collections of functions. Finance makes decisions in its world. Supply chain makes decisions in its world. Marketing, HR, IT, operations, each with its own systems, its own language, its own data, its own reality.\n\nAI dissolves those walls.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turning bystanders into the kind of leader MIT Sloan calls Captains — leaders with a strategic, organization-wide perspective — happens before they become leaders. It starts when you sit down with a team member, listen to their goals, and help them get there. This makes them more likely to stay and get promoted to a senior role. Having experienced the power of that simple act, they then do it for their own team.\n\n“It becomes a generational thing,” says Pulliam. “They do this because they have a role model that demonstrated something very effective. But it starts with a grassroots effort.”\n\nThat’s not to say that you have to do this alone. Your HR department can’t change the culture for you, but they can be a resource as you do it.

Internal teams at PDI Technologies were struggling with information scattered across disparate systems including websites, Confluence pages, SharePoint sites, and various other data sources. To address this, PDI Technologies built PDI Intelligence Query (PDIQ), an AI assistant that gives employees access to company knowledge through an easy-to-use chat interface. This solution is powered by a custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using serverless technologies. Building PDIQ required addressing the following key challenges: [...] `![image-20230818-114454: The image displays a security tip notification on a computer screen. The notification is titled \&quot;Security tip\&quot; and advises the user to use generated passwords to keep their accounts safe. The suggested password, \&quot;2m5oFX#g&amp;tLRMhN3,\&quot; is shown in a green box. Below the suggested password, there is a section labeled \&quot;Very Strong,\&quot; indicating the strength of the password. The password length is set to 16 characters, and it includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. There is also a \&quot;Dismiss\&quot; button to close the notification. Below the password section, there is a link to \&quot;See password history.\&quot; The bottom of the image shows navigation icons for \&quot;Vault,\&quot; \&quot;Generator,\&quot; \&quot;Alerts,\&quot; and \&quot;Account.\&quot; The \&quot;Generator\&quot; icon is highlighted in red.] [...] This is the most critical step of the process. The key objective of this step is to generate vector embeddings so that they can be used for similarity matching and effective retrieval based on user inquiry. The process follows several steps, starting with image captioning, then document chunking, summary generation, and embedding generation. To caption the images, PDIQ scans the markdown files to locate image tags &lt;image&gt;. For each of these images, PDIQ scans and generates an image caption that explains the content of the image. This caption gets injected back into the markdown file, next to the &lt;image&gt; tag, thereby enriching the document content. This approach offers improved contextual searchability. PDIQ enhances content discovery by embedding insights extracted from images directly&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workers challenge &#x27;hidden&#x27; AI hiring tools in class action ... - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;If courts agree that AI evaluations function like credit reports, hiring will be pushed into regulated territory, Gogia noted; this means CIOs must establish clarity and set rules around notification, transparency, audit rights, and contestability.\n\n“If your hiring tools operate like decision engines, they need to be governed like decision infrastructure,” he said. And when they influence employment decisions, enterprises will have to prove they’ve done their homework. This means showing the logic behind a model, understanding data provenance, and being able to explain why an applicant was rejected and the processes they have in place to correct bad calls.\n\n“Defensibility will become the new bar,” said Gogia.\n\n## Where AI hiring helps, where it hurts [...] ### The hot issues for CIOs at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\n\n### What CIOs can learn at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\n\n### What Oracle’s $300B OpenAI deal means for enterprise cloud strategy\n\n### Legacy federal government HR systems: A billion dollar problem, says Workday survey\n\n### Microsoft is set to hike its Power BI prices — will buyers jump ship or just take the hit?\n\n## Show me more\n\n### The new CDIO stack: Tech, talent and storytelling\n\nImage\n\n### The secret to a successful IT career development strategy\n\nImage\n\n### Why your ERP still can’t solve inventory drift — and the architecture that will\n\nImage\n\n### How Edward Don &amp; Co.

The Human Resources Professionals Association, for one, points to successful use of AI in initial talent sourcing, screening, and assessment, while AI scribes can quietly take notes, helping recruiters focus more intently on candidate discussions.\n\nGogia agreed that AI can filter and rank large applicant pools, automate repetitive HR tasks, and identify overlooked candidates within internal databases. This means hiring teams can move faster, hone their focus, be more consistent, and reduce friction.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech Trend #2: Unleashing agentic AI&#x27;s true potential&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Може би най-съществената промяна е разбирането, че агентите представляват нов тип работна сила – „силициева работна сила“. Организациите все по-често интегрират тези дигитални „служители“ с човешката работна сила, което позволява на хората да се съсредоточат върху дейности с по-висока добавена стойност като управление, съответствие с регулации и работа върху стратегии за растеж.\n\nMapfre, например, използва AI агенти за рутинни административни задачи при обработката на застрахователни претенции, като запазва човешкия фактор в по-чувствителни казуси, свързани с взаимодействие с клиенти. Moderna стига още по-далеч, обединявайки IT и HR функциите под ръководството на Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, за да постигне по-тясна интеграция между талант и технологии. [...] Perhaps the most significant change is the recognition of agents as a new category of labor - a “silicon-based workforce.” Organizations are increasingly integrating these digital workers with their human, or carbon-based, workforce, enabling people to focus on higher-value activities such as governance, compliance, and growth strategy. Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] ## New research from the Deloitte Tech Trends report reveals that while agentic artificial intelligence (AI) promises autonomous operations and intelligent execution, many enterprises are struggling to move beyond pilot projects. True value creation stems from fundamentally redesigning operations and managing AI agents as a “silicon-based workforce” that complements human talent—rather than simply automating existing processes.\n\nThe agentic reality gap: Bridging promise and practice&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Scale and grow with AI for manufacturing&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## The agentic era: What’s next?\n\nManufacturers are moving beyond task‑level automation toward a new operating model where AI works alongside teams to coordinate decisions, optimize workflows, and adapt to changing conditions in real time. This next era isn’t about experimenting on the margins, but about treating AI as a core capability that strengthens every part of the enterprise.\n\nPlatforms like Azure OpenAI, Microsoft Fabric, Foundry Models, and Microsoft 365 Copilot are already helping organizations make that shift. And the economic signal is strong. Forrester’s Total Economic Impact study attributes the financial upside of the broader Industrial AI value stack to improvements across operations, productivity, and supply chain performance: [...] Take Audi AG, a global automotive leader navigating rising internal demand for support and process guidance. To alleviate mounting human resources and IT strain, Audi launched its first AI-powered self-service assistant using Foundry that was deployed in just two weeks. The impact? Faster access to information, fewer routine queries, and more time for teams to focus on meaningful, high-value work. Audi’s example shows how AI doesn’t replace people but amplifies them.\n\n## The agentic era: What’s next? [...] ## Empowering people: AI as a workforce multiplier\n\nLabor shortages, rising workload complexity, and persistent training bottlenecks continue to stretch manufacturing teams thin. Many frontline and knowledge workers spend too much time searching for information, navigating outdated systems, or performing repetitive tasks that slow productivity and sap morale.\n\nBut AI is shifting this dynamic. Manufacturers are adopting intelligent assistants, predictive tools, and automated workflows that free employees to focus on higher‑value work. According to recent industry data, organizations are already seeing material gains:&quot;,

Mapfre, for example, deploys AI agents to handle routine administrative tasks in claims management, while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive customer interactions. Moderna has gone a step further by merging its technology and HR functions under a Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to better integrate talent and technology. [...] The shift toward agentic AI represents more than a technological evolution; it is a fundamental organizational transformation that will reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master agent-native process design, multi-agent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated economy. Ultimately, success will depend on creating new forms of human–AI collaboration that capitalize on the complementary strengths of both human and silicon-based workers.\n\nTo explore how organizations can strategically embrace agentic AI and prepare for the future of work, read the original article on the Deloitte Insights website.\n\nDid you find this useful?\n\n#### Thanks for your feedback [...] ## Tech Trends 2026 - Trend #2\n\nNew research from the Deloitte Tech Trends report reveals that while agentic artificial intelligence (AI) promises autonomous operations and intelligent execution, many enterprises are struggling to move beyond pilot projects.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How to get your enterprise architecture ready for agentic AI - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;According to Accenture’s latest Pulse of Changesurvey of 3,650 executives conducted late last year, 67% of executives said AI would substantially or completely transform their organization’s core. Some 15% said they’re working on agentic POCs, with 31% running pilots in specific functions, and 31% currently deploying agents across multiple functions.\n\nThis suggests that while agentic AI is a workplace reality, most organizations are at the start of their journey. To get beyond POCs and limited pilots, companies will need to adjust their infrastructure to support autonomous operations across system boundaries.\n\n3 critical upgrades and how to execute them\n\n1. Data quality requires new standards and guardrails [...] Credit: Lazy_Bear / Shutterstock \n\nAgentic AI works in a different way than the gen AI tools many enterprises have deployed over the past two years. Where ChatGPT-style assistants analyze data and recommend actions for humans to execute, agentic AI systems take multiple autonomous actions to achieve business goals. These systems access data across the front, middle, and back office, as well as to external sources. They break down historic functional silos to automate broader end-to-end value chains, without human intervention. [...] Action: Focus your integration investments on the systems that agents will orchestrate across most often. Working with clients, the ones we see most often include customer-facing operations, financial workflows, HR platforms, IT infrastructure, and compliance. But create agent-friendly APIs for these core paths first. Start with event-driven architectures that reveal not just data, but business context and rules that agents can understand autonomously. For time-critical value chains, consider deploying real-time data integration and event-based architecture patterns.\n\n3. Build a new architectural layer to enable autonomous operations\n\nOrganizations need to create an agent tier in their enterprise architecture. This is made up of:&quot;,

With AI adoption accelerating at unprecedented speeds, IT leaders are struggling to find and train the talent needed to manage automation, agentic AI, and next-gen security — all while battling burnout and shifting priorities.\nFrom the realities of automation to the cultural hurdles of change management, we explore whether finding the right skills is truly the top challenge for CIOs today — or if data, infrastructure, and security are even bigger obstacles.\n\nImage\n\n### Novanta CIO Sarah Betadam on managing risk around AI\n\nImage [...] Automate workflows, maintain compliance, and make faster, data-driven decisions in a single, integrated system.\n\n### Why your 2026 IT strategy needs an agentic constitution\n\nAI agents can’t read dusty SOP PDFs, so smart IT teams are encoding rules as code to let autonomy scale without losing control.\n\n### How adaptive infrastructure is evolving capabilities at the speed of business\n\nOld-school infrastructure can’t keep up with AI, so smart teams are breaking it into modular pieces that AI agents can reassemble on the fly.\n\n### 10 top priorities for CIOs in 2026\n\nA new year creates fresh opportunities — and challenges.

Agentic AI can plan, make decisions, and execute across end-to-end processes. That fundamentally changes how work gets done. [...] The biggest risk is optimising a model of work that is already becoming obsolete. Automating existing processes can deliver short-term efficiency gains, but it also reinforces legacy assumptions about roles, decision rights, and control structures.\n\nAgentic AI challenges those assumptions. It can coordinate work, adapt in real time, and operate across silos of humans and data in ways traditional hierarchies were never designed to support. Organisations that only automate end up layering AI on top of processes that no longer make sense, rather than redesigning how value is created. Reinvention requires leaders to rethink workflows, roles, and governance from the ground up, not simply make today’s model run faster. [...] Do not mistake automation for transformation. Agentic AI’s real value lies not in making existing work cheaper or faster, but in enabling organisations to rethink how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how leadership is exercised.\n\nLeaders who focus only on efficiency will capture incremental gains. Those who are willing to redesign their organisations around human–agent collaboration can unlock entirely new sources of value. That choice needs to be made deliberately, and sooner rather than later.\n\n## Explore our services\n\nScale AI for your business\n\n## Next Tech Agenda&quot;,

[...] #### Why unixifying Windows is a very bad idea\n\n    Powershell has a really ugly syntax and is ill-designed, but the worst was that management GUIs started to call powershell scripts instead of calling the underlying APIs directly. That made GUIs cumbersome, slow, and error mangament and reporting crippled.\n\n    GUI and CLI must be parallel - and both must call APIs. GUIs MUST not be built atop scripts - that&#x27;s one reason that made Unix far inferior to Windows, because its design is outdated.\n\n    Sure, it&#x27;s simpler to build an ugly scripltet that a well designed GUI, especually since MS since .NET also crippled GUI development tools and changed UI frameworks severtal times...\n\n    So instead of better systems we are running back to the 1970s.\n\n    1   1  Reply&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The whole concept of agentic AI is the ability to manage across multiple domains,” he said. “It’s like the next future evolution of integration. You need to have that orchestration layer to tie supply chains with financial agents, with HR agents and so forth. We work a lot with the enterprise architecture organizations to make sure that the guardrails are applied so that there’s a trust that there is the ability to validate the truth. This capability that Workato is providing provides that kind of service, based on their experiences of doing integration services.” [...] UPDATED 17:20 EST / AUGUST 22 2025\n\nArtificial intelligence is evolving fast with agentic AI taking it further by reasoning, adjusting and adapting in real time to get results.\n\nCapgemini LLC. offers Agentic AI for Enterprise, enabling organizations to embed autonomous AI agents into existing systems with governance, scalability and speed. Powered by Workato Inc.’s low-code/no-code platform, businesses can rapidly build, configure and manage purpose-specific AI agents, according to Al Liubinskas (pictured, left), vice president and NA cloud integration practice lead at Capgemini.\n\nCapgemini’s Al Liubinskas talks with theCUBE about the transformative impact of agentic AI. [...] Liubinskas and David Ng (right), vice president and partner of go to market and Alliances at Workato, spoke with theCUBE’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at the WOW: World of Workato event, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the importance of agentic AI in the enterprise and how Capgemini and Workato are turning it into reality. (\\ Disclosure below.)\n\n### Agentic AI acts as an intelligent conductor that orchestrates actions\n\nUnlike traditional AI that only generates outputs, agentic AI serves as an orchestration layer — coordinating, sequencing and managing actions across systems, tools and workflows. The Capgemini-Workato partnership is designed to bring this vision to life, according to Liubinskas.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI powers true end-to-end automation by replacing rigid workflows with adaptive, goal-driven orchestration. Unlike traditional automation that follows fixed rules, it acts as a proactive collaborator — sensing, deciding and acting across interconnected systems, Kompella pointed out. \n\n“Everybody wants to talk about agentic AI,” she said. “The technology promise means, first of all, end-to-end process automation experience, end-to-end seamless coordination between organizational processes — people, clients and employees. It’s possible because of the ability of memory, perception, reasoning, learning, which gives the ability to act and be decisive, which was not there in traditional automation technologies before.” [...] Agentic AI solutions elevate human potential by serving as collaborative, goal-driven partners. Rather than executing pre-defined tasks, the agents make decisions, adapt to change and proactively drive outcomes across sectors such as supply chain, warehousing and manufacturing, according to Lim. [...] “In the current world, the human resource, the people are the most important parts,” he said. “The robots and agents are actually strategic enablers to help us deliver the outcomes. With the AI agents in some of the places like warehousing, service supply networks, we have actually reduced the number of hours required from days to actually hours. For example, one of our key business experts was working previously in a warehouse environment performing more of the tasks in the warehouse itself. Now he has moved to become an analyst.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Transforming Financial Services with Agentic AI | Capgemini&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI is becoming a catalyst for legacy modernization by bridging the gap between outdated systems and future-ready architectures. By deploying intelligent agents that autonomously assess, transform, and validate legacy and mainframe systems, organizations can reduce dependency on scarce SMEs while improving accuracy and functional consistency. These agents bring contextual awareness and dynamic orchestration to legacy environments – streamlining data flows, optimizing processes, and enhancing interoperability across silos. This approach doesn’t just reduce technical debt: it also unlocks faster innovation cycles, allowing banks and insurers to modernize incrementally while delivering safer, smarter, and more adaptive services to clients. [...] Agentic AI is rapidly transforming the insurance value chain – bringing speed, intelligence, and efficiency to every touchpoint. In claims, it enables faster resolution through autonomous decisioning and real-time data synthesis. In underwriting, agentic systems dynamically assess risk with greater precision, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. Distribution is becoming more personalized and proactive, as agentic AI hyper-personalizes offerings to customer needs and behaviors. And in servicing, intelligent agents are enhancing responsiveness and accuracy, driving better customer experiences, while reducing operational costs. Together, these advancements are helping insurers unlock differentiated value, accelerate time to market, and build more resilient, adaptive businesses. [...] Agentic AI goes beyond generative chat: It employs agents that plan, act, and adapt across banking and insurance throughout the cloud modernization lifecycle\n Most financial services (FS) firms stall at pilots: Why? Because they’re worried about the ramifications of agent behaviors, they haven’t experienced it themselves and need someone who has guided others to implement at scale. Agentic AI in financial services reimagines business flows by enabling systems to make autonomous decisions, adapt in real time, and optimize outcomes across complex processes. A proven approach and platform accelerate time to value by aligning AI capabilities with clear business goals, reducing friction from experimentation to deployment.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI Tool: Modernize Legacy - Capgemini Switzerland&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Capgemini, we have developed an innovative approach that takes advantage of agentic AI coding agents to significantly reduce the time needed to modernize legacy applications.\n\nOur AI agent tool – a sophisticated multi-agent system – is purpose-built to make legacy systems future-safe. We have designed it to support software teams in migrating custom-built applications from outdated technology stacks to modern platforms.\n\nAt the heart of the solution is the orchestration of a collaborative team of AI agents. This allows development teams to automate a large portion of the modernization process (see figure 2), resulting in a far more efficient, scalable approach to modernizing and migrating software. [...] The instructions transfer Capgemini’s deep expertise to the agent, both in understanding the legacy system and in designing the target software architecture. They also determine the specific role each AI agent is assigned in the migration.\n\nSo that the transition runs smoothly, the roles of these AI agents mirror those in a human development team migrating a legacy application (see figure 3). A software developer agent analyzes the existing source code and rewrites it using the target technology. A testing or quality assurance (QA) agent then validates the code against predefined test cases. If any tests fail, the QA agent provides detailed error messages and returns the code to the developer for revision. [...] ##### Jun 9, 2025\n\n## Capgemini’s innovative AI agent tool is helping organizations in the public sector and beyond to reduce the cost and time of modernizing their legacy applications\n\nFor years, and across industries, rapid developments in digitalization have been creating challenges for companies around adapting to technological change. Particularly challenging are “legacy issues” such as outdated applications or obsolete software that need transferring to current technologies to stay maintainable.\n\nThis has unfortunately resulted in us talking about legacy modernization for so long that the first modernizations are already due to be modernized again.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Agentic AI is Transforming Enterprise Platforms | BCG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How Organizations Are Using Agentic AI to Make an Impact\n\nBusinesses across industries and functions are integrating agentic AI into a variety of workflows, sometimes leveraging platforms such as Salesforce’s Einstein AI and AgentForce platforms, which use predictive analytics and automation to enhance sales, marketing, and customer service workflows. In addition, ServiceNow’s AI agents and Now Assist capabilities are automating IT, HR, and operational processes, reducing manual workloads by up to 60%. Workflows that are successfully using agentic AI are even found in areas such as finance and fraud detection. The results are impressive, including the following: [...] Weekly Insights Subscription \n\n### Stay ahead with BCG insights on digital, technology, and data\n\n Subscribe \n\nManage Subscriptions\n\nAI agents are not just improving workflows; they’re redefining how businesses operate. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, generative AI, and autonomous systems, augmented by a proliferation of enterprise data from digital devices and collaboration tools, have dramatically increased their ability to handle complex decision making in real time. As a result, these intelligent virtual assistants are transforming core technology platforms like CRM, ERP, and HR from relatively static systems to dynamic ecosystems that can analyze data and make decisions without human intervention, optimizing and adapting instantaneously. [...] Confronting Implementation Challenges\n\nThe three biggest challenges that companies encounter as they take on agentic AI transformations center on talent, quick wins, and the use of legacy technologies.\n\nFinding and Developing the Right Talent.Agentic AI requires a mix of advanced technical talent such as AI-prompt engineers, AI or machine language specialists, and data engineers as well as business translators who can map AI use cases to workflows. Most organizations underestimate this need. For example, an insurer that is setting up an AI innovation team may initially staff it with only the existing data-scientist team; however, it will quickly realize it needs domain experts who understand claims processing in depth and must embed them into the team to gain traction.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One leading global beauty brand exemplifies what can be achieved when a company fully embraces AI’s potential. The brand’s customer insights showed that, due to the huge number of products on the market, 70% of customers feel overwhelmed by decision paralysis.\n\nBCG worked with this brand to develop a first-of-its-kind agentic AI that leverages millions of unique data points to deliver a highly personalized consumer experience. The agent draws on information about more than 750 products and a library of 150,000 dermatologist-annotated images to generate tailored recommendations.\n\nAt the same time, the agent gathers valuable insights from user interactions, capturing nuanced consumer preferences and sentiments expressed during chats, all while ensuring user privacy. [...] For consumer goods companies, the message is clear: those without an explicit, AI-first strategic roadmap risk falling significantly behind their competitors. Leading companies aren’t just thinking about consumer-facing AI-enabled executions—they’re looking to reshape end-to-end functions and workflows across each part of the business. And they’re hiring top talent for roles that rely on judgement, strategic insight, and human-agent collaboration.\n\nConsumer products companies taking full advantage of AI also tend to set aside dedicated funding for AI initiatives, typically allocating around 20% of their organization’s IT budget, with business units given autonomy to own and deploy AI solutions with increased speed and independence. [...] An AI-first model supports innovation across the product lifecycle, from the ideas stage—where AI can speed up the insights-to-innovation process by up to five times—to the evaluation stage, where AI can provide leadership with product performance analysis up to 60% faster.\n\nTo learn more about building AI-first, market-leading consumer goods strategies, click here.\n\n## Related Content\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nBy embedding agentic AI directly into daily workflows, one global industrial goods company unlocked agility, resilience, and a 2 percentage-point EBITDA boost in just two years.\n\nHealth Care Industry\n\nBCG partnered with one global pharmaceutical company to transform medical writing and accelerate biopharma development.\n\nLearn More&quot;,
