  <li><strong>Workday to Invest CAD $1 Billion in Canada Over Five Years (Published 2026-01-20):</strong>
    <p>Workday has announced an ambitious investment of CAD $1 billion to be allocated over five years in Canada. This includes expanding its Vancouver HQ, building new data centers, and increasing R&D focused on AI in regulated industries. The move demonstrates Workday’s deepening focus on AI-rich innovations and secure, compliant regional services for customers in highly regulated spaces. For Deloitte teams, this opens concrete co-innovation opportunities and positions Workday for leadership in Canadian cloud-native HCM/ERP transformations. It also strategically places Workday in contention for large-scale government and FSI contracts where data residency and AI ethics are critical.

  <li><strong>ServiceNow Partners with OpenAI to Develop and Deploy Enterprise-Grade AI Agents (Published 2026-01-20):</strong>
    <p>ServiceNow and OpenAI have launched a new partnership aimed at building advanced enterprise AI agents capable of reasoning, interacting, and acting autonomously within business workflows. The first release will target HR, knowledge management, and ITSM, raising the baseline for AI-driven workflow automation. The move places pressure on Workday and partners to respond with safer, more effective, and tightly-governed agentic AI experiences. Deloitte practitioners should anticipate increased client demand for integrated agent enablement, end-to-end workflow coverage, and interoperability across SaaS platforms.

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow:</strong> Their new OpenAI partnership leapfrogs routine AI workflow bots to deliver reasoning agents for workflow, HR, and ITSM. <em>Implication:</em> Workday’s next moves should ensure agility, breadth of agentic workflow, and integration depth. <br/>Deloitte must prioritize integrated agentic AI workflow designs to meet rising client expectations. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/servicenow-partners-openai-develop-deploy-enterprise-grade-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Details</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>SAP, Oracle, UKG:</strong> No new major 24h releases, but Workday’s new Canadian investment increases pressure, especially in public sector and compliance-driven verticals. <em>Implication:</em> Highlight Workday’s resilience, compliance, and local data capabilities as a differentiator. (<a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-20-Workday-to-Invest-CAD-1-Billion-in-Canada-Over-Five-Years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Details</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday and Microsoft Unified AI Agent Experience:</strong> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a><br/>Outcome: Master the end-to-end orchestration of AI-driven workflows spanning HR, finance, and productivity platforms for integrated client impact.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Risk Management and Responsible AI in Workday Implementations:</strong> <a href="https://airc.nist.gov/docs/workday-success-story.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a><br/>Outcome: Teams will consistently deliver and evidence responsible, transparent AI/agentic process deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update messaging and sales assets for the Canadian market to spotlight Workday’s innovation, investment, and regulatory alignment.</li>
  <li>Develop competitive AI/agentic solution playbooks for delivering against ServiceNow–OpenAI, SAP, and Oracle proposals.</li>
  <li>Host internal briefings on ServiceNow–OpenAI partnership and alignment with Workday AI/agentic roadmap.</li>
  <li>Accelerate enablement on unified AI agent solutions and responsible agent deployment across Workday and Microsoft ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unmanaged AI agentic deployment risk:</strong> Accelerating agent rollouts without robust governance can expose clients to safety and ethical lapses. <br/>Mitigation: Deploy formal risk management with reference to Workday and NIST frameworks; mandatory enablement on responsible AI.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive escalation and client churn risk:</strong> Fast-maturing agentic AI rivals (ServiceNow-OpenAI, SAP, Oracle) can raise client attrition risk. <br/>Mitigation: Double down on differentiated strengths—compliance, cloud locality, Microsoft integration; arm teams with migration and value case materials.</li>

Strategic focus should be on harnessing these advancements for client outcomes while mitigating deployment risks.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday to Invest CAD $1 Billion in Canada Over Five Years (Published 2026-01-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced plans to invest CAD $1 billion in Canada over the next five years, focusing on AI and innovation hubs. This substantial investment is set to expand Workday’s Vancouver headquarters and establish new data centers and R&amp;D capacity. The initiative highlights Workday’s commitment to scaling AI-powered solutions and supporting clients in regulated industries, signaling a strategic prioritization of North American market expansion and technical leadership. \\n\\nThe investment is significant for Workday clients and partners—including Deloitte—because it increases capacity for AI research, improves cloud service resilience for Canadian and cross-border clients, and aligns with demands for data residency and compliance in the region. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the expanded regional footprint offers new opportunities for co-innovation and go-to-market activity in AI-enabled HCM, financials, and adaptive planning. The investment also indicates a competitive posture against SAP, Oracle, and UKG in Canada and positions Workday to capture large government and FSI contracts that demand sovereign cloud and robust AI governance. \\n\\nOverall, Workday’s move signals its intent to lead on AI-native SaaS and cloud data sovereignty, creating near-term delivery and consulting opportunities as clients modernize HCM and ERP environments with agentic AI and localized service models.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-20-Workday-to-Invest-CAD-1-Billion-in-Canada-Over-Five-Years\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow Partners with OpenAI to Develop and Deploy Enterprise-Grade AI Agents (Published 2026-01-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow and OpenAI announced a partnership to co-develop a suite of enterprise-grade AI agents for IT service management, HR, and operations. The collaboration aims to integrate generative and agentic AI capabilities directly into ServiceNow&#x27;s workflow automation, offering agents that can reason, interact with humans, and execute actions autonomously. The initial roadmap prioritizes HR case acceleration, knowledge base curation, and workflow orchestration.\\n\\nFor the broader SaaS ecosystem, this partnership demonstrates growing focus on advanced and autonomous AI in workplace automation—directly relevant to areas Workday and its partners are addressing, including agentic workflow and skills intelligence. The move intensifies competition with other platform players and accelerates ecosystem convergence on agentic, verticalized AI functions. Enterprises will gain access to more powerful, context-aware automation—which highlights the importance for Deloitte’s Workday teams to articulate and build expertise around agentic AI integration, interoperability, and responsible use across Workday and adjoining platforms.\\n\\nThe implication for Workday clients and consulting partners is that the bar for AI agent effectiveness, safety, and end-to-end workflow integration is rising. It is not sufficient to embed isolated AI helpers—clients expect holistic, governed agentic experiences. Working in alignment with these developments ensures competitive parity and risk mitigation for Workday consulting.\&quot;, \n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/servicenow-partners-openai-develop-deploy-enterprise-grade-ai-agents\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI to deliver next-gen agentic AI in enterprise workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow’s alignment with OpenAI signals a rapid acceleration toward embedded, reasoning-capable AI for HR and operations. For Workday and its consulting partners, this raises both expectations and direct competition in the agentic AI space—pressuring faster, safer, and more tightly-integrated agent deployments for use cases like HR service delivery and ITSM.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Nigeria&#x27;s Cybersecurity Outlook 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Crucially, these threats are no longer confined to large organisations. Small and medium-sized businesses, schools, hospitals, and government agencies are increasingly targeted, especially where security resources/budget is limited. Building resilience does not always require complex solutions. Consistent staff awareness, stronger account protection, basic monitoring for unusual activity, and clear recovery plans can significantly reduce impact. Organisations that prepare early are far more likely to recover quickly. Those that assume they are unlikely targets may find that a single convincing message is enough to cause serious disruption.\n\n##### Agentic AI: The Ambivalent Tool [...] ##### Agentic AI: The Ambivalent Tool\n\nA new class of artificial intelligence, often referred to as Agentic AI, is beginning to reshape the technology landscape. Unlike earlier systems designed to support specific tasks, these tools can operate more independently — breaking down objectives, making decisions, and taking actions with limited human input. [...] The increased autonomy of Agentic AI means it can be used in both beneficial and malicious ways. Agentic AI can be highly valuable and potentially dangerous (in the wrong hands). On the defensive side, it can monitor environments continuously, identify unusual behaviour in real time, and respond far more quickly than traditional processes allow. Used well, this can significantly improve detection accuracy and response speedby learning from evolving threat patterns and adapting controls dynamically. However, the same capabilities can alsobe exploited. Attackers could deploy autonomous AI to identify weaknesses, generate convincing fake content, and execute multi-stage intrusions with minimal human oversight and speeds that outpace conventional defences.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The company’s AI agents automate workflows for housing providers across approximately 1 in 6 apartments in the US and healthcare providers nationwide. With over 400 employees and growing recurring revenue 100%+ year over year, EliseAI has established itself as one of NYC’s most promising and fastest-growing tech companies. [...] # EliseAI Expands NYC Footprint With Lease at Iconic Former Tiffany &amp; Co. Building on Fifth Avenue\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 20, 2026--\n\nEliseAI, the leading AI startup automating complex housing and healthcare systems, announced today the signing of a 10-year lease agreement with Chetrit Organization at 401 Fifth Avenue, establishing the building as its New York headquarters.\n\nLocated on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 37th Street, 401 Fifth Avenue is a landmark Midtown office building spanning eight floors and 240,000 square feet. EliseAI will occupy approximately 109,000 square feet, moving just a few blocks to expand its midtown New York headquarters more than 1.5x, reflecting its dynamic growth and long-term commitment to the city. [...] “We are very pleased to welcome this prominent tenant to multiple floors of our Fifth Avenue property,” said Juda Chetrit and Michael Chetrit of The Chetrit Organization. “Their presence brings new energy to the corridor and underscores the continued transformation of the area, particularly as it emerges as a hub for innovative, AI-driven companies. With neighbors like Amazon, Fifth Avenue is clearly entering an exciting new chapter.”\n\nEliseAI was represented by Evan Margolin, Valentin Stobetsky, Calum Waddell, Will McGarry and Hale King from JLL in the transaction. Chetrit Organization was represented by Brian Waterman, David Waterman and Alex Kesseler from Newmark, who serve as the exclusive leasing agents for the property.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Five AI Agent Predictions for 2026: The Year Enterprises ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By mid-2026, the question won&#x27;t be whether enterprises should embed AI agents in business processes—it will be what they&#x27;re waiting for if they haven&#x27;t already. DIY pilot projects will increasingly be viewed as a risker alternative to embedded pre-built capabilities that support day-to-day work. We&#x27;re seeing the first wave of natively embedded agents within Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications across finance, HR, supply chain, and customer experience. This isn&#x27;t bolted-on AI – it’s built-in. These agents live directly within workflows where work happens. [...] For some, AI expertise once meant expensive specialists and lengthy implementation cycles. That&#x27;s evaporating. Next year, business managers across finance, HR, and supply chain teams will directly create and modify AI agents using intuitive templates and interfaces and low code development tools. This democratisation represents a fundamental shift in competitive advantage. [...] This means adopting the consume-configure-build hierarchy: first activate prebuilt agents embedded in your applications, then configure them for specific processes, before you consider building a custom solution. It means establishing clear baseline metrics and KPI targets before activation, then measuring rigorously afterwards to demonstrate tangible ROI. Start with high-volume, high-impact processes where agents deliver immediate, measurable value. Speed of adoption, not sophistication of implementation, will separate market leaders from laggards in 2026.\n\n## The Moment Has Arrived\n\nThe business case for AI is undeniable. The remaining question isn&#x27;t whether AI agents will transform your industry—they will. The question is whether you&#x27;ll lead that transformation or play catch-up.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Google Has Entered The Contact Center Chat&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Similarly on the commerce side, it would be easy to write this off as another “agentic commerce” offering. Announcements of exclusive partnerships between commerce or payments vendors and answer engines (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity) seem to come daily. It’s worth noting that although Google and others claim to have agentic solutions, “agentic commerce” is an often inaccurately used term. Most likely, “agentic” refers to the use of agents to execute direct requests from users/customers, such as finding products that match a query. These are assistive, conversational experiences and are less likely to act autonomously, which is the requirement for the “agentic” moniker.\n\n### What’s Actually New [...] Forrester Logo\n\n# Google Has Entered The Contact Center Chat\n\nColleen Fazio, Senior Analyst\n\nEmily Pfeiffer, Principal Analyst\n\nKate Leggett, Vice President, Principal Analyst\n\nAt the recent NRF event, the headline was shopping in answer engines, with Google’s new Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience and Universal Commerce Protocol getting lots of attention. Tucked below the fold, however, was important news for CX and contact center leaders: the announcement of Google Cloud’s Customer Experience Agent Studio. [...] Customer service and CX leaders would be forgiven if they glossed over this latest announcement from Google. Many of the customer service features it announced are practically table stakes for contact-center-as-a-service vendors, such as providing real-time contextual guidance to live reps and real-time QA.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Microsoft 365 Copilot and agents help tackle the infinite workday | Microsoft 365 Blog&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI can now reason and solve complex problems in truly remarkable ways, giving every business intelligence on demand that will rewrite the rules of business and transform knowledge work as we know it. Traditionally, companies have hired more employees or tapped more capital (financing, infrastructure, equipment) to increase output. Now, they can add digital labor in the form of reasoning agents to the mix. [...] In our review, we saw that nearly one in three employees say it’s impossible to keep up with today’s pace of work. At a time when knowledge work has reached peak inefficiency, AI can be a lifeline—but it’s only part of the solution. Now is the time for leaders to rethink how work and teams are structured or risk accelerating a broken system. That means focusing on the 20% of work that drives 80% of the impact; designing flatter, more agile teams around the work chart, not the org chart; and reskilling every employee to be an agent boss.\n\nTry Copilot Chat today [...] Analyst thinks like a skilled data scientist, so your team can go from raw data to insights in minutes. Your team can use it to assess how discounts affect customer behavior, identify top customers who aren’t fully using products they’ve purchased, and visualize product sentiment and usage trends to inform go-to-market decisions.\n\n## 3.

Has anyone deployed M365 Copilot Integration with Salesforce or Workday using Copilot Studio? I have not but wanted to note that Power Apps may be useful but Copilot Studio I believe was the replacement or rebranding for Power Virtual Agents so that may be more of the skillset needed. ### Resources.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Microsoft Entra ID and Workday integration reference - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Microsoft Entra ID sends the following Get\\_Workers Workday Web Services request to retrieve worker data. The query looks up the Workday transaction log for all effective dated worker entries as of the time corresponding to the full sync run.\n\n```\n          Hire Employee   Contract Contingent Worker      2021-01-19T02:29:16.0094202Z 2021-01-19T02:29:16.0094202Z 30   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   \n```\n\nThe Response\\_Group node is used to specify which worker attributes to fetch from Workday. For a description of each flag in the Response\\_Group node, refer to the Workday Get\\_Workers API documentation. [...] It&#x27;s January 15, 2023 and Jane Doe is employed as a contingent worker. HR offers Jane a full-time position.\n The terms of Jane&#x27;s contract change require backdating the transaction so it aligns with the start of the current month. HR initiates a backdated worker conversion transaction Workday on January 15, 2023 with effective date as January 1, 2023. Now there are two worker profiles in Workday for Jane. The CW profile is inactive, while the FTE profile is active.\n The Microsoft Entra provisioning service detects this change in the Workday transaction log on January 15, 2023. The service automatically provision attributes of the new FTE profile in the next sync cycle.\n No changes are required in the provisioning app configuration to handle this scenario. [...] ### Workday test connection query\n\nTo test connectivity to Workday, Microsoft Entra ID sends the following Get\\_Workers Workday Web Services request.\n\n```\n       2021-01-19T02:28:50.1491022Z 2021-01-19T02:28:50.1491022Z   true true true   2021-01-19T02:28:50.1491022Z 2021-01-19T02:28:50.1491022Z 1 1   1 1   \n```\n\n## How full sync works\n\nFull sync in the context of Workday-driven provisioning refers to the process of fetching all identities from Workday and determining what provisioning rules to apply to each worker object. Full sync happens when you turn on provisioning for the first time and also when you restart provisioning either from the Microsoft Entra admin center or using Graph APIs.&quot;,

Nonetheless, Workday (and HiredScore, prior to Workday’s acquisition of HiredScore) routinely conducts bias testing of its AI products that have the potential to significantly impact individuals’ economic opportunities. While Workday engaged an external consultant to conduct the bias testing of the Spotlight AI tool using the impact ratio approach as described in the NYC Law, the purpose of this testing is in furtherance of Workday/HiredScore’s commitments to identify and mitigate potential bias. Customers may need to conduct their own evaluation, testing and/or bias audits depending on their legal obligations. [...] HiredScore’s explainable AI outputs report to what extent a candidate’s application matches the job requirements using a simple A, B, C, D system, where A denotes the highest match between a candidate’s application and an employer-defined job requisition. Put another way, the technology acts like a “smart mirror” reflecting back the extent to which candidates fit the job requirements set by the employer. The A, B, C, D scores are never “curved.” This means that if a job requisition has commonly held requirements, there may be many more As and Bs than Cs and Ds. Conversely, if a job requisition has very uncommonly held requirements, there may be many more Cs and Ds than As and Bs, and each candidate will receive a score indicating how they align with the requirements; this score is [...] Designing and building responsible AI that our customers can trust and adopt in line with their legal compliance obligations has been part of HiredScore’s mission statement since the beginning.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Oracle Cloud HCM vs. Workday: 5 things to know | oraclehcm&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Given that Workday’s 24 R2 release is scheduled for September 2024, it should just barely make its own timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle Cloud HCM made a clear announcement regarding its generative AI plans and use cases in June 2023. As of its first release in 2024, Oracle Cloud HCM customers have had access to embedded generative AI functionality that help customers improve decision making and enhance the employee experience. These include knowledgebase articles, job postings, performance feedback and development tips, and review summaries. It also includes many use cases that Workday has not announced on its roadmap, like a candidate experience summary, job category landing pages, and job match explanations. [...] Then co-CEO Carl Eschenbach first discussed preliminary plans for generative AI in March 2023. Workday’s generative AI use cases were clarified at Workday Rising in September 2023, talking about functionality such as job descriptions and employee growth plans. Plans for availability were set for 6-12 months from the event, or between March and September 2024. As of March 2024, Workday confirmed that there were three HCM use cases in an early adopter program as of its 24 R1 release, with none scheduled for general availability until the 24 R2 release or later. Workday subsequently put a fourth HCM use case into early adopter program during its DevCon 2024 event, with no clear plans for general availability. [...] Overall, Workday only has 25 generative AI use cases on its roadmap, while Oracle Fusion Applications have 50+ embedded use cases.\n\nThe innovation comparison is substantial. While Oracle Cloud HCM customers are benefiting from increased productivity, Workday users are made to wait.\n\n## 4. Deliver a personalized and meaningful experience to every employee&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Everyday moments make or break organizational resilience&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Employees are grappling with shifting workplace norms and external anxieties all at once. One notable example is the shift in return to office mandates. Many organizations have shifted from three mandatory days in office to four or five, which is causing some employees to uproot the routines and lives they’ve built and nurtured in the last six years. AI also brings some anxieties around job security and changes in the nature of work. Economic uncertainty further compounds these challenges, as workers seek stability and clarity in their roles. [...] I&#x27;d like to receive an email from a leader to start a conversation.\n\nI have read and accept the privacy statement and terms of use.\\\n\nI would like Deloitte to keep me informed about related content. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nConstant disruption weighs on today’s workforce as employees face economic uncertainty, return to office, and AI. And that weight will only continue to get heavier with the increasing velocity of these changes. Resilience will be a key determinant of which companies succeed and which ones fall to disruption. [...] ### Build a resilient workforce today\n\nOrganizations must look at resilience from two angles: zoomed in and zoomed out. Zooming into key moments, look at how your people feel and behave. Do your leaders create strong interpersonal connections, inclusivity, and a sense of hope? Or do they cast blame and spark doubt?\n\nZooming out, look at your organization’s learning, leadership, culture, and equity programs. Do they foster the behaviours you want to see, or do they need a refresh?\n\nIf you focus too much on one perspective, your success will be limited. You need to take both lenses to your organization to really feel confident that your organization will be resilient through the uncertain times ahead.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Enterprises want OpenAI intelligence applied directly into ServiceNow workflows,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer. “Looking ahead, customers are especially interested in agentic and multimodal experiences, so they can work with AI like a true teammate inside ServiceNow.”\n\nThe pact is the latest sign that AI agents, independent bots that can take action on behalf of humans, are becoming standard inside core business software. Salesforce has already folded AI agents into its flagship sales and marketing tools. SAP and Workday have been similarly pitching businesses on the idea that their embedded AI agents are essential to getting value out of AI.

By reducing alert fatigue and background noise, AI allows security teams to focus on what truly matters. Ultimately, the advantage will not come from technology alone, but from how well organisations integrate it with human insight. When balanced correctly, this partnership enables faster responses without sacrificing control or understanding.\n\n##### Zero Trust and Identity- Focused Defence will Increasingly Become the New Baseline [...] Phishing campaigns, in particular, are becoming more convincing. With the help of AI, attackers can generate emails, messages, and voice notes that closely resemble communication from trusted colleagues, banks, suppliers, or regulators. Once attackers gain access to a user’s account, ransomware operators can move quickly — not just to lock systems but to quietly steal customer data, threaten exposure, and pressure organisations into paying ransoms. Recent incidents in banks, fintech firms, and government agencies demonstrate that this pattern is already emerging locally, often spreading faster than teams can respond.&quot;,

Employers are starting to experiment with AI interviewers that conduct phone interviews at times that work best for candidates. Gartner’s 3Q25 survey shows that 9% of candidates have completed an interview with AI, with AI interviews being more common in technology (15%), telecommunications (12%) and professional services (11%).&quot;,

By viewing each new technology vendor as a strategic partnership, they open the path to future growth.\n\nHere&#x27;s how tech investments support scalability in everyday practice: [...] Start by evaluating your current capabilities and constraints. Consider where you already have momentum, where systems and talent can sustain more demand, and where targeted investment will unlock the most progress.\n\nMost importantly: Know that growth leaders don’t scale by chasing every opportunity. Instead, they act with intention and prioritize the moves that align to the strengths and unique goals of their business.\n\nAI represents a huge opportunity for SMBs to gain a competitive advantage—but just 7% are currently scaling their AI operations effectively. Learn four ways that you can leverage AI to gain major business benefits.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Voice of the Employee: Addressing Burnout Risk\n\nRead Now\n\nShare this Perspective\n\n4.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Everyday moments make or break organizational resilience&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Employees are grappling with shifting workplace norms and external anxieties all at once. One notable example is the shift in return to office mandates. Many organizations have shifted from three mandatory days in office to four or five, which is causing some employees to uproot the routines and lives they’ve built and nurtured in the last six years. AI also brings some anxieties around job security and changes in the nature of work. Economic uncertainty further compounds these challenges, as workers seek stability and clarity in their roles. [...] I&#x27;d like to receive an email from a leader to start a conversation.\n\nI have read and accept the privacy statement and terms of use.\\\n\nI would like Deloitte to keep me informed about related content. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nConstant disruption weighs on today’s workforce as employees face economic uncertainty, return to office, and AI. And that weight will only continue to get heavier with the increasing velocity of these changes. Resilience will be a key determinant of which companies succeed and which ones fall to disruption.

AI can reduce the time spent on interview scheduling, help to provide a consistent interview experience and shorten the overall time to hire.\n\nThe newest frontier in an AI-driven hiring process is AI interview agents. Employers are starting to experiment with AI interviewers that conduct phone interviews at times that work best for candidates. Gartner’s 3Q25 survey shows that 9% of candidates have completed an interview with AI, with AI interviews being more common in technology (15%), telecommunications (12%) and professional services (11%).&quot;,

Of the more than 800 Glassdoor Community members surveyed, 67% said their main motivation for securing a side hustle was to increase their income, followed by a career pivot, passion project or for skill building.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Employees are grappling with shifting workplace norms and external anxieties all at once. One notable example is the shift in return to office mandates. Many organizations have shifted from three mandatory days in office to four or five, which is causing some employees to uproot the routines and lives they’ve built and nurtured in the last six years. AI also brings some anxieties around job security and changes in the nature of work. Economic uncertainty further compounds these challenges, as workers seek stability and clarity in their roles.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Enterprises want OpenAI intelligence applied directly into ServiceNow workflows,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer. “Looking ahead, customers are especially interested in agentic and multimodal experiences, so they can work with AI like a true teammate inside ServiceNow.”\n\nThe pact is the latest sign that AI agents, independent bots that can take action on behalf of humans, are becoming standard inside core business software. Salesforce has already folded AI agents into its flagship sales and marketing tools. SAP and Workday have been similarly pitching businesses on the idea that their embedded AI agents are essential to getting value out of AI.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Everyday moments make or break organizational resilience&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Employees are grappling with shifting workplace norms and external anxieties all at once. One notable example is the shift in return to office mandates. Many organizations have shifted from three mandatory days in office to four or five, which is causing some employees to uproot the routines and lives they’ve built and nurtured in the last six years. AI also brings some anxieties around job security and changes in the nature of work. Economic uncertainty further compounds these challenges, as workers seek stability and clarity in their roles.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;##### Agentic AI: The Ambivalent Tool\n\nA new class of artificial intelligence, often referred to as Agentic AI, is beginning to reshape the technology landscape. Unlike earlier systems designed to support specific tasks, these tools can operate more independently — breaking down objectives, making decisions, and taking actions with limited human input. [...] Crucially, these threats are no longer confined to large organisations. Small and medium-sized businesses, schools, hospitals, and government agencies are increasingly targeted, especially where security resources/budget is limited. Building resilience does not always require complex solutions. Consistent staff awareness, stronger account protection, basic monitoring for unusual activity, and clear recovery plans can significantly reduce impact. Organisations that prepare early are far more likely to recover quickly. Those that assume they are unlikely targets may find that a single convincing message is enough to cause serious disruption.\n\n##### Agentic AI: The Ambivalent Tool [...] The increased autonomy of Agentic AI means it can be used in both beneficial and malicious ways. Agentic AI can be highly valuable and potentially dangerous (in the wrong hands). On the defensive side, it can monitor environments continuously, identify unusual behaviour in real time, and respond far more quickly than traditional processes allow. Used well, this can significantly improve detection accuracy and response speedby learning from evolving threat patterns and adapting controls dynamically. However, the same capabilities can alsobe exploited. Attackers could deploy autonomous AI to identify weaknesses, generate convincing fake content, and execute multi-stage intrusions with minimal human oversight and speeds that outpace conventional defences.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;particularly with the EU AI Act on the horizon. Correlating AI interactions and DLP alerts in Microsoft Sentinel using Purview Audit (specifically the CopilotInteraction logs) data allows for real-time responses. Automated SOAR playbooks can then trigger protective actions - such as revoking an Agent ID - if an entity attempts to access sensitive HR or financial data. Final Thoughts Securing AI at scale is an architectural shift. By layering Identity, Session Governance, and Agentic Identity, AI moves from being a fragmented risk to a governed tool that actually works for the modern workplace. [...] Protection with IRM rounds this out by enforcing encryption and usage rights on the files themselves. When a user tries to print a \&quot;Do Not Print\&quot; document, Purview triggers an alert that flows into Microsoft Sentinel. This gives the SOC visibility into actual policy violations instead of them having to hunt through generic activity logs. 5. The “Agentic” Era: Agent 365 &amp; Sharing Controls Now that we&#x27;re moving from \&quot;Chat\&quot; to \&quot;Agents\&quot;, Agent 365 and Entra Agent ID provide the necessary identity and control plane for autonomous entities. A quick tip: in large-scale tenants, default settings often present a governance risk. A critical first step is navigating to the Microsoft 365 admin center (Copilot &gt; Agents) to disable the default “Anyone in organization” sharing option. Restricting agent [...] “Anyone in organization” sharing option. Restricting agent creation and sharing to a validated security group is essential to prevent unvetted agent sprawl and ensure that only compliant agents are discoverable. 6. The Human Layer: “Safe Harbors” over Bans Security fails when it creates more friction than the risk it seeks to mitigate. Instead of an outright ban, investment in AI skilling-teaching users context minimization (redacting specifics before interacting with a model) - is the better path. Providing a sanctioned, enterprise-grade \&quot;Safe Harbor\&quot; like M365 Copilot offers a superior tool that naturally cuts down the use of Shadow AI. 7. Continuous Ops: Monitoring &amp; Regulatory Audit Security is not a “set and forget” project, particularly with the EU AI Act on the horizon. Correlating&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;ServiceNow, which sells software that automates and manages various business workflows, primarily in information technology service management, customer service and human resources, is one of a number of enterprise software companies pushing the agentic AI narrative. Salesforce Inc. has made AI agents a core part of its flagship sales and marketing platforms, while SAP SE and Workday Inc. have rolled out AI agents that can automate various business processes. These companies all stress the same idea: Embedded AI agents are key to generating real value from AI. [...] UPDATED 20:29 EST / JANUARY 20 2026\n\n### ServiceNow partners with OpenAI to develop and deploy enterprise-grade AI agents\n\nby  Mike Wheatley\n\nEnterprise software giant ServiceNow Inc. has inked a three-year deal with OpenAI Group PBC so it can integrate the ChatGPT maker’s most advanced artificial intelligence models into its platforms.\n\nThe terms of the contract were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that it includes a revenue commitment from ServiceNow. The exact value of the deal will be determined by how many customers end up using OpenAI’s models inside ServiceNow’s platforms. [...] OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap said the deal is primarily about agentic AI, the autonomous, independent bots powered by AI that can perform work on behalf of humans with minimal supervision. “ServiceNow is helping enterprises bring agentic AI into workflows that are secure, scalable and designed to deliver measurable outcomes,” he said. “With OpenAI frontier models and multimodal capabilities in ServiceNow, enterprises across every industry will benefit from intelligence that handles work end-to-end in even the most complex environments.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Businesses are deploying AI agents faster than safety ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;But early studies like Deloitte&#x27;s new State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report point to what could very well become a dangerous divide between deployment and safety as industries scale up their use of agents and other powerful AI tools.\n\nAlso: 96% of IT pros say AI agents are a security risk, but they&#x27;re deploying them anyway\n\nFor now, oversight should be the watchword: Businesses need to be aware of the risks associated with their internal use of agents, and have policies and procedures in place to ensure they don&#x27;t go off the rails -- and, if they do, that the resulting harm can be managed. [...] ## What could go wrong?\n\nCompanies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Salesforce have marketed agents as productivity-boosting tools, with the core idea that businesses can offload repetitive, low-stakes workplace operations to them while human employees focus on more important tasks.\n\nAlso: Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster\n\nGreater autonomy, however, brings greater risk. Unlike more limited chatbots, which require careful and constant prompting, agents can interact with various digital tools to, for example, sign documents or make purchases on behalf of organizations. This leaves more room for error, since agents can behave in unexpected ways -- sometimes with disastrous consequences -- and be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.\n\n## Zoom out [...] # Businesses are deploying AI agents faster than safety protocols can keep up, Deloitte says\n\nscreenshot-2025-05-12-at-1-39-48pm.png\nblurred moving fast\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\n### ZDNET&#x27;s key takeaways\n\nBusinesses are ramping up their use of AI agents faster than they&#x27;re building adequate guardrails, according to Deloitte&#x27;s latest State of AI in the Enterprise report.\n\nPublished on Wednesday and based on a survey of over 3,200 business leaders across 24 countries, the study found that 23% of companies are currently using AI agents \&quot;at least moderately,\&quot; but that this figure is projected to jump to 74% in the next two years. In contrast, the portion of companies that report not using them at all, currently 25%, is expected to shrink to just 5%.&quot;,

To support autonomous AI agents, build data products with rigorous structure. They need the content that trains agents, the context that grounds them, and the consumption interfaces that make them useful to real people solving real problems.\n\nData products have evolved from abstract concept to essential infrastructure.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI and cost efficiency creating optimism – Swiss CEOs ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### Focus on AI\n\nAI is already delivering measurable added value for many Swiss companies. Around 80% of Swiss CEOs said that the AI initiatives they have run so far have exceeded their expectations. Almost all (94%) said that AI will be critical for their business model in the next two years.\n\n54% of Swiss respondents cited “autonomous AI agents”, which are designed to act independently in order to complete tasks with minimum effort, as the most important AI technology. In second place with 50% each were “machine learning” for data analysis and decision-making and “physical AI”. This represents the combination of machines and AI to improve manufacturing processes. [...] According to the CEOs surveyed, the greatest challenges posed by AI in Switzerland are rising cybersecurity risks (44%), high initial investment and uncertain returns (40%).\n\nWhen it comes to employment, a differentiated picture emerges: more than half of Swiss CEOs (54%) expect total employment to decline in 2026 as a result of AI investment. At the same time, at 46%, almost half agree with the statement that AI investment will help maintain existing recruitment levels or attract new talent with different qualification profiles.\n\n#### Increasing interest in acquisitions and sales [...] ### Request for proposal (RFP) - exclusively for Switzerland\n\nHow can we support you?\n\n#### Trending topics\n\nSee more\n\nSee more\n\n#### Spotlight\n\nAI insights\n\nCEO agenda\n\nCFO agenda\n\nEY Center for board matters\n\nIn-Person Events\n\nOperations leaders\n\nTechnology leaders\n\nExplore our insights\n\n### Services\n\nEY helps clients create long-term value for all stakeholders.

AI can reduce the time spent on interview scheduling, help to provide a consistent interview experience and shorten the overall time to hire.\n\nThe newest frontier in an AI-driven hiring process is AI interview agents. Employers are starting to experiment with AI interviewers that conduct phone interviews at times that work best for candidates.

The startup said it is targeting ARR of more than $100 million by April 2026.\n\nLike other vibe-coding platforms, Emergent uses AI agents to help users design, build, test, and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps.

The startup was previously valued at $100 million post-money, another source told TechCrunch.\n\nProsus, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Together, and Y Combinator also participated.

The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out for comment. [...] The company’s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### What’s Actually New\n\nWhat is newsworthy is the connection between e-commerce, customer service, and insights. Are the days of repeating ourselves ad nauseam as we move between multiple customer service channels and reps finally over? Connecting disparate data silos is the perpetual thorn in the side of organizations that try to deliver contextual experiences.\n\nThe new offering from Google, coupled with the Personal Intelligence feature (in beta), offers the promise of a single platform that has both the data and the customer-facing layer to deliver contextual interactions. CX leaders should help organizations avoid the trap of simply buying a box of CX, as creating effective, connected experiences requires a sound strategy just as much as the tech to deliver it. [...] Forrester Logo\n\n# Google Has Entered The Contact Center Chat\n\nColleen Fazio, Senior Analyst\n\nEmily Pfeiffer, Principal Analyst\n\nKate Leggett, Vice President, Principal Analyst\n\nAt the recent NRF event, the headline was shopping in answer engines, with Google’s new Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience and Universal Commerce Protocol getting lots of attention. Tucked below the fold, however, was important news for CX and contact center leaders: the announcement of Google Cloud’s Customer Experience Agent Studio. [...] Similarly on the commerce side, it would be easy to write this off as another “agentic commerce” offering. Announcements of exclusive partnerships between commerce or payments vendors and answer engines (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity) seem to come daily. It’s worth noting that although Google and others claim to have agentic solutions, “agentic commerce” is an often inaccurately used term. Most likely, “agentic” refers to the use of agents to execute direct requests from users/customers, such as finding products that match a query. These are assistive, conversational experiences and are less likely to act autonomously, which is the requirement for the “agentic” moniker.\n\n### What’s Actually New&quot;,

Researchers increasingly use AI at every stage of the research workflow — from generating ideas and drafting research questions to analyzing and summarizing data. Experience research vendors are embedding AI throughout their platforms and introducing AI-supported methods, such as AI-moderated interviews and synthetic audiences. Amid all this innovation, one thing hasn’t changed: Good research still depends on thoughtful planning and sound methodology. AI can accelerate work but it won’t fix foundational research planning such as: [...] Understanding customers is the foundation for creating successful products and services and improving customer experience.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Four priorities for AI-powered identity and network access ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Just as unsanctioned software as a service (SaaS) apps once created shadow IT and data leakage risks, organizations now face agent sprawl—an exploding number of AI systems that can access data, call external services, and act autonomously. While you want your employees to get the most out of these powerful and convenient productivity tools, you also want to protect them from new risks.\n\nFortunately, the same Zero Trust principles that apply to human employees apply to AI agents, and now you can use the same tools to manage both. You can also add more advanced controls: monitoring agent interaction with external services, enforcing guardrails around internet access, and preventing sensitive data from flowing into unauthorized AI or SaaS applications. [...] That’s where generative AI and agentic AI come in. Instead of reacting to incidents after the fact, AI agents help your identity teams proactively design, refine, and govern access. Which policies should you create? How do you keep them current? Agents work alongside you to identify policy gaps, recommend smarter and more consistent controls, and continuously improve coverage without adding friction for your users. You can interact with these agents the same way you’d talk to a colleague. They can help you analyze sign-in patterns, existing policies, and identity posture to understand what policies you need, why they matter, and how to improve them. [...] The real advantage of AI-powered protection is speed, scale, and adaptability. Static, human-only workflows just can’t keep up with constantly evolving cyberattacks. Working side-by-side with AI agents, your teams can continuously assess posture, strengthen access controls, and respond to emerging risks before they turn into compromise.\n\n## 2. Manage, govern, and protect AI and agents\n\nAnother critical shift is to make every AI agent a first-class identity and govern it with the same rigor as human identities. This means inventorying agents, assigning clear ownership, governing what they can access, and applying consistent security standards across all identities.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;29th CEO Survey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The talent challenge reflects broader patterns in how organisations are approaching AI adoption. Many are applying tried and tested methods for attracting and retaining technical talent—focusing on traditional IT roles and governance frameworks—when transformation requires different thinking. The market demands bold moves, and Australia’s businesses have an opportunity to accelerate capacity building, particularly around internal talent development, to close the gap between ambition and execution.\n\n### AI infrastructure exists; investment timelines need acceleration [...] ##### AI practices\n\nWhat we see is that CEOs in companies with stronger AI foundations are reporting better outcomes; 2.6 times revenue increases and 2.5 times cost decreases than those who haven’t established that fundamental basis. When a range of foundations for AI adoption are in place, genuine opportunity is created.\n\nThe challenge is matching investment timelines with transformation requirements and Australia’s CEOs recognise this gap. Creating operating environments where AI agents are fully integrated with human workflows takes 18–24-month commitments. Australia also faces infrastructure considerations; new AI capabilities announced in the US can take 12-18 months to become fully available in Australia-based secure infrastructure due to cloud residency requirements. [...] With CEOs listing their number one concern as transforming their business fast enough to keep up with the scope and pace of technological change, investment in emerging technology including AI is a high priority, and they’re aware their capabilities need strengthening. Only 28% believe their current investment levels are enough to deliver on their AI goals (compared with 40% globally), and only 28% can attract high-quality technical AI talent (42% globally).&quot;,

[...] ## Shrinking headcount\n\nAt the end of Q3 FY26, TCS reported a global headcount of 582,163, down by over 11,000 employees sequentially and sharply lower than its Q1 level of 613,069. Tech Mahindra also reported a decline, with headcount falling to 149,616 in Q3 from 152,714 in the previous quarter. HCLTech reported a marginal sequential dip of 0.1% to 226,379 employees.\n\nInfosys appeared as an outlier, increasing headcount to 337,034 in Q3 from 331,991 in the previous quarter, adding nearly 5,000 software professionals. This, however, was still far lower than the employee growth the company registered in the previous quarter, indicating a struggle to attract the relevant talent akin to its peers.\n\n## AI is reducing the need for large teams&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;particularly with the EU AI Act on the horizon. Correlating AI interactions and DLP alerts in Microsoft Sentinel using Purview Audit (specifically the CopilotInteraction logs) data allows for real-time responses. Automated SOAR playbooks can then trigger protective actions - such as revoking an Agent ID - if an entity attempts to access sensitive HR or financial data. Final Thoughts Securing AI at scale is an architectural shift. By layering Identity, Session Governance, and Agentic Identity, AI moves from being a fragmented risk to a governed tool that actually works for the modern workplace. [...] “Anyone in organization” sharing option. Restricting agent creation and sharing to a validated security group is essential to prevent unvetted agent sprawl and ensure that only compliant agents are discoverable. 6. The Human Layer: “Safe Harbors” over Bans Security fails when it creates more friction than the risk it seeks to mitigate. Instead of an outright ban, investment in AI skilling-teaching users context minimization (redacting specifics before interacting with a model) - is the better path. Providing a sanctioned, enterprise-grade \&quot;Safe Harbor\&quot; like M365 Copilot offers a superior tool that naturally cuts down the use of Shadow AI. 7. Continuous Ops: Monitoring &amp; Regulatory Audit Security is not a “set and forget” project, particularly with the EU AI Act on the horizon. Correlating [...] Protection with IRM rounds this out by enforcing encryption and usage rights on the files themselves. When a user tries to print a \&quot;Do Not Print\&quot; document, Purview triggers an alert that flows into Microsoft Sentinel. This gives the SOC visibility into actual policy violations instead of them having to hunt through generic activity logs. 5. The “Agentic” Era: Agent 365 &amp; Sharing Controls Now that we&#x27;re moving from \&quot;Chat\&quot; to \&quot;Agents\&quot;, Agent 365 and Entra Agent ID provide the necessary identity and control plane for autonomous entities. A quick tip: in large-scale tenants, default settings often present a governance risk. A critical first step is navigating to the Microsoft 365 admin center (Copilot &gt; Agents) to disable the default “Anyone in organization” sharing option. Restricting agent&quot;,

HR’s purpose—to support, develop, and align the workforce and its skills with the company’s mission—spans the human and digital workforces.

Companies succeeding with AI are building an AI-ready culture by listening to employees and involving them from the beginning. In these organizations, any AI implementation is done with them, not to them. By engaging teams to understand their daily challenges and needs, organizations are more likely to implement AI tools that are more relevant and that enhance employee experience.&quot;,

[...] capable of regular and rapid change. However, it is common for the workforce to fear new technology and what it may do to their roles and futures, which can stifle agility. Dean Bortz, Director of AI Go-To-Market, Google, says: “You’re going to get a portion of the enterprise that just starts adopting it naturally because they’re curious and they want to. But 90 percent of your organization is going to need some sort of enablement and training to understand how the tools work.” Therefore, leadership needs to frame technology as an enabler, and give employees the agency to validate the opportunities for themselves. One effective approach is to establish small, cross-functional teams with the autonomy to innovate and drive change. Another is to focus on centers of excellence, where diverse [...] human staff by 2027. This signals a future where small, durable human cores orchestrate large AI-augmented ecosystems. In this environment, tech leaders can take on board the following five tips: The adoption curve will be uneven. Some organizations may chase hype and overbuild. Others may miss compounding returns by waiting for ‘perfect’ tech. The path that wins is practical: many small bets, ruthless measurement, and fast scaling of what works. Translate unmetered intelligence into customer trust, resilient operations, and new revenue. Tech will compound faster than organizations can rewrite job descriptions. Train for orchestration, prompt, and policy design, judgment and taste. The product in many categories becomes the ‘bedside manner’, with the emphasis on trust, clarity and empathy&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and Connectivity Unlock New Revenue for OEMs&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This matters because it allows automakers to deploy connected features without building the entire technology stack themselves. The hardware collects the data. The hardware gathers the data, the cloud brings it together and stores it, and AI tools analyse it to determine what happens next. Whether that’s notifying a driver about low tyre pressure or recommending a feature trial based on how they actually drive.\n\nWhere Agentic AI fits in connected vehicles [...] Where Agentic AI fits in connected vehicles\n\nFor OEMs, this means knowing how customers use their vehicles, and using that to personalise services and anticipate what they’ll need next. In India, TVS Motor is using Salesforce to unify data from its dealerships, service centres, and vehicles into a 360-degree customer view. This lets them track a buyer’s journey beyond the purchase.\n\n## TVS Motors uses integrated customer data to build a connected customer journey.\n\nThis intelligence is also speeding up how vehicles improve. Traditionally, meaningful design changes took years of R&amp;D and only reached customers with a new model launch. Today, engineering teams have access to real-world data from millions of drivers operating in real-world conditions. [...] # The Post-Sale Playbook: How AI and Connectivity Unlock New Revenue for OEMs\n\nConnected vehicle experience with agentic AI\n\n## See how Indian automakers are moving from selling products to delivering continuous experiences — and capturing new value along the way\n\n### Gourav Ray\n\n## Share article\n\nFor years, OEMs made most of their money when the vehicle was sold, with service and parts bringing in some steady — but fairly modest — revenue afterwards. Now that vehicles are connected, that model is changing. Software subscriptions and data-driven services are creating entirely new ways to generate value over the full life of the vehicle.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI deployment accelerates despite risks: KPMG | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and Workday are among tech giants that began launching agents last year, promising the next stage of enterprise automation.\n\nBig Four accounting firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have quickly jumped on the band wagon as well, offering their own agentic AI solutions for customers.\n\nAmong the enterprises now using agentic AI, many are taking a balanced, strategic approach, according to the results of the KPMG survey.\n\nNearly half of leaders (46%) said they were focused on efficiency and revenue growth as it relates to their AI agent strategies, according to KPMG’s report. Meanwhile, leader concerns about data privacy, regulatory issues and data quality are at their highest in three quarters, the report said. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nThe still nascent technology continues to pose implementation challenges, KPMG said. The primary obstacles to agent deployment include technical skills gaps, workforce resistance to change and system complexity, according to a report on the findings.\n\nGartner predicts that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls. [...] “Most agentic AI projects right now are early stage experiments or proof of concepts that are mostly driven by hype and are often misapplied,” Anushree Verma, a senior director analyst at Gartner, said in a Wednesday press release. “This can blind organizations to the real cost and complexity of deploying AI agents at scale, stalling projects from moving into production. They need to cut through the hype to make careful, strategic decisions about where and how they apply this emerging technology.”\n\nMany vendors are contributing to the hype by engaging in “agent washing” — the rebranding of existing products, such as AI assistants, robotic process automation and chatbots, “without substantial agentic capabilities,” according to the release.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The HR transformation has been a long time in the making. In recent years, it has been accelerated by workforce trends (e.g. telecommuting and mobile workforces) and generational challenges. It has also incorporated the rapid advancement of automation, cognitive processing and artificial intelligence (AI). The impact of increasing regulatory burdens along with their security, fraud, and risk implications has also been felt. At the same time, HR is being challenged to attract more informed and sophisticated talent who are, in turn, assessing employers on their social, economic, and corporate values. [...] When the good go bad © 2016 KPMG LLP , a Canadian limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. All rights reserved.\n12 The Evolution of HR Welcome to the era of “Digital Labour” , where automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are redefining – and in many cases, replacing – jobs across all industries. Although filled with promise, this technological revolution presents many challenges for HR departments, not the least of which is the need to modify workforce strategies, adopt new systems and processes, refresh recruitment and branding strategies, and manage the potential displacement of labour – all while keeping employee and client privacy in mind. [...] Managing digital labour means taking automation to its next natural step and understanding what that means for the company and staff, including for talent strategies, labour relations, and the leadership who will need to lead and manage these new efficiencies with likely less staff. It’s about HR leading the business through this transition, and that’s going to be exciting and challenging.\nManaging digital labour The advance of machine learning means HR professionals must not only manage current implications, but know where the technology is taking the company.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MIT&#x27;s new &#x27;recursive&#x27; framework lets LLMs process 10 ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## RLMs in action\n\nTo validate the framework, the researchers tested RLMs against base models and other agentic approaches like CodeAct and summary agents across a variety of long-context tasks, including retrieval and multi-hop question answering.\n\nThe results demonstrated strong performance gains at the 10 million+ token scale. On BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark involving inputs of 6 to 11 million tokens, standard base models failed completely, scoring 0%. In contrast, the RLM powered by GPT-5 achieved a score of 91.33%, significantly outperforming the Summary Agent (70.47%) and CodeAct (51%). [...] RLMs apply this logic to generative AI. Instead of feeding a long prompt directly into the neural network, the framework loads the text as a string variable inside a Python coding environment. The LLM is given general context about the data (such as the total character count) but does not \&quot;see\&quot; the text initially.\n\nOnce the prompt is stored as a variable, the LLM acts as a programmer. It writes Python code to interact with the external variable, using standard commands to peek into the data. For example, the model might use regular expressions to search for specific keywords like \&quot;Chapter 1\&quot; or \&quot;financial results.\&quot;\n\nWhen the code execution finds a relevant snippet, the RLM pulls only that specific chunk into its active context window for analysis. [...] Because the prompt resides in the environment&#x27;s memory rather than the model&#x27;s context window, the system can handle inputs far larger than the model&#x27;s training limit. Importantly, to the end-user, the RLM behaves exactly like a standard model: It accepts a string and returns an answer. This allows enterprise teams to swap standard API calls for RLMs.\n\nFor developers looking to experiment, the RLM code is currently available on GitHub.\n\n\&quot;A key argument for RLMs is that most complex tasks can be decomposed into smaller, &#x27;local&#x27; sub-tasks,\&quot; Zhang said. \&quot;However, how to perform this context/problem decomposition is non-trivial, and the model must be capable of performing this.\&quot;\n\n## RLMs in action&quot;,

However, 64% reallocated less than 20% of financial resources, and 70% reallocated less than 20% of human resources.\n One of the ways to reinvent is to look beyond company’s walls and across industry boundaries, to create value. However, 72% have not undertaken a major acquisition (over 10% of assets) in the last three years.\n\n## Two defining issues - AI and Climate\n\n#### Generative AI (GenAI) enthusiasm remains undimmed, but lingering trust issues are holding back its full potential [...] 82% of Asia Pacific CEOs have adopted GenAI in the last 5 years.\n In 2024, 37% of Asia Pacific CEOs report increased revenue, 40% note higher profitability, and 58% observe improved employee efficiency due to GenAI adoption.\n\n Only 34% of Asia Pacific CEOs express high trust in embedding AI into their core processes - a reflection of ongoing challenges in adoption.\n Many CEOs are choosing to integrate AI more into technology platforms (43%) and business processes (37%) rather than workforce and skills (29%).\n\n#### Climate investments are paying off\n\n 87% of Asia Pacific CEOs have initiated climate-friendly investments in the last five years.\n\n 63% of Asia Pacific CEOs have tied their personal incentive compensation to sustainability metrics, surpassing the global average of 56%.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Artificial intelligence, human impact\n\nAt some point in the future, humans will have more daily interactions with bots than they do with each other.

Chawla\n\n##### Jan 20, 2026 [...] The CRI report explores how, in the years ahead, various types of AI (e.g., machine learning, agentic AI) will transform every element of the R&amp;D value chain: discovery, preclinical testing, clinical trials, clinical manufacturing, and regulatory approvals.\n\nResearch revealed that the most widely adopted AI use case in the drug discovery phase was target identification: finding the specific molecule involved in the development of a disease (such as a protein or gene) that a new drug will act upon.\n\nForty-three percent of organizations are already implementing AI in this way. Of these, 32 percent said that the process is more efficient and takes less time, reporting an average time savings of 28 percent compared to before adopting the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI boom, hiring bust: Indian IT firms add just 17 net ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Shrinking headcount\n\nAt the end of Q3 FY26, TCS reported a global headcount of 582,163, down by over 11,000 employees sequentially and sharply lower than its Q1 level of 613,069. Tech Mahindra also reported a decline, with headcount falling to 149,616 in Q3 from 152,714 in the previous quarter. HCLTech reported a marginal sequential dip of 0.1% to 226,379 employees.\n\nInfosys appeared as an outlier, increasing headcount to 337,034 in Q3 from 331,991 in the previous quarter, adding nearly 5,000 software professionals. This, however, was still far lower than the employee growth the company registered in the previous quarter, indicating a struggle to attract the relevant talent akin to its peers.\n\n## AI is reducing the need for large teams [...] ## Hiring gives way to reskilling, subcontracting\n\nEarnings calls from top IT companies for the October–December quarter show that while clients are increasing AI adoption, IT services firms are no longer responding with large-scale hiring.\n\nTCS said it continues to hire from campuses and laterally for roles aligned with future requirements. However, wherever the company was not finding success in re-deployment, it released the workforce. In Q3 alone, TCS fired approximately 1,800 people, the company acknowledged during the earnings call.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of talent availability, IT services firms are investing heavily in reskilling. [...] The era of large-scale hiring at Indian IT services firms is giving way to a more measured approach, as companies reduce staff through automating routine work while still struggling to hire AI specialists, despite a surge in client demand for AI.\n\n“Top five Indian IT firms added only 17 net employees in the first nine months of FY26 versus 17,764 in the same period last year,” said Chirag Mehta, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research. “That is what AI-era productivity looks like in practice: more output per employee, fewer benches, and tighter utilization.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Share TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas: Enabling Transformation and Efficiency. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas: Enabling Transformation and Efficiency. TCS’ agentic AI platform helps manufacturing firms scale, govern, and optimize intelligent agents, creating a unified operational backbone for transformation. * Scale agentic AI across diverse platforms with a unified backbone for governance, orchestration, and enterprise knowledge. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas unifies and scales AI agents across enterprise systems—embedding governance, observability, and resilience to accelerate transformation. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas is an agentic AI platform designed to help organizations move beyond isolated AI pilots and scale agent-driven operations across the enterprise. Unlike traditional platforms that focus primarily on agent development, Manufacturing AI Canvas emphasizes how agents operate in production. For manufacturing enterprises, these super agents provide a head start by encapsulating proven patterns for supply chain orchestration, procurement optimization, maintenance planning, and operational decision-making—helping organizations transition quickly from experimentation to production-scale use cases. In manufacturing and industrial settings—where reliability is paramount and processes span multiple systems—the absence of a unified platform increases risk, slows adoption, and fuels skepticism about the scalability of agentic AI. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas provides a unified operational backbone for agentic AI, enabling enterprises to scale, govern, and optimize intelligent agents across diverse platforms and critical business systems. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas enables enterprises to manage agentic AI at scale through a centralized execution and operations layer. Teams retain the flexibility to use their preferred development platforms, while all agent actions are coordinated through a unified system that standardizes workflows, maintains shared enterprise knowledge, and enforces consistent controls. For manufacturing organizations, pre-built Super Agents accelerate adoption by delivering proven solutions for supply chain orchestration, procurement optimization, maintenance planning, and operational decision-making. Manufacturing AI Canvas enforces enterprise policy and operational discipline at the point where agents interact with real systems and data, ensuring consistent controls regardless of the underlying platform—whether Foundry, Copilot, ServiceNow, Agentforce, UiPath, Camunda, or custom runtimes. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas provides enterprises with a streamlined approach to scaling agentic AI responsibly. **TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas** enables outcomes-focused automation across supply chain, procurement, maintenance, and operations—backed by the discipline required for mission-critical enterprise environments.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI boom, hiring bust: Indian IT firms add just 17 net ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Shrinking headcount\n\nAt the end of Q3 FY26, TCS reported a global headcount of 582,163, down by over 11,000 employees sequentially and sharply lower than its Q1 level of 613,069. Tech Mahindra also reported a decline, with headcount falling to 149,616 in Q3 from 152,714 in the previous quarter. HCLTech reported a marginal sequential dip of 0.1% to 226,379 employees.\n\nInfosys appeared as an outlier, increasing headcount to 337,034 in Q3 from 331,991 in the previous quarter, adding nearly 5,000 software professionals. This, however, was still far lower than the employee growth the company registered in the previous quarter, indicating a struggle to attract the relevant talent akin to its peers.\n\n## AI is reducing the need for large teams [...] ## Hiring gives way to reskilling, subcontracting\n\nEarnings calls from top IT companies for the October–December quarter show that while clients are increasing AI adoption, IT services firms are no longer responding with large-scale hiring.\n\nTCS said it continues to hire from campuses and laterally for roles aligned with future requirements. However, wherever the company was not finding success in re-deployment, it released the workforce. In Q3 alone, TCS fired approximately 1,800 people, the company acknowledged during the earnings call.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of talent availability, IT services firms are investing heavily in reskilling. [...] TCS now has more than 217,000 employees with advanced AI skills, a three-fold increase over last year. HLCTech is implementing GenAI and AI capabilities across its lines of business and scaling adoption with customer-specific AI tooling. To enable all this, over 38,000 additional employees have been trained on GenAI, and more than 600 on responsible AI, acknowledged C. Vijayakumar, CEO at HCLTech, during the earnings call.\n\nMehta noted there is also a knock-on effect where IT services companies are tilting toward subcontracting and gig-style capacity for variable demand, rather than keeping large permanent benches. That can reduce visible headcount growth even when delivery volume rises.\n\n## Related content\n\n### Gartner: Global AI spending to reach $2.5 trillion in 2026&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Great Talent Recalibration: How Macroeconomic Shifts ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organizations today are navigating the most turbulent macroeconomic environment in decades. For talent leaders—chief people officers (CPOs), chief human resources officers (CHROs), and heads of talent—the ground beneath long-held assumptions is shifting quickly. The impacts of post-globalization are evolving, capital is becoming more constrained, labor pools are shrinking, and artificial intelligence is transforming how work gets done.\n\nBain &amp; Company’s recent CPO Forum focused on the forces reshaping the global talent landscape. The message is both clear and urgent: The context in which most HR leaders built their careers is not the context in which they will lead the future. We are in an exceptionally tumultuous period, unlike anything experienced since the early 1970s.

For talent leaders, there are new constraints on the movement of people across borders—a foundational assumption of many multinational workforce strategies.\n\nOne example: In semiconductors, the US has set restrictions not only on where certain goods can be sold, but on which passport holders may work on specific technologies destined for certain markets. Visa rules, trade policies, and rapid geopolitical shifts—such as tariff changes or the redeployment of staff following geopolitical conflict—are complicating global workforce planning.&quot;,
