  <li><b>Cognizant Expands Strategic Partnership with Google Cloud to Operationalize Agentic AI at Scale (Published: 2026-02-16)</b><br/>
    <p>Cognizant’s latest announcement, detailed at <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-16-Cognizant-Expands-Strategic-Partnership-with-Google-Cloud-to-Operationalize-Agentic-AI-at-Enterprise-Scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognizant + Google Cloud news</a>, marks a major step in operationalizing agentic AI for enterprise use cases. By marrying Google Cloud’s advanced AI stack with Cognizant’s consulting and vertical expertise, the two aim to expedite the development and deployment of intelligent agents in key functions like HR, finance, and healthcare. This sets a higher competitive benchmark for SaaS-native AI capabilities and urges Workday practitioners and Deloitte teams to closely monitor hyperscaler integration strategies and support rapid adoption for shared clients.</p>

  <li><b>TechCrunch: The Enterprise AI Land Grab Accelerates as Glean Builds the 'Glue Layer' for Autonomous Agents (Published: 2026-02-15)</b><br/>
    <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch</a> reports a strategic evolution in enterprise AI platforms. Glean’s connective tissue approach to agent orchestration allows disparate SaaS apps and their agents to interoperate securely. Their emergence signals a new requirement for Workday, Oracle, and ServiceNow: ensure agentic features can ‘plug in’ to neutral, standards-based coordination frameworks. For Deloitte, this signals a client advisory pivot—highlighting futureproof architectures and reducing single-vendor exposure.</p>

  <li><b>SiliconANGLE: TheCUBE Research 2026 Predictions—Enterprise ROI Comes to the Forefront (Published: 2026-02-15)</b><br/>
    <p><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/15/thecube-research-2026-predictions-year-enterprise-roi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiliconANGLE’s</a> annual research states that buyers now prioritize clear, repeatable business value from agentic and generative AI. Solutions are increasingly measured based on their automation scope, integration into HR/finance workflows, and post-go-live productivity results. The “so what” for Workday and Deloitte: be prepared with proven ROI analytics, value stories, and metrics that resonate with CFOs and HR leadership.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cognizant + Google Cloud</b>: Their expanded partnership is designed to accelerate agentic AI at enterprise scale, blending Google’s robust AI tools with Cognizant’s industry acumen. This leapfrogs many standalone SaaS vendors and could disrupt procurement priorities for joint Workday clients, especially if native integrations follow quickly. For Deloitte, keeping pace with Google Cloud agent pipelines is a must.<br/></li>
  <li><b>Glean</b>: By launching a middleware layer for efficient, secure agent orchestration, Glean shapes the emerging competitive landscape—where the most flexible and interoperable platforms win. Deloitte’s Workday advisory must help clients assess not only vendor “agent IQ” but also their ecosystem openness and orchestration strategies.<br/></li>
  <li><b>TheCUBE/Industry Analyst Firms</b>: A sharper focus on enterprise ROI will create a new basis for SaaS and agentic AI selection. This puts pressure on Deloitte and Workday engagements to deliver impact data and post-implementation analytics, not just technical configuration.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Hyperscaler AI Agent Orchestration</b> (<a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-16-Cognizant-Expands-Strategic-Partnership-with-Google-Cloud-to-Operationalize-Agentic-AI-at-Enterprise-Scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognizant + Google Cloud</a>): Upskill on Google Cloud Vertex AI and orchestrated agent solutions for rapid client implementations.</li>
  <li><b>Agentic AI Ecosystem Mapping</b> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch/Glean</a>): Develop fluency in emerging agentic middleware, helping clients futureproof HR tech choices.</li>
  <li><b>Value Realization & ROI Attribution</b> (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/15/thecube-research-2026-predictions-year-enterprise-roi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiliconANGLE</a>): Build robust value cases and establish KPI tracking from day one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refresh integration playbooks with the latest Google Cloud agentic AI tooling.</li>
  <li>Host cross-disciplinary briefings on agentic AI orchestration platforms and implications for Workday environments.</li>
  <li>Create fresh ROI showcases on agentic AI automations within HR operations for client-facing engagements.</li>
  <li>Audit Deloitte's Workday advisory and implementation templates for open standards and extensibility recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Risk:</b> A fragmented agentic AI landscape could drive vendor lock-in and data integration complexity.<br/>
      <b>Mitigation:</b> Embed open interface and agent orchestration requirements into all new client projects; escalate vendor-agnostic approaches in all alliances and advisory support.</li>
  <li><b>Risk:</b> Lack of ROI measurement in pilot phases could erode trust in agentic AI and stall broader adoption.<br/>
      <b>Mitigation:</b> Make clinched benefit tracking part of every engagement’s inception, with iterative reporting and roadmaps linked to measured outcomes.</li>
</ul>

Strategic partnerships and technical progress in this space demand immediate vigilance from Workday clients, product owners, and Deloitte advisory teams.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant Expands Strategic Partnership with Google Cloud to Operationalize Agentic AI at Scale (Published: 2026-02-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant&#x27;s latest partnership with Google Cloud signifies a robust move to bring agentic AI into enterprise operations, with a spotlight on AI-enabled automation and operational intelligence. The announcement details how Cognizant aims to combine Google Cloud’s advanced AI infrastructure with its own industry consulting capabilities to roll out new agent-based solutions in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and HR (see: https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-16-Cognizant-Expands-Strategic-Partnership-with-Google-Cloud-to-Operationalize-Agentic-AI-at-Enterprise-Scale).\\n\\nStrategically, this partnership intensifies the competition in core Workday markets, leveraging hyperscaler-native AI orchestration to challenge SaaS players&#x27; value propositions. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this signals the importance of both technical fluency with hyperscaler agent tooling (especially Google’s Vertex AI and autoML agent frameworks) and expanded advisory on integration best practices. Workday clients must remain agile in evaluating their current AI implementation models vs. hybrid or partner-augmented strategies, as the pace of innovation has quickened.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-16-Cognizant-Expands-Strategic-Partnership-with-Google-Cloud-to-Operationalize-Agentic-AI-at-Enterprise-Scale\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;TechCrunch: The Enterprise AI Land Grab Accelerates as Glean Builds the &#x27;Glue Layer&#x27; for Autonomous Agents (Published: 2026-02-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;TechCrunch&#x27;s coverage highlights a significant shift in the SaaS and enterprise productivity stack, with vendors like Glean building connective infrastructure that enables various autonomous AI agents to work cooperatively (https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface). The story points out the growing demand for robust agent orchestration and integration capabilities—beyond mere LLM chatbots—across leading enterprise platforms. This trend is rapidly influencing procurement strategies and API-level requirements in the selection of future HR and business systems.\\n\\nFor Workday’s ecosystem, the existence of a flourishing &#x27;agent coordination&#x27; layer outside of core HCM or Finance applications creates both risk and opportunity. Vendors banking on proprietary AI or single-stack agentic features may quickly fall behind if open orchestration models gain traction. Deloitte&#x27;s advisory teams need to keep clients apprised of architectural decisions that promote maximum interoperability and futureproofing.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SiliconANGLE: TheCUBE Research 2026 Predictions—Enterprise ROI Comes to the Forefront (Published: 2026-02-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SiliconANGLE&#x27;s annual research outlook emphasizes that 2026 will be a year defined by demonstrable enterprise ROI from AI investments, particularly in agentic automation, data unification, and workflow augmentation (https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/15/thecube-research-2026-predictions-year-enterprise-roi). The coverage stresses that buyers are moving past pilot phase and now demand clear, repeatable business value from AI-driven transformation projects. Solutions will be measured on their ability to reduce manual processes across HR, payroll, and finance, and on their compatibility with broader automation ecosystems.\\n\\nFor Workday clients and Deloitte’s delivery teams, this trend underlines the urgent need to move from sandbox and experimentation to scalable, outcome-oriented deployments. Robust ROI attribution and value realization frameworks should be front and center in all proposals, roadmaps, and migration stories. Competitive positioning will depend increasingly on evidence—not vision or narrative—of agentic AI’s impact on cost and productivity.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/15/thecube-research-2026-predictions-year-enterprise-roi\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant + Google Cloud\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant and Google Cloud announced a broad initiative to operationalize agentic AI in multi-vertical enterprise settings, using Google’s infrastructure for rapid solution development.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This move will accelerate time-to-market for agentic AI use cases that may compete directly with Workday’s roadmap, especially in HCM and business process automation.

By marrying Google Cloud’s advanced AI stack with Cognizant’s consulting and vertical expertise, the two aim to expedite the development and deployment of intelligent agents in key functions like HR, finance, and healthcare. This sets a higher competitive benchmark for SaaS-native AI capabilities and urges Workday practitioners and Deloitte teams to closely monitor hyperscaler integration strategies and support rapid adoption for shared clients.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;TechCrunch: The Enterprise AI Land Grab Accelerates as Glean Builds the &#x27;Glue Layer&#x27; for Autonomous Agents (Published: 2026-02-15)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/the-enterprise-ai-land-grab-is-on-glean-is-building-the-layer-beneath-the-interface\\\&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; reports a strategic evolution in enterprise AI platforms. Glean’s connective tissue approach to agent orchestration allows disparate SaaS apps and their agents to interoperate securely. Their emergence signals a new requirement for Workday, Oracle, and ServiceNow: ensure agentic features can ‘plug in’ to neutral, standards-based coordination frameworks. For Deloitte, this signals a client advisory pivot—highlighting futureproof architectures and reducing single-vendor exposure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SiliconANGLE: TheCUBE Research 2026 Predictions—Enterprise ROI Comes to the Forefront (Published: 2026-02-15)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/15/thecube-research-2026-predictions-year-enterprise-roi\\\&quot;&gt;SiliconANGLE’s&lt;/a&gt; annual research states that buyers now prioritize clear, repeatable business value from agentic and generative AI. Solutions are increasingly measured based on their automation scope, integration into HR/finance workflows, and post-go-live productivity results. The “so what” for Workday and Deloitte: be prepared with proven ROI analytics, value stories, and metrics that resonate with CFOs and HR leadership.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cognizant + Google Cloud&lt;/b&gt;: Their expanded partnership is designed to accelerate agentic AI at enterprise scale, blending Google’s robust AI tools with Cognizant’s industry acumen. This leapfrogs many standalone SaaS vendors and could disrupt procurement priorities for joint Workday clients, especially if native integrations follow quickly. For Deloitte, keeping pace with Google Cloud agent pipelines is a must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glean&lt;/b&gt;: By launching a middleware layer for efficient, secure agent orchestration, Glean shapes the emerging competitive landscape—where the most flexible and interoperable platforms win.

[...] to act with greater confidence and agility. As a result, organizations can reduce friction, make faster decisions, and increase speed to market. Next, agentic AI begins to take over entire workflows, acting autonomously with minimal human oversight. And with full AI transformation, the risk function itself is reimagined — traditional methods are replaced with AI-native strategies that are faster, more precise, and deeply data-driven. [...] The organizations pulling ahead are those that treat AI not as a bolt-on, but as a strategic capability. They’re redesigning their operating models around the analytical risk management moments that matter and using AI automation — with a human-in-the-loop, by design — to speed up and strengthen data analysis and reallocate human capital to higher-value work. They’re not just using AI — they’re using it well. Importantly, AI is also leveling the playing field: It offers a powerful opportunity for smaller organizations to compete with larger ones by democratizing access to advanced analytics and decision-making tools that were once the domain of only the biggest players.&quot;,

Mastra’s open-source observational memory shows how stable context can outperform RAG while cutting token costs.\n\nSean Michael Kerner\n\n## Nvidia releases DreamDojo, a robot ‘world model’ trained on 44,000 hours of human video\n\nNvidia-led researchers unveiled DreamDojo, a robot “world model” trained on 44,000 hours of human egocentric video to help humanoid robots learn physical interaction faster, cheaper, and with more realistic real-time planning.\n\nMichael Nuñez\n\nPartner Content\n\n## AI&#x27;s GPU problem is actually a data delivery problem\n\nPresented by F5\n\nVB Staff\n\n## Security\n\nView all\n\n## How to test OpenClaw without giving an autonomous agent shell access to your corporate laptop [...] -\n\n### VB Transform 2026\n\nSan Francisco\n\nView event\n\nTue, Jul 14, 2026 - Wed, Jul 15, 2026\n\nSan Francisco\n\n### VB Transform 2026\n\nView event\n\n## Data\n\nView all\n\n## OpenAI deploys Cerebras chips for &#x27;near-instant&#x27; code generation in first major move beyond Nvidia\n\nThe partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;ByteDance on Saturday released Doubao 2.0, an upgrade to its chatbot app that currently commands the largest user base in China, approaching 200 million. The announcement, like Alibaba&#x27;s, also positioned the new model as suited to the AI agent era.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe rollout of Qwen3.5 could help further recent gains Alibaba has made in the cutthroat competition of AI models in China. Earlier this month, the e-commerce giant&#x27;s coupon giveaway campaign that encouraged consumers to purchase food and drink directly in the Qwen chatbot led to a seven-fold increase in active users, despite some glitches. [...] Alibaba unveils new Qwen3.5 model for &#x27;agentic AI era&#x27; | Reuters\n\nSkip to main content\n\nReport AdImage 1\n\nExclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionals Learn more about Refinitiv\n\n - Alibaba on Monday unveiled a new artificial intelligence model Qwen 3.5 designed to execute complex tasks independently, with big improvements in performance and cost that the Chinese tech giant claims beat major U.S. rival models on several benchmarks.\n\nThe release comes as Alibaba looks to attract more users to its Qwen chatbot app in China, a landscape currently dominated by rival tech giant ByteDance&#x27;s Doubao and DeepSeek, which became the first Chinese AI firm to break through globally last year. [...] Last year, the e-commerce giant was one of the first of DeepSeek&#x27;s competitors to respond to the startup&#x27;s viral rise, releasing Qwen 2.5-Max, which it claimed was superior to one of DeepSeek&#x27;s hit models.\n\nThe company did not mention DeepSeek in its announcement for Qwen3.5, and the several benchmarks it published only show the new model outperforming a previous iteration and rival U.S. models GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nDeepSeek is expected to release its new-generation model in the coming days, fueling anticipation among investors and industry insiders given the global tech share selloff the company triggered a year ago.\n\nReporting by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Sam Holmes\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Royal Greenland CIO: “We Want to Consume Standardized AI, Not ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Technology first, innovation next\n\nGo‑live is planned for March 1, 2027. The year 2026 is dedicated to the platform lift itself. From 2027, Royal Greenland will begin building business‑driven improvements on top of the standardized core—for example, new user interfaces and process optimization using small AI agents within finance and administration.\n\n“Royal Greenland and SAP have worked together since 1998, and we look forward to getting started on the technical part of the platform uplift this January,” Hassinggaard shared. “We’re keeping the transformation as simple as possible for now and will use 2027 to activate the benefits, such as improved data analysis, better user experience, and more efficient work processes.” [...] “We are a company that prefers to tap into existing AI solutions rather than invent them ourselves,” Hassinggaard said. “It’s far more efficient for us. There is no reason for us to spend resources reinventing what SAP already provides. The initial focus will be on process optimization within administrative functions such as finance—small AI agents that can streamline daily work.”\n\n## Advice to others: Allocate more time, and understand your method\n\nHassinggaard is clear that the RISE with SAP contract, methodology, and preparation work require time and organizational maturity. His advice to other companies facing a similar cloud ERP decision: “Do it thoroughly—and allocate more time than you think. Study the methodology, pricing, and contracts. And bring a competent advisor on board.” [...] Ellen Vig Nelausen is an integrated communications expert for SAP Regional Communications.\n\n### Read more\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup Takes Next Step in Digital Transformation with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition\n\n## The Ocean Cleanup Takes Next Step in Digital Transformation with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition\n\nSAP and Syngenta Announce Partnership to Scale AI-Assisted Agriculture\n\n## SAP and Syngenta Announce Partnership to Scale AI-Assisted Agriculture\n\nIntelligent Applications: The Next Step in Data-Driven Decision-Making\n\n## Intelligent Applications: The Next Step in Data-Driven Decision-Making\n\nSAP\n\nUnited States  \n+1-800-872-1727\n\nOr see our complete list of local country numbers\n\nContact us\n\nLinkedIn\nX\nEmail share&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Nvidia, Groq and the limestone race to real-time AI - VentureBeat&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### ​The engine for the next wave of growth\n\n​For the C-Suite, this potential convergence solves the \&quot;thinking time\&quot; latency crisis. Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Do you remember where you recently saw this technique mentioned? Nvidia’s Rubin press release: The technology includes “...the latest generations of Nvidia NVLink interconnect technology... to accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale MoE model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token.”\n\n​Jensen knows that achieving that coveted exponential growth in compute doesn’t come from pure brute force anymore. Sometimes you need to shift the architecture entirely to place the next stepping stone.\n\n### ​The latency crisis: Where Groq fits in\n\n​This long introduction brings us to Groq. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workday acquires Sana Labs for $1.1B to upgrade agentic AI work experiences - SiliconANGLE&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;UPDATED 12:00 EST / SEPTEMBER 16 2025\n\n### Workday acquires Sana Labs for $1.1B to upgrade agentic AI work experiences\n\nby  Kyt Dotson\n\nHuman resources and finance software giant Workday Inc. today announced the acquisition of Sana Labs AB, an artificial intelligence company offering enterprise knowledge and employee training tools, for about $1.1 billion.\n\nWorkday also announced new AI agents for HR, finance and industry use cases in its Illuminate platform alongside a new developer platform, including a low-code agent builder that will allow customers to deploy custom AI agents. [...] ### Workday upgrades its AI agents and work tools\n\nIn addition to today’s acquisition news, Workday also announced new AI agents, including a Financial Close Agent and Case Agent, purpose-built for complex business processes like performance reviews, planning and assisting with financial use cases.\n\nThe new agents are part of Workday Illuminate, Workday’s AI platform. The company said the new agents are “purpose-built for work,” embedded with their respective industry use cases and powered by deep insights into business data and context. [...] For use cases not covered by these agents and Workday’s already existing AI agents, the company today announced Workday Build, a new developer platform that gives customers and partners the power to create and deploy their own AI-powered solutions. It includes Flowise Agent Builder, a low-code tool that makes building agents on the company’s platform simple for both non-technical and advanced users.\n\n“The era of one-size-fits-all enterprise software is over,” said Peter Bailis, chief technology officer at Workday. “With Workday Build, customers go from consuming AI to creating with it, giving them the power to build intelligent solutions directly on their most trusted people and financial data.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Workday is also advancing agentic AI capabilities tailored to healthcare operations through its Agent System of Record. In settings where staffing, scheduling, and financial planning are tightly connected, the Agent System of Record enables agents to act on real-time data from across HR and finance systems, supporting key decisions like adjusting shift coverage based on patient volume, labor costs, or credentialing requirements.\n\nCredentialing is another space where agents are showing value. Instead of relying on spreadsheet tracking and periodic audits, health systems are deploying agents to monitor license renewals, training completions, and policy compliance in real time—reducing risk and administrative burden. [...] ## What’s Next: Putting Agentic AI into Action\n\nAgentic AI is becoming embedded into the operational and clinical systems that healthcare teams use every day. Across key healthcare AI applications like scheduling, documentation, credentialing, treatment planning, and research workflows, early deployments are showing where agentic AI can reduce friction and support faster and more informed decisions that drive outcomes.\n\nBut deployment is only part of the challenge. Real impact depends on how well AI-powered systems are governed, how clearly their purpose is defined, and how effectively they’re integrated into the environments they’re meant to support. That includes aligning with the realities of care delivery, data infrastructure, and oversight requirements. [...] In healthcare, even more so than other industries, agentic AI has an important dual impact: it helps to both optimize healthcare operations and efficiencies while powering scalable high-quality care provision. In clinical settings, agents help maintain continuity by adapting to real-time patient conditions, minimizing gaps in care, and aligning actions to treatment goals. On the operational side, they support dynamic resource allocation, reduce bottlenecks, and bring coordination into daily decision-making.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI Agents for HR: Top Use Cases and Examples | Workday SG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI for HR fills the gap. It can interpret nuance, make decisions dynamically, and take initiative across multi-step processes, offloading the complexity that BPA wasn’t built to handle. For example: Agents can identify when a benefits request doesn’t follow the usual path or when a policy requires clarification and either make the adjustment itself or flag the issue to a human to handle it.\n\nSome of the areas where HR agents are already providing essential support:\n\n Screening job applicants and scheduling interviews\n Handling PTO, benefits, and policy-related requests\n Delivering onboarding, offboarding, and training experiences\n Monitoring engagement and surfacing retention risks\n Assisting in workforce planning and modeling [...] When deployed properly, AI agents open up capacity for HR teams to be more strategic and build better relationships. Agents can handle the administrative load without requiring constant oversight, which allows HR professionals to focus on more complex, human-centric responsibilities like coaching, retention, and culture. In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them. [...] ### 2. Employee Engagement and Workforce Management\n\nOnce an employee is hired, agents can support them throughout the onboarding journey. Provisioning, policy acknowledgment, training reminders, and basic Q&amp;A can all be handled by AI agents acting as always-on support. Agents can also personalize the employee onboarding experience based on role, region, or manager, ensuring consistency without sacrificing nuance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;According to the Workday research, 83% of workers believe that AI can boost their careers by helping them develop new skills in their roles and focus on more meaningful work. These findings reflect a growing shift: AI agents are not just tools of efficiency, but enablers of deeper human contribution.\n\nRather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work. [...] &gt; Leaders should map potential AI agent use cases using two key factors: strategic value and readiness for automation.\n\n## How to Select Agentic AI Use Cases\n\nWhile agentic AI systems are increasingly powerful, their impact depends on how thoughtfully they are applied. Choosing the right use cases is one of the most important steps in any agent deployment strategy.\n\nIdentifying the right AI agent functionality for your business is not just about what can be automated—it’s about where agents can deliver meaningful business value with clarity and control.\n\nThe best use cases tend to share three characteristics:\n\n Clear goals that agents can pursue autonomously\n Access to clean, structured data\n Repeatable logic that guides decisions or actions [...] Several core capabilities make an AI system agentic:\n\n Autonomy: The ability to operate independently within defined boundaries, without constant human instruction.\n Goal orientation: Agents pursue clear outcomes, evaluating actions based on how well they advance those goals.\n Adaptability: They monitor real-time inputs and adjust decisions dynamically as context shifts.\n Reasoning: Agents assess trade-offs, apply rules or models, and choose actions that reflect logical prioritization.\n Learning: Some agents can refine their behavior over time by analyzing the outcomes of past decisions.\n Collaboration: In multi-agent systems, agents coordinate and share knowledge to solve problems collectively.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI can help deliver transformative value across various stages of the risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to risk review and reporting. Here are some not-so-obvious use cases your organization can start exploring right now: AI use cases through the risk management lifecycle Risk identification: AI can generate process flows, detect emerging risks, and recommend mappings to risk taxonomies, processes, and controls. This helps organizations identify risks more accurately and earlier.\nRisk assessment: AI can recommend risk ratings, generate and monitor key risk indicators, and calculate residual risk. By making risk assessment more probabilistic, AI can enhance the precision and consistency of risk ratings. [...] KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] Pilot with purpose: Don’t try to boil the ocean. Choose one or two high-impact use cases and run parallel pilots. Compare AI-driven outcomes to traditional methods. If the results are as good, or better, then use that evidence to build internal confidence and regulatory credibility. Tip: Learn from early adopters in credit and fraud risk. Their success with AI-powered decisioning has already earned regulatory comfort.&quot;,

Learn more here.\n\n### How we use AI\n\n## Turnkey Solution [...] With the Immediate and ADP Vantage HCM® integration, customers can easily implement the Immediate earned wage access (EWA) solution. Our approach to earned wage access does not disrupt a company&#x27;s payroll or time tracking process and Immediate is a zero-cost benefit to the employer. With the ADP Vantage HCM® integration, your team can begin offering EWA in as little as one hour.\nWhen the workday ends, Immediate&#x27;s AI compares employee shift history with new work log items to verify time worked. Team members then have access to their earned but not yet paid wages through the ImmediatePay app. The integration with ADP Vantage HCM® allows Immediate to see real-time data and provide an automatic deduction file for the next pay period. Immediate is then reimbursed through the payroll process. [...] The Immediate application integrates with ADP to provide earned wage access to your employees. This is a real-time integration that pushes the details to and from the Immediate platform and integrates the data in and out of ADP Vantage HCM. The Immediate integration fully automates bringing your employee census and time data to the Immediate platform in real time. Once your pay period closes the Immediate platform writes back payroll deductions to the ADP system so that it fits seamlessly into your payroll workflow.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Automating AWS Infrastructure Creation with Amazon Bedrock Agent&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By integrating AWS Bedrock, Lambda, and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, this solution leverages the full power of automation, eliminating manual steps while ensuring that cloud environments are provisioned securely and efficiently. The Bedrock Agentic interface takes user input and translates it into real-time infrastructure actions, making cloud management much more accessible and responsive. [...] With the deployment steps and testing guidance outlined, you are now equipped to test and deploy this fully automated system. The Bedrock Agentic feature not only simplifies cloud resource provisioning but also reduces human error, ensuring a smooth and reliable cloud infrastructure setup. By automating the management of your AWS resources, you can scale your cloud environment quickly, securely, and with minimal effort. [...] 5. Test Additional Commands\n\nTo further test the solution, try adding more complex requests. For example:\n\nThe agent should handle these requests by invoking the appropriate Lambda functions defined in the CloudFormation template.\n\nExample test command to create a subnet:\n\nplease create a public and a private subnet with equal cidr in us gov west 1a\n\n6. Troubleshooting\n\nConclusion\n\nThe AWS Bedrock Agentic feature allows for dynamic, serverless infrastructure management by automating the process of provisioning resources based on user inputs. With Bedrock&#x27;s ability to process natural language requests, you can easily deploy, manage, and modify AWS resources such as VPCs, EC2 instances, and security groups — all triggered by simple commands.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation behind the scenes. By enabling agents to work together, you can achieve higher task success rates, accuracy, and enhanced productivity. In internal benchmark testing, multi-agent collaboration has shown marked improvements compared to single-agent systems for handling complex, multi-step tasks. [...] With the fully managed multi-agent collaboration capability on Amazon Bedrock, specialized agents work within their domains of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization. [...] I select the content-strategist agent and provide the collaborator name `content-strategist` along with the following instruction:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media content strategy tasks such as converting business goals into engaging social posts. The agent generates creative, on-brand content ideas that align with specified campaign goals and target audience.`\n\nThen, I choose Add collaborator, select the engagement-predictor agent, and provide the collaborator name `engagement-predictor` along with the following instructions:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media analytics to predict post performance and optimal timing.`&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock now supports multi-agent collaboration - AWS&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Amazon Bedrock now supports multi-agent collaboration\n\nPosted on: Mar 10, 2025\n\nToday, AWS announces the general availability (GA) of multi-agent collaboration for Amazon Bedrock, allowing developers to create networks of specialized agents that communicate and coordinate under the guidance of a supervisor agent. This new capability allows you to tackle more intricate, multi-step workflows and scale your AI-driven applications more effectively. [...] This release also introduces agent monitoring and observability features, helping you track, monitor, and optimize agent interactions more efficiently. These features improve debugging and traceability, ensuring better visibility into agent workflows and making troubleshooting easier for developers.\n\nMulti-agent collaboration on Amazon Bedrock is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported. To learn more about this feature and how it can help you build more sophisticated AI applications, see the Amazon Bedrock product page or refer to the documentation for detailed information on getting started. [...] Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration GA introduces key enhancements designed to improve scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency. Inline Agents allow you to dynamically adjust agent roles and behaviors at runtime, making workflows more adaptable as your business needs evolve. With Payload Referencing, supervisor agents can reference linked data instead of embedding it in every request, reducing data transfer, improving response times, and lowering operational costs. Additionally, multi-agent now offers CloudFormation (CFN) and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) support so you can create reusable teams of agents as templates that can be shared across accounts within an organization.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Read more\n\n### How is AI transforming business functions?\n\nOne-third (34%) of surveyed organisations are starting to use AI to deeply transform—creating new products and services or reinventing core processes or business models. Another third (30%) are redesigning key processes around AI. The remaining third (37%) are using AI at a more surface level, with little or no change to existing processes. While each are capturing productivity and efficiency gains, only the first group are truly reimagining their businesses rather than optimising what already exists.\n\nAdditionally, different types of AI technologies yield different expectations for impact.  \n Generative AI (GenAI): The areas of GenAI that leaders believe will have the most impactful effects on their industries are: [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes. [...] Leaders are enabling modular, cloud-native platforms that securely connect, govern, and integrate all data types. They break down silos with domain-owned data products and embed privacy, sovereignty, and security-by-design while enforcing enterprise standards for quality, interoperability and lineage.\n A unified, trusted data strategy is indispensable. Forward-thinking organisations converge operational, experiential, and external data flows and invest in evolving platforms that anticipate the needs of emerging AI.\n\n#### AI change management\n\nRead more\n\n### AI change management: How do I prepare my workforce for AI?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Future of connected AI agents\n\nImage showing two people greeting each other\n\nSupercharge developers. Govern and orchestrate agents.\n\nGetting started Community Training Tutorials Documentation\n\n© Copyright 2026 Salesforce, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n# Workday HCM Integration Solutions\n\nDiscover how connecting Workday HCM across your enterprise creates a complete employee view and eliminates manual data entry.\n\nWorkday offers a number of applications to help businesses keep processes running - none more important than the Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) Suite. As businesses evolve and adopt a “best of breed” approach to their enterprise ecosystem, Workday HCM integration with various applications, systems, services and APIs throughout the enterprise is crucial. [...] Many of these systems and applications can be easily integrated natively through Workday, yet many of them require some sort of integration tool be put in place. Businesses have tried to overcome integration challenges by creating custom connectivity and implementing point-to-point integration. This approach applies custom code directly between two endpoints, creating a tightly coupled dependency between them. Although this solution creates connectivity between endpoints, it is limited in complexity due to its fragile nature. Moreover, this method is not future proof; as more and more endpoints need to be integrated, the ecosystem becomes increasingly complex and fragile. [...] ## HCM and Integration Needs\n\nWorkday’s HCM Suite covers an extensive number of applications that merge human resources, talent management, recruiting, benefits and more into a single platform.\n\nWorkday’s HCM Suite helps companies keep their business running, however, today, digital transformation is disrupting the way in which organizations are set up. Businesses are adopting a “best of breed” approach in which they employ applications, systems, and services that have been identified as the best of their type. This method has caused an explosion of endpoints, data sources, and APIs throughout the enterprise, all equally important in helping run the enterprise.\n\n## Common Challenges of HR Integration&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Govern the new risks: Biased algorithms. Privacy violations. Inaccurate outputs. Compromised models. AI is powerful, but without governance, it’s just another risk. Build controls to help monitor these risks just as rigorously as you would any other, strive to ensure human oversight where it matters most, and design escalation paths when AI goes off-script. Tip: Take a look at the KPMG AI risk and controls guide to start designing practical controls to help manage your organization’s AI risks. AI is not just a tool for risk management; it is a helpful catalyst for transformation. By moving from siloed solutions to integrated and agentic AI, risk teams can move from hindsight to foresight — spotting emerging threats, modeling complex scenarios, and Conclusion: AI is a helpful catalyst for [...] KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] Risk mitigation: AI tools can support decision-making around risk response strategies and automate or enhance mitigation actions. For instance, they can identify issues and root causes, review and design control inventories, and monitor alerts more efficiently and precisely.\nRisk monitoring: AI enables real-time or continuous monitoring of risk indicators, producing aggregated reporting and moving from point-in-time reporting to more dynamic, real-time capabilities.\nRisk review and reporting: AI helps improve the efficiency and quality of risk reporting by automating the generation of reports, thematic analysis, and standardized risk and control report outputs.&quot;,

[...] In today&#x27;s fast-paced corporate world, data security and trade secrets are critical and competitors are doing whatever they can to find an edge. This ultimately means businesses must do whatever they can to protect their own interests.\n\nOne such way that employers look to achieve this competitive edge is through a contractual mechanism called &#x27;gardening leave&#x27;, which acts as a contractual provision that prevents employees from working during their notice period whilst keeping them on full pay.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave refers to the period during which an employee who has resigned or been terminated remains on the company payroll but is not required to be at the workplace or continue working on any projects related to their role. [...] ### Can a company legally force gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave cannot be legally forced by an employer unless the employment contract explicitly states this as a condition. However, if no gardening leave clause exists, the employer has no choice but to either allow the employee to work their agreed notice period or move to negotiate a mutual agreement that is fair to both parties.\n\nWithout a contractual provision, attempting to impose gardening leave could constitute a breach of contract, giving the employee grounds to resign and claim constructive dismissal.\n\n### Should you include a gardening leave clause in your employment contracts?&quot;,

Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills, [...] Many organizations run on hybrid models that were never designed: project teams layered over product teams layered over business lines, with no clear decision rights and thin enterprise architecture (EA) capability. Talent is skewed toward keeping legacy systems alive, with limited capacity for innovation, data, and AI. Several leaders are also facing cost constraints, static or shrinking headcount, and cultural resistance to new ways of working or to AI-driven change.\n\nFrom guidance kickoff (GKO) conversations, three initiative patterns recur when CIOs talk about evolving operating models and talent:&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

Bhusri Is Back Behind The Workday Wheel\n\nAkshara Naik Lopez    2 days ago\n\nWhat We Know Workday just announced its new CEO, and, well, he isn’t really new at all. Aneel Bhusri is returning as CEO after two years as executive chair. The move follows a turbulent period for enterprise SaaS stocks, with Workday shares down more than 20% year-to-date (2026) and significantly declining since the start of 2025, […]\n\nRead More\n\nBlog\n\n## US Insurance Tech Spending 2026: From Modernization To Intelligence\n\nDavid Hoffman    5 days ago [...] These initiatives put operating models and talent at the heart of how CIOs turn strategy into business outcomes. These moves align with what we call the operating model step in our value cocreation research, where leaders use operating model and skill changes as their primary lever to move from plans to measurable business impact.\n\nIn the final part of this series, I’ll share how these same CIOs are connecting security, cost, and value to the board, because none of these changes stick without a compelling narrative and evidence base for executive stakeholders.\n\n###### Categories\n\n CIO insights\n\n### Get The Insights At Work Newsletter\n\n### Thanks for signing up.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.\n\n### AI Isn’t A Hardware Contest — It’s A Human Test [...] Rebalance technology talent for an AI-enabled future. Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills,&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Mondelez approaches AI adoption through two lenses: everyday productivity tools for employees and deliberate enterprise-scale game changers that transform manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Governance is central, with a global AI board ensuring ethical use, bias control, and consumer data stewardship. Capability building spans both technology and business functions, supported by structured upskilling programs and internal platforms like Workday. When integrating AI into legacy operations, Anand stresses that people and data matter more than systems, strong change management and data governance are critical.

Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills, [...] Many organizations run on hybrid models that were never designed: project teams layered over product teams layered over business lines, with no clear decision rights and thin enterprise architecture (EA) capability. Talent is skewed toward keeping legacy systems alive, with limited capacity for innovation, data, and AI. Several leaders are also facing cost constraints, static or shrinking headcount, and cultural resistance to new ways of working or to AI-driven change.\n\nFrom guidance kickoff (GKO) conversations, three initiative patterns recur when CIOs talk about evolving operating models and talent:&quot;,

Understanding gardening leave in Hong Kong. [...] In today&#x27;s fast-paced corporate world, data security and trade secrets are critical and competitors are doing whatever they can to find an edge. This ultimately means businesses must do whatever they can to protect their own interests.\n\nOne such way that employers look to achieve this competitive edge is through a contractual mechanism called &#x27;gardening leave&#x27;, which acts as a contractual provision that prevents employees from working during their notice period whilst keeping them on full pay.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave refers to the period during which an employee who has resigned or been terminated remains on the company payroll but is not required to be at the workplace or continue working on any projects related to their role.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;CIO Leadership Live ASEAN: Scaling AI Responsibly at ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Mondelez approaches AI adoption through two lenses: everyday productivity tools for employees and deliberate enterprise-scale game changers that transform manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Governance is central, with a global AI board ensuring ethical use, bias control, and consumer data stewardship. Capability building spans both technology and business functions, supported by structured upskilling programs and internal platforms like Workday. When integrating AI into legacy operations, Anand stresses that people and data matter more than systems, strong change management and data governance are critical.

Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills,&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] AI can help deliver transformative value across various stages of the risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to risk review and reporting. Here are some not-so-obvious use cases your organization can start exploring right now: AI use cases through the risk management lifecycle Risk identification: AI can generate process flows, detect emerging risks, and recommend mappings to risk taxonomies, processes, and controls. This helps organizations identify risks more accurately and earlier.\nRisk assessment: AI can recommend risk ratings, generate and monitor key risk indicators, and calculate residual risk. By making risk assessment more probabilistic, AI can enhance the precision and consistency of risk ratings. [...] Risk mitigation: AI tools can support decision-making around risk response strategies and automate or enhance mitigation actions. For instance, they can identify issues and root causes, review and design control inventories, and monitor alerts more efficiently and precisely.\nRisk monitoring: AI enables real-time or continuous monitoring of risk indicators, producing aggregated reporting and moving from point-in-time reporting to more dynamic, real-time capabilities.\nRisk review and reporting: AI helps improve the efficiency and quality of risk reporting by automating the generation of reports, thematic analysis, and standardized risk and control report outputs.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

See how people, skills, operating models, and culture — not more tech — unlock the value your AI investments are missing.\n\nGet The Human + AI Guide\n\nBlog\n\n## Hello Again! Bhusri Is Back Behind The Workday Wheel\n\nAkshara Naik Lopez    2 days ago\n\nWhat We Know Workday just announced its new CEO, and, well, he isn’t really new at all.

Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale. [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Mondelez approaches AI adoption through two lenses: everyday productivity tools for employees and deliberate enterprise-scale game changers that transform manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Governance is central, with a global AI board ensuring ethical use, bias control, and consumer data stewardship. Capability building spans both technology and business functions, supported by structured upskilling programs and internal platforms like Workday. When integrating AI into legacy operations, Anand stresses that people and data matter more than systems, strong change management and data governance are critical.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] AI can help deliver transformative value across various stages of the risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to risk review and reporting. Here are some not-so-obvious use cases your organization can start exploring right now: AI use cases through the risk management lifecycle Risk identification: AI can generate process flows, detect emerging risks, and recommend mappings to risk taxonomies, processes, and controls. This helps organizations identify risks more accurately and earlier.\nRisk assessment: AI can recommend risk ratings, generate and monitor key risk indicators, and calculate residual risk. By making risk assessment more probabilistic, AI can enhance the precision and consistency of risk ratings. [...] Risk mitigation: AI tools can support decision-making around risk response strategies and automate or enhance mitigation actions. For instance, they can identify issues and root causes, review and design control inventories, and monitor alerts more efficiently and precisely.\nRisk monitoring: AI enables real-time or continuous monitoring of risk indicators, producing aggregated reporting and moving from point-in-time reporting to more dynamic, real-time capabilities.\nRisk review and reporting: AI helps improve the efficiency and quality of risk reporting by automating the generation of reports, thematic analysis, and standardized risk and control report outputs.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

Understanding gardening leave in Hong Kong. [...] In today&#x27;s fast-paced corporate world, data security and trade secrets are critical and competitors are doing whatever they can to find an edge. This ultimately means businesses must do whatever they can to protect their own interests.\n\nOne such way that employers look to achieve this competitive edge is through a contractual mechanism called &#x27;gardening leave&#x27;, which acts as a contractual provision that prevents employees from working during their notice period whilst keeping them on full pay.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave refers to the period during which an employee who has resigned or been terminated remains on the company payroll but is not required to be at the workplace or continue working on any projects related to their role.&quot;,

The move follows a turbulent period for enterprise SaaS stocks, with Workday shares down more than 20% year-to-date (2026) and significantly declining since the start of 2025, […]\n\nRead More\n\nBlog\n\n## US Insurance Tech Spending 2026: From Modernization To Intelligence\n\nDavid Hoffman    5 days ago [...] These initiatives put operating models and talent at the heart of how CIOs turn strategy into business outcomes. These moves align with what we call the operating model step in our value cocreation research, where leaders use operating model and skill changes as their primary lever to move from plans to measurable business impact.\n\nIn the final part of this series, I’ll share how these same CIOs are connecting security, cost, and value to the board, because none of these changes stick without a compelling narrative and evidence base for executive stakeholders.\n\n###### Categories\n\n CIO insights\n\n### Get The Insights At Work Newsletter\n\n### Thanks for signing up.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.\n\n### AI Isn’t A Hardware Contest — It’s A Human Test [...] Rebalance technology talent for an AI-enabled future. Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills,&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] AI can help deliver transformative value across various stages of the risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to risk review and reporting. Here are some not-so-obvious use cases your organization can start exploring right now: AI use cases through the risk management lifecycle Risk identification: AI can generate process flows, detect emerging risks, and recommend mappings to risk taxonomies, processes, and controls. This helps organizations identify risks more accurately and earlier.\nRisk assessment: AI can recommend risk ratings, generate and monitor key risk indicators, and calculate residual risk. By making risk assessment more probabilistic, AI can enhance the precision and consistency of risk ratings. [...] Risk mitigation: AI tools can support decision-making around risk response strategies and automate or enhance mitigation actions. For instance, they can identify issues and root causes, review and design control inventories, and monitor alerts more efficiently and precisely.\nRisk monitoring: AI enables real-time or continuous monitoring of risk indicators, producing aggregated reporting and moving from point-in-time reporting to more dynamic, real-time capabilities.\nRisk review and reporting: AI helps improve the efficiency and quality of risk reporting by automating the generation of reports, thematic analysis, and standardized risk and control report outputs.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale. [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

Understanding gardening leave in Hong Kong. [...] In today&#x27;s fast-paced corporate world, data security and trade secrets are critical and competitors are doing whatever they can to find an edge. This ultimately means businesses must do whatever they can to protect their own interests.\n\nOne such way that employers look to achieve this competitive edge is through a contractual mechanism called &#x27;gardening leave&#x27;, which acts as a contractual provision that prevents employees from working during their notice period whilst keeping them on full pay.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave refers to the period during which an employee who has resigned or been terminated remains on the company payroll but is not required to be at the workplace or continue working on any projects related to their role.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale. [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Mondelez approaches AI adoption through two lenses: everyday productivity tools for employees and deliberate enterprise-scale game changers that transform manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Governance is central, with a global AI board ensuring ethical use, bias control, and consumer data stewardship. Capability building spans both technology and business functions, supported by structured upskilling programs and internal platforms like Workday. When integrating AI into legacy operations, Anand stresses that people and data matter more than systems, strong change management and data governance are critical. Looking ahead, FMCG players can collaborate on standards and share data responsibly while competing in the marketplace.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task. [...] AI can help deliver transformative value across various stages of the risk management lifecycle, from risk identification to risk review and reporting. Here are some not-so-obvious use cases your organization can start exploring right now: AI use cases through the risk management lifecycle Risk identification: AI can generate process flows, detect emerging risks, and recommend mappings to risk taxonomies, processes, and controls. This helps organizations identify risks more accurately and earlier.\nRisk assessment: AI can recommend risk ratings, generate and monitor key risk indicators, and calculate residual risk. By making risk assessment more probabilistic, AI can enhance the precision and consistency of risk ratings. [...] Risk mitigation: AI tools can support decision-making around risk response strategies and automate or enhance mitigation actions. For instance, they can identify issues and root causes, review and design control inventories, and monitor alerts more efficiently and precisely.\nRisk monitoring: AI enables real-time or continuous monitoring of risk indicators, producing aggregated reporting and moving from point-in-time reporting to more dynamic, real-time capabilities.\nRisk review and reporting: AI helps improve the efficiency and quality of risk reporting by automating the generation of reports, thematic analysis, and standardized risk and control report outputs.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale. [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes.&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

Understanding gardening leave in Hong Kong. [...] In today&#x27;s fast-paced corporate world, data security and trade secrets are critical and competitors are doing whatever they can to find an edge. This ultimately means businesses must do whatever they can to protect their own interests.\n\nOne such way that employers look to achieve this competitive edge is through a contractual mechanism called &#x27;gardening leave&#x27;, which acts as a contractual provision that prevents employees from working during their notice period whilst keeping them on full pay.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is gardening leave?\n\nGardening leave refers to the period during which an employee who has resigned or been terminated remains on the company payroll but is not required to be at the workplace or continue working on any projects related to their role.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### AI Isn’t A Hardware Contest — It’s A Human Test\n\n#### Most orgs get less than 50% ROI on AI. See how people, skills, operating models, and culture — not more tech — unlock the value your AI investments are missing.\n\nGet The Human + AI Guide\n\nBlog\n\n## Hello Again! Bhusri Is Back Behind The Workday Wheel\n\nAkshara Naik Lopez    2 days ago\n\nWhat We Know Workday just announced its new CEO, and, well, he isn’t really new at all. Aneel Bhusri is returning as CEO after two years as executive chair. The move follows a turbulent period for enterprise SaaS stocks, with Workday shares down more than 20% year-to-date (2026) and significantly declining since the start of 2025, […]\n\nRead More\n\nBlog\n\n## US Insurance Tech Spending 2026: From Modernization To Intelligence\n\nDavid Hoffman    5 days ago [...] Rebalance technology talent for an AI-enabled future. Talent is a major constraint across APAC and Europe. Several CIOs describe IT workforces heavily skewed toward maintaining legacy systems, with aging skills on mainframe or niche platforms and limited internal capacity for data science or AI engineering. A regional bank, for example, is creating a new workforce management function that spans enterprise architecture, financial rigor on tech spend, and talent planning. A university CIO is hiring for new enterprise architecture and emerging technology roles. In parallel, several firms hit by cyberattacks are using resilience programs as a catalyst to rebalance teams toward centralized security, platform engineering, and automation skills. CIOs are shifting the mix of skills, [...] These initiatives put operating models and talent at the heart of how CIOs turn strategy into business outcomes. These moves align with what we call the operating model step in our value cocreation research, where leaders use operating model and skill changes as their primary lever to move from plans to measurable business impact.\n\nIn the final part of this series, I’ll share how these same CIOs are connecting security, cost, and value to the board, because none of these changes stick without a compelling narrative and evidence base for executive stakeholders.\n\n###### Categories\n\n CIO insights\n\n### Get The Insights At Work Newsletter\n\n### Thanks for signing up.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.\n\n### AI Isn’t A Hardware Contest — It’s A Human Test&quot;,

Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \&quot;thought tokens\&quot; to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n ​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n ​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds. [...] ​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n\n### ​The engine for the next wave of growth&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes. [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Search and knowledge management\n Virtual assistants/chatbots\n Content generation\n\nAgentic AI: While agentic AI is expected to have the highest impact in customer support, use cases for supply chain management, R&amp;D, knowledge management, and cybersecurity are also seen as having particularly high potential. The enterprises we interviewed are deploying autonomous AI agents across multiple functions: [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes. [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Finding the key to the AI agent control plane | InfoWorld&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The press and analyst commentary immediately reached for the same metaphor: It looks like HR for AI coworkers. Even The Verge picked up OpenAI’s language about being inspired by how enterprises scale people. Outlets covering Frontier emphasized that it is assigning identities and permissions to agents rather than letting them roam free. Then, almost on cue, OpenAI followed with Lockdown Mode, a security posture designed to reduce prompt-injection-driven data exfiltration by constraining how ChatGPT interacts with external systems. [...] I’ve been arguing for a while that the AI story developers should care about is not replacement but management. If AI is the intern, you are the manager. That is true for code generation, and it is even more true for autonomous systems that can take actions across your stack. The corollary is uncomfortable but unavoidable: If we are “hiring” synthetic employees, we need the equivalent of HR, identity access management (IAM), and internal controls to keep them in check.\n\n## All hail the control plane [...] We are currently in the “Wild West” phase of agent deployment. It’s exciting, but boy, is it stressful if you’re an enterprise that wants to deploy agents safely at scale. Developers are chaining agents together with frameworks, wiring them into enterprise apps, and giving them broad scopes because it is the fastest way to get a demo working. The result isn’t just spaghetti code. It is spaghetti logic. You end up with a swarm of semi-autonomous systems passing state back and forth, with no clean audit trail of who authorized what.\n\nThis is where trust collapses, and where costs mushroom.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The enterprise AI land grab is on. Glean is building the layer ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”\n\nHe says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic.\n\n“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.” [...] Boston, MA | June 23, 2026\n\nREGISTER NOW\n\nFirst is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That’s why Jain says he doesn’t see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners.\n\n“Our product gets better because we’re able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said.\n\nSecond are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools.\n\nAnd third, and perhaps most important, is governance.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;He said users want agents that help make decisions, but they will want to intervene, ask what-if questions, test counterfactuals and see what happens if conditions change. He said trust is the currency of ROI for enterprise AI because decisions are consequential, must be explained and justified, trigger actions and investments, and invite scrutiny from regulators, risk and compliance teams. He said this drives a layered architecture in 2026, anchored in explainability, so decisions can be verified, traced and trusted enough for enterprise requirements.\n\nHe said the agentic AI ROI ramp erodes unless trust is engineered into the architecture, and winners won’t be those with the most agents, but those with the most decision-grade outcomes per agent.\n\nHe summarized the arc as: [...] Fourteen years into the modern AI era, our research indicates AI is maturing rapidly. The data suggests we are entering the enterprise productivity phase, where we move beyond the novelty of retrieval-augmented-generation-based chatbots and agentic experimentation. In our view, 2026 will be remembered as the year that kicked off decades of enterprise AI value creation.\n\nWe can’t promise that it won’t be messy.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;OpenAI hires OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger in push toward ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The move follows a remarkable few months for OpenClaw, as what began as an ambitious open-source personal agent project rapidly evolved into one of the most talked-about frameworks in AI.\n\nOpenClaw has attracted tens of thousands of developers and surged in GitHub stars as interest in multi-agent systems has exploded. The project tapped into a growing desire among enterprises and independent builders for AI agents that can reason across steps, call external services and operate semi-independently rather than simply generate text: agents that can actually do things. [...] The concept of agentic AI has become a focal point for both startups and major labs, which see agents as a path toward more durable enterprise value and deeper integration into daily workflows. Although billions have flown into companies pursuing agentic AI, Steinberger came up the middle with a personally coded solution that didn’t require venture capital largesse to deliver. Better still, from a user perspective, it’s offered as open source.\n\nFor OpenAI, bringing Steinberger on board signals an acceleration of its own agent ambitions. OpenAI gains not only technical expertise by hiring the creator of one of the most visible open-source agent frameworks but also credibility within a developer community that has increasingly rallied around open, modular approaches to AI orchestration.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Build a scalable architecture: As pilots succeed, expand AI integration across risk and resilience frameworks. Connect point solutions into end-to-end workflows, align with your GRC systems, and ensure your data infrastructure can support real-time, intelligent decision-making. For success as you scale, you’ll need an ecosystem view of your full AI environment and capabilities to help ensure AI agents are integrated, workflows are resilient, and decision making is based on sound data. Tip: Make sure strategy and actions steadily move you from siloed to agentic AI, where systems act autonomously and humans intervene only when needed. [...] Meaningful opportunities lie ahead for those willing to lean into AI to help enhance centralization and automation across disconnected risk functions, such as enterprise risk management (ERM), third-party risk management (TPRM), regulatory reporting, anti-money laundering (AML) and other compliance, and know your customer (KYC) and client onboarding practices. As organizations mature their AI capabilities, AI becomes more integrated — connecting broad risk activities and embedding intelligence into the core of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems. This integration not only strengthens second line oversight but also accelerates first line activities that are traditionally time-consuming, enabling the first line to act with greater confidence and agility. As a result, [...] KPMG Workbench KPMG has collaborated with Microsoft to build KPMG Workbench on Microsoft Azure AI Foundry services, allowing for interoperable, agent-to-agent communications. In addition, it brings together capabilities from across the KPMG ecosystem of alliance partners, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce and Workday, so clients accessing it can choose the model or AI agent that fits their task.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;is available in all repositories stored on GitHub, except repositories owned by managed user accounts and where it has been explicitly disabled. An Agent Skill is created to teach Copilot on performing specialized tasks with detailed instructions while also being repeatable. At its core, Agent Skills are folders which contain instructions, scripts, and resources that the Copilot automatically loads when relevant to the query. On receiving a prompt, Copilot determines if a skill is relevant to your task and it then loads the instructions. The skills instructions are executed along with any resources included in the directory structure relevant to the specific skill. One guideline would be to encapsulate into a skill anything which is being done repeatedly. In the example below, we have a [...] setting to use Agent Skills prior to the run. An Agent can have nested agents which is used to detail sub agents (Nested Agents is also enabled in settings as shown below) and thus decouple functionality. Any prompt in the chat will now have the option to pick from the Agent Skills in addition to the tools available. We can write our own skills, or use those which are shared by others - anthropics/skills repository or GitHub’s community created github/awesome-copilot collection. While skills are very powerful, using shared skills needs to be done with discretion and from a security perspective only use skills shared by trusted sources.

In Agent Playground, I can successfully start a new chat and have the agent generate a chart/image using Code Interpreter. This works as expected in both the old and new Foundry experiences. However, after publishing the agent to Copilot/Teams for my organization, the same prompt that works in Agent Playground does not function properly. The agent appears to execute the code, but the image is not accessible in Teams. When reviewing the agent traces (via the Traces tab in Foundry), I can see that the agent generates a link to the image in the Code Interpreter sandbox environment, for example: `[Download the bar chart` This works correctly within Foundry, but the&quot;,

Emotion AI is used in healthcare for diagnostics and in marketing for neuromarketing strategies that gauge product reactions. Its ability to analyze emotional signals across multiple modalities allows businesses to refine their approaches and improve customer retention and satisfaction.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale. [...] Educating the broader workforce to raise overall AI fluency (53%)\n Designing and implementing upskilling and reskilling strategies (48%)\n Assessing target talent acquisition levels and hiring specialised talent to drive AI initiatives (36%)\n Redesigning career paths and career mobility strategies (33%)\n Assessing changes to the anticipated supply and demand of skills (30%)\n Providing performance-based incentives for leveraging AI (30%)\n Combining or reimagining organisations based on new patterns resulting from AI usage (30%)\n Measuring worker trust and engagement (30%)\n Changing the balance between full-time, contract, and gig workers (19%) [...] While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could&quot;,

A user uploads a quarterly report and asks: \&quot;What are the top three expense categories?\&quot; Behind the scenes, your agent parses the spreadsheet, aggregates thousands of rows, and generates visualizations. All in 20 seconds. But the user? They see a loading spinner. Nothing else. No \&quot;reading file\&quot; message, no \&quot;analyzing data\&quot; indicator, no hint that progress is being made. They start wondering: Is it frozen? Should I refresh? The problem isn&#x27;t the agent&#x27;s capabilities - it&#x27;s the communication gap between the agent running on the backend and the user interface.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The State of AI in the Enterprise - 2026 AI report | Deloitte Australia&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While most are focused on educating employees, far fewer are re-architecting roles, workflows, and career paths. The most successful organisations reimagine jobs to seamlessly combine human strengths and AI capabilities, ensuring both aspects are used to their fullest potential. New roles—AI operations managers, human-AI interaction specialists, quality stewards, and others—signal a deeper shift: AI is now a structural component of how work is organised. Advanced organisations streamline workflows that AI can execute end-to-end, while humans focus on judgement, exception handling, and strategic oversight. The goal isn&#x27;t replacing humans or merely assisting them, but creating complementary working relationships between humans and AI—where the combined output exceeds what either could [...] A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes. [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;[PDF] Gigafactory provides more intelligent manufacturing for PECNA&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“We made sure we were clearly communicating to the business and our technologists why the clean core was important,” he said. “We produce six million batteries per day, so we cannot afford downtime as we upgrade a system.” PECNA uses SAP Business Technology Platform extensively and it has been a game changer for keeping the core clean and automating processes. It also helped to connect the AIP platform to the ERP, so they are harmonized to create a smart factory. Now PECNA is looking at moving into the agentic AI era with its data and AIP platforms. For example, creating co-pilots for HR could add value to the business, or platforms could be augmented with humanoid robots in manufacturing. [...] About Capgemini Capgemini is a global business and technology transformation partner, helping organizations to accelerate their dual transition to a digital and sustainable world, while creating tangible impact for enterprises and society. It is a responsible and diverse group of 340,000 team members in more than 50 countries. With its strong over 55-year heritage, Capgemini is trusted by its clients to unlock the value of technology to address the entire breadth of their business needs. It delivers end-to-end services and solutions leveraging strengths from strategy and design to engineering, all fueled by its market leading capabilities in AI, generative AI, cloud and data, combined with its deep industry expertise and partner ecosystem. The Group reported 2024 global revenues of €22.1 [...] “It’s a fast-paced world and we have to be agile in everything we do,” he said. “Our transactional database is quite extensive at PECNA, so we needed to be able to take that and marry it into artificial intelligence platforms (AIPs) and extract value for the business.” The challenges for the technology team were twofold. First, multiple disparate data sources at its gigafactory needed to be consolidated. And the second was how to leverage technology to improve processes and the end-user experience. PECNA needed greater data visibility so it could reduce lead times and increase cash flow for different areas of the business. This process simplification would also allow employees to leverage automation and focus on more value-added activities.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A financial services company is building agentic workflows to automatically capture meeting actions from video conferences, draft communications to remind participants of their next steps, and track follow-through.\n An air carrier is using AI agents to help customers complete the most common transactions, such as rebooking a flight or rerouting bags, freeing up human agents to address more complex matters.\n A manufacturer is using AI agents to support new product development initiatives, leveraging AI to find the optimal balance between competing objectives such as cost and time-to-market.\n In the public sector, AI agents are being used to cover workforce shortages, partnering with human workers to complete key processes. [...] Organisational structures are beginning to flatten as AI absorbs routine execution tasks. Some companies are merging technology and people-leadership functions to ensure that systems and workforce design evolve together. The pace of AI change management varies by industry, but the direction is consistent: Roles, skills, and career paths should be rebuilt, not simply adjusted. Organisations should take an AI-native approach and redesign work holistically rather than layering AI onto legacy processes.\n\n### Key findings from this year&#x27;s AI report\n\nSkip to description)\n\n Share\n\n# Discover Agentic AI\n\nLearn how Deloitte can help your organisation blend human expertise and autonomous intelligence, rethink business functions, drive smarter decisions, and generate value at scale.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Agentic AI is redefining HR and workforce strategies | EY - India&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;EY.AI podcast talks about “Agentic AI and the future of work”, about how Agentic AI is changing HR and workforce strategies. In the latest episode of EY.AI Unplugged Season 2: AI Agents of impact, a part of the EY India Insights podcast series, Anurag Malik, Partner and Leader of People Advisory Services at EY India, talks about “Agentic AI and the future of work”, about how Agentic AI is changing HR and workforce strategies. The discussion highlights the influence of  autonomous AI systems on talent identification, simplifying HR processes and supporting leaders with data-driven insights while maintaining human judgment. Anurag further explains the EY four-persona framework for building AI skills across organizations and practical steps for HR leaders to integrate AI into daily work. * Agentic AI can move high-potential talent decisions from intuition to structured, data-based insights. * Many organizations are at present following a four-persona framework for AI capability-building (Ambassador, Translator, Specialist, Aspirant). Welcome to the EY.AI Unplugged Season 2: AI agents of impact, a special series by EY India Insights. Anurag, to begin with, how is Agentic AI changing the way organizations identify and assess high-potential talent? In EY we have a platform, an Agentic AI enabled platform called EY Competency Connect to bring behavioral, functional and technical data together to provide deeper insights, enabling organizations to take a high-potential talent decision. We are also seeing that while the trend is very clear in terms of using Agentic AI — selection, performance and high-potential career decisions — organizations need to be careful that the underlying quality of data that enables these decision has to be credible. Pivoting towards our firm&#x27;s efforts, how is EY helping organizations make significant investments for building AI capability at scale? It is the leadership layer of the organization where AI capability-building needs to be focused on building strategic AI capabilities, helping leaders understand the best practices in their sector globally for AI use cases and ensuring they become ambassadors for championing AI and AI initiatives across the organization. Lastly, how can HR decision makers enable the workforce to work confidently with Agentic AI?&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI deployment accelerates despite risks: KPMG | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and Workday are among tech giants that began launching agents last year, promising the next stage of enterprise automation.\n\nBig Four accounting firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have quickly jumped on the band wagon as well, offering their own agentic AI solutions for customers.\n\nAmong the enterprises now using agentic AI, many are taking a balanced, strategic approach, according to the results of the KPMG survey.\n\nNearly half of leaders (46%) said they were focused on efficiency and revenue growth as it relates to their AI agent strategies, according to KPMG’s report. Meanwhile, leader concerns about data privacy, regulatory issues and data quality are at their highest in three quarters, the report said. [...] About one-third of organizations have advanced to full-scale deployment of agentic artificial intelligence technology, up three-fold after two consecutive quarters at 11%, according to a KPMG study released Thursday.\n Fifty-seven percent of surveyed organizations are piloting agents, down from 65%, and 10% are exploring the possibility of using them, compared to 25% last quarter, the Big Four accounting firm found.\n “The data shows just how quickly AI agents are moving out of pilots and into production — and that momentum will only accelerate,” Steve Chase, KPMG’s vice chair of AI and digital innovation, said in a press release. “What makes this moment unique is that leaders increasingly see agents not just as a way to cut costs, but as a way to rethink growth and create new value.” [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nThe still nascent technology continues to pose implementation challenges, KPMG said. The primary obstacles to agent deployment include technical skills gaps, workforce resistance to change and system complexity, according to a report on the findings.\n\nGartner predicts that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Evolution of HR - KPMG agentic corporate services&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The HR transformation has been a long time in the making. In recent years, it has been accelerated by workforce trends (e.g. telecommuting and mobile workforces) and generational challenges. It has also incorporated the rapid advancement of automation, cognitive processing and artificial intelligence (AI). The impact of increasing regulatory burdens along with their security, fraud, and risk implications has also been felt. At the same time, HR is being challenged to attract more informed and sophisticated talent who are, in turn, assessing employers on their social, economic, and corporate values.

All rights reserved.\n12 The Evolution of HR Welcome to the era of “Digital Labour” , where automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are redefining – and in many cases, replacing – jobs across all industries. Although filled with promise, this technological revolution presents many challenges for HR departments, not the least of which is the need to modify workforce strategies, adopt new systems and processes, refresh recruitment and branding strategies, and manage the potential displacement of labour – all while keeping employee and client privacy in mind. [...] Managing digital labour means taking automation to its next natural step and understanding what that means for the company and staff, including for talent strategies, labour relations, and the leadership who will need to lead and manage these new efficiencies with likely less staff. It’s about HR leading the business through this transition, and that’s going to be exciting and challenging.\nManaging digital labour The advance of machine learning means HR professionals must not only manage current implications, but know where the technology is taking the company.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Taming agent sprawl: 3 pillars of AI orchestration - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The velocity of adoption is staggering. Gartner recently predicted that 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by the end of this year. For the average organization, this translates to a fleet of 50+ specialized agents, becoming the new “Shadow IT” if left unmanaged.\n\nFor the modern enterprise, the goal is no longer just deployment; it is orchestration.\n\n## The “agent sprawl” warning: AI’s shadow IT\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before with cloud instances and SaaS apps. Left unchecked, independent agents create a “governance vacuum.” When your marketing agent, supply chain agent, and HR bot all operate in silos, you don’t have an automated workforce; you have a digital riot. [...] Uncoordinated agents lead to “token hemorrhaging”, where redundant API calls and overlapping compute tasks quietly erode ROI. As I noted in “Measuring and scaling AI agent value beyond productivity gains,” the friction between autonomous speed and legacy governance is one of the primary barriers to AI success in 2026.\n\n## The 3 pillars of AI orchestration\n\nTo prevent chaos, your Agentic Operating System (AOS) must be built on three non-negotiable pillars:\n\n### 1. Conflict resolution and priority logic [...] ### 3. Cross-agent security and immutable audits\n\nThe rise of agentic prompt injection is real. A low-clearance agent could inadvertently “trick” a high-privilege agent into leaking sensitive data. Identity is the new perimeter. Every hand-off between agents must be authenticated and logged. A centralized AOS acts as a specialized firewall, providing an immutable audit trail of “who” did “what” and “why.” This is essential for maintaining a fiduciary standard in an autonomous environment.\n\n## Example case study: The $2M logistics loop\n\nConsider a global logistics firm that deployed two autonomous agents in early 2025: one for inventory procurement and one for dynamic warehouse pricing.&quot;,

Left unchecked, independent agents create a “governance vacuum.” When your marketing agent, supply chain agent, and HR bot all operate in silos, you don’t have an automated workforce; you have a digital riot.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;About Capgemini Capgemini is a global business and technology transformation partner, helping organizations to accelerate their dual transition to a digital and sustainable world, while creating tangible impact for enterprises and society. It is a responsible and diverse group of 340,000 team members in more than 50 countries. With its strong over 55-year heritage, Capgemini is trusted by its clients to unlock the value of technology to address the entire breadth of their business needs. It delivers end-to-end services and solutions leveraging strengths from strategy and design to engineering, all fueled by its market leading capabilities in AI, generative AI, cloud and data, combined with its deep industry expertise and partner ecosystem. The Group reported 2024 global revenues of €22.1 [...] “We made sure we were clearly communicating to the business and our technologists why the clean core was important,” he said. “We produce six million batteries per day, so we cannot afford downtime as we upgrade a system.” PECNA uses SAP Business Technology Platform extensively and it has been a game changer for keeping the core clean and automating processes. It also helped to connect the AIP platform to the ERP, so they are harmonized to create a smart factory. Now PECNA is looking at moving into the agentic AI era with its data and AIP platforms. For example, creating co-pilots for HR could add value to the business, or platforms could be augmented with humanoid robots in manufacturing. [...] www.capgemini.com&quot;,

Most importantly, the built-in governance ensures enterprise access is secure and fully managed across all agent ecosystems, so IT leaders can accelerate innovation with confidence.”_\n\nInfosys extends AI Agents with Oracle Integration MCP Tools [...] Secure, Scalable Connectivity: Predictable MCP tools enable Infosys to connect Fusion AI agents with external platforms such as Stripe or Salesforce. Oracle Integration customers can now create predictable MCP tools with a single click from their existing automations, with the unified observability, human oversight, and governance they need to scale their agentic initiatives.\n   Composite Workflows:Infosys uses the low-code Oracle Fusion Agent Studio and OCI Generative AI Agent Hub platforms to create and orchestrate specialized agents. With Oracle Integration MCP tools, these agents can now easily operate across the enterprise, automating complex workflows and reducing manual tasks. [...] Why MCP for Agentic AI and Why Now?\n\nTraditional AI agents often operate in silos, requiring manual workarounds to connect disparate systems and rarely realizing the full promise of automation. The vision of increasingly capable agentic AI ecosystems with lightweight, task-focused agents that leverage trusted tools for predictable enterprise application and data access enables true business transformation. Leading this shift, Infosys leverages a suite of Oracle tools, including Oracle Integration MCP, Fusion Agent Studio, OCI Generative AI, and the AI Data Platform. Together, they break down silos and scale intelligent automation.\n\nAmol Kulkarni, Senior Industry Principal, EA and AI COE Lead at Oracle AI Practice, puts it succinctly:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI Can Power Core Insurance IT Modernization | BCG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI copilots are now embedded throughout the software delivery lifecycle. They facilitate code generation, configuration, and integration activities in both platform-based and customized modernization programs. These AI-powered assistants can refactor and re-engineer legacy applications and automate code development and documentation. Most of the immediate productivity gains accrue to the software vendors and system integrators in the form of faster development and reduced rework. However, insurers can also capture part of these gains when they develop solutions in-house. They also gain indirectly, benefiting from lower project costs, faster delivery, and a higher quality implementation. (See “Revolutionizing Software Development and Code Translation.”) [...] In the design phase, agentic AI helps analyze requirements and map them to the architecture of the newly adopted software, thereby accelerating alignment between business needs and the standard software model. Agentic AI can also help analyze interviews with business and IT specialists (those with deep knowledge of the legacy systems and business rules). It then clusters requirements and simulates target-state options, clarifying the rationale in business logic and design choices. And while it doesn’t eliminate the need for strong human architectural oversight, agentic AI accelerates design iteration and consistency checks, helping to facilitate consensus on early-stage decisions regarding architecture and data structures.\n\nValue: Medium | Maturity: Medium [...] Understanding and documenting the legacy systems\n\nAI agents can analyze legacy applications (such as those based on COBOL), automatically extracting business rules, generating documentation, and creating process maps (including data-flow maps, visual flow diagrams, and nontechnical materials that explain how processes connect system-wide). This capability accelerates one of the toughest, most time-consuming steps in modernization: understanding how legacy systems actually work. AI agents reduce the reliance on subject matter experts whose time is at a premium—and whose numbers are rapidly decreasing due to retirement.\n\nValue: High | Maturity: Medium&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI Redefines Consumer Journeys | BCG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# How AI Agents Are Transforming Consumer Goods. Over the past year, AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have profoundly reshaped the consumer experience, engaging customers through human-like interactions. Yet despite the potential of AI to enhance value creation by as much as 800 basis points, according to BCG research, most companies aren’t making the most of the technology. Agentic AI is a telling example: only 10% of consumer goods and retail companies have successfully integrated AI agents across their teams and workflows. Consumer goods companies that hesitate to adopt AI aren’t just missing an opportunity to reallocate cost savings into brand building and technology investments. AI Agents Reinvent the Consumer Experience. AI Agents Reinvent the Consumer Experience. BCG experts reveal how a leading beauty company is using AI to redefine the consumer journey and deliver personalized, precise, empowering experiences. One leading global beauty brand exemplifies what can be achieved when a company fully embraces AI’s potential. BCG worked with this brand to develop a first-of-its-kind agentic AI that leverages millions of unique data points to deliver a highly personalized consumer experience. Over the next three years, agentic AI will increasingly become a cornerstone of consumer interactions, fundamentally altering how products are discovered and purchased. For consumer goods companies, the message is clear: those without an explicit, AI-first strategic roadmap risk falling significantly behind their competitors. Leading companies aren’t just thinking about consumer-facing AI-enabled executions—they’re looking to reshape end-to-end functions and workflows across each part of the business. Consumer products companies taking full advantage of AI also tend to set aside dedicated funding for AI initiatives, typically allocating around 20% of their organization’s IT budget, with business units given autonomy to own and deploy AI solutions with increased speed and independence.

By embedding agentic AI directly into daily workflows, one global industrial goods company unlocked agility, resilience, and a 2 percentage-point EBITDA boost in just two years. With the ability to observe, plan, and act autonomously, AI agents open a new chapter of end-to-end transformation across industries—streamlining processes, driving data insights, and augmenting human potential like never before.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Click to increase view\n\n Activate to open full-size image in lightbox overlay\n\nThe focus on automation, AI and digital spend shows that the pivot to AI is already underway, with the center of gravity shifting from on-demand content generation to autonomy and orchestration directly serving business goals, or as we call it: agentification of processes.\n\n## What is agentic AI, and why the hype?\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent software that autonomously makes decisions and acts upon it to achieve defined goals without continuous human input. It operates around the clock, learns from its environment, and adapts as conditions change. In HR, its power lies in how it combines three complementary capability levers:\n\n 1 [...] 1\n\n  Transactional automation accelerates repetitive, rule-based tasks to reduce errors and cost\n 2\n\n  Strategic augmentation supports human decisions with real-time insights for better strategy and planning\n 3\n\n  Central orchestration coordinates complex workflows across systems for real-time, end-to-end execution\n\nTraditional generative tools excel at creating content from prompts but remain reactive. Agentic AI builds on these capabilities by adding goal-directed reasoning, persistent memory, and the ability to plan and execute actions within defined guardrails. In practice, this transforms static outputs into dynamic workflows that continuously learn from human feedback. [...] ## What good looks like in practice\n\nLeading HR functions are already piloting focused agentic AI solutions that can be scaled to end-to-end workflows if successful.\n\nThe infographic depicts how Agentic AI supports the sourcing process. HR employees define requirements, review candidate pools, prioritize candidates, and manage communication. AI agents automate profile optimization, data collection and evaluation, shortlist adjustments, and two-way communication, using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), analytical AI, and generative AI. The potential improvement is up to 90% reduction in time-to-hire. \n\nClick to increase view\n\n Activate to open full-size image in lightbox overlay\n\n## Foundations for enablement and the realities of scale&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI in Biopharma: Game-changing Efficiency | BCG&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Agentic AI in Biopharma: Game-changing Efficiency. *Agentic AI is redefining the early stages of drug development by accelerating documentation and boosting productivity.*. By tackling pharma’s most labor- and time-intensive workflows, AI is reshaping the operating model and speeding lifesaving treatments to patients—without sacrificing quality or compliance. ## Transformative AI in Action. One leading pharma company saw an opportunity to cut production times for its medical writing which is critical to the early stages of drug development, yet notorious for its extended timelines. BCG developed a multi-agent AI system for the firm that integrates internal content management platforms and regulatory systems with external scientific databases. This end-to-end writing engine combines generative AI with robust governance, ensuring correct terminology and reference citations, and compliance with regulatory guidelines. AI Agents Cut Timelines in the Biopharma Development Process. This is a modal window. Escape will cancel and close the window. AI Agents Cut Timelines in the Biopharma Development Process. BCG partnered with one global pharmaceutical company to transform medical writing and drastically cut timelines. The implications for agentic AI extend well beyond medical writing. Generative AI is projected to grow faster in health care than any other sector. * Approximately 25% of biopharma companies reported that AI accounted for cost reductions and revenue increases of at least 5%, along with significant improvements in speed and agility. * Pharma companies that create personalized, compliant, adaptable materials for physicians and patients can drive revenue increases of up to 10% while reducing external agency costs by 25%. This is just the tip of the iceberg now that agentic AI is taking hold. By embedding agentic AI directly into daily workflows, one global industrial goods company unlocked agility, resilience, and a 2 percentage-point EBITDA boost in just two years. With only 10% of logistics companies fully embracing generative AI, early adopters are gaining a decisive competitive edge. Agentic AI is redefining consumer journeys—and creating value for companies that embrace its full potential. That’s the promise of AI agents. With the ability to observe, plan, and act autonomously, AI agents open a new chapter of end-to-end transformation across industries—streamlining processes, driving data insights, and augmenting human potential like never before.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Generative AI can make HR more ‘human,’ not less—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The study suggests that selecting the right roles for automation and AI interventions could, on average, save around 15-20% in HR labor time. According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer tool, HR business partners could save up to 15% of employee time through AI; talent acquisition teams can save up to 20%; and HR operations teams up to 35%. [...] “HR is at a critical juncture. The function is under pressure to become both more cost efficient and more strategic. That is a challenging balance to strike,” said John Hazan, a partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of the firm’s Talent solution. “Generative AI has the power to elevate HR’s role in the organization, from transactional operators to strategic advisers. Our analysis suggests a typical company could save, on average, up to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and augmentation.” [...] According to Bain, HR leaders will be able to reinvent their teams’ structure and skills once transactional processes are streamlined through technology. In so doing, specialist HR advisers will become innovation hubs; HR business partners will become advisers to the business and designers of workplace culture; and operational teams will become analysts.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As executives reflect on how agentic AI might shape their business, from competitive positioning to their talent model, they will have to consider how it challenges the fundamentals of their IT architecture. Agentic AI architecture builds on the rise of composable microservices architecture and the use of enterprise cloud services that many companies have already been investing in. But to fully capture the value while navigating the risks, they will need to rethink how AI is embedded across the architecture—the systems, processes, and governance. Enterprises need to ensure agents have the context they need in real time, the ability to observe and explain behavior, and the guardrails to execute safely, securely, and cost-effectively. Current architectures simply cannot handle this balance [...] Companies that don’t want to fall behind should be preparing and investing now: hiring and upskilling teams, embedding new capabilities, and understanding the necessary architectural changes. Those that wait will struggle to catch up. Agentic AI is already reshaping the enterprise, and only those that move decisively—redesigning their architecture, teams, and ways of working—will unlock its full value.\n\nDavid Crawford, chairman of Bain &amp; Company’s Global Technology, Media, and Telecommunications practice; Anne Hoecker, global leader of the TMT practice; and Dana Aulanier, practice vice president of the TMT practice, prepared this report. [...] Reimagine agent experience and access. In this new framework, agents become first-class channels and citizens. As channels, they are emerging as primary interfaces for interacting with customers and employees—on par with websites, mobile apps, and call centers. As citizens, they are fully embedded participants in business operations, empowered to act, make decisions, and collaborate across systems. This demands a reimagining of experience design: Conversational interfaces will dominate human engagement, while agent-to-agent coordination will drive autonomous action across workflows, systems, and even organizational boundaries. To make this work at scale—and safely—enterprises must establish robust frameworks for identity, consent, and fine-grained access control. For example, a South&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI poised to disrupt retail, even with 50% of consumers cautious of fully autonomous purchases—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI, which combines memory, reasoning, and tool use to act semi- or fully autonomously across the shopping journey, is ready to emerge as a retail disrupter. AI now accounts for up to 25% of referral traffic for some retailers, though it is still less than 1% of total traffic, according to Bain’s research in partnership with Similarweb. Of the three types of AI agents – third-party “objective” agents (e.g. ChatGPT, Perplexity), on-site retailer agents, and off-site retailer agents – third-party agents threaten to disintermediate retailers most. Consumers currently trust retailers’ on-site agents three times more, though the trust gap could close as more consumers try utilizing third-party agents. [...] “Agentic AI marks a major shift in retail discovery and loyalty since the rise of search engines,” said Aaron Cheris, partner in Bain’s Retail practice. “These systems are beginning to act independently across the shopping journey, from product research to checkout, creating both disruption and opportunity for retailers. This is the moment to strengthen customer relationships, build trust, and make retailer-value obvious —to humans and to algorithms alike.”\n\nWinning retailers will strategically decide how to participate in the Agentic AI emergence by either building their own agentic capabilities, or by strategically collaborating with major AI platforms, finds Bain. Agility will be crucial as the rules of engagement evolve. [...] NEW YORK—November 13, 2025—Agentic AI is poised to reshape the way consumers shop online, making agentic commerce strategies critical for retailers, Bain &amp; Company finds in a new report Agentic AI in Retail: How Autonomous Shopping Is Redefining the Customer Journey. But while shoppers increasingly use Generative AI, around half still say they are cautious about letting AI agents autonomously handle purchases from start to finish.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## What topics does Bain’s AI Masterclass cover?\n\nEach Bain AI Masterclass spotlights a trending topic in generative AI. This session focused on Agentic AI—systems where multiple “agents” collaborate to solve complex problems. We explored how this approach can accelerate client impact and streamline internal operations.\n\nThe São Paulo event began with a discussion on why Agentic AI matters in the market, exploring how it can make operations more efficient, create opportunities for new products, and reshape core business processes.\n\nThe group moved into a technical discussion before turning to two illustrative business cases based on real client work that showed the concepts in practice: [...] “I have a background in GenAI, especially with LangChain, a popular AI framework, and LangGraph, a newer extension that helps structure workflows, which are flexible but sometimes unstructured. When Bain shared their solution using Crew AI, a framework that structures collaboration among AI agents, I simply fell in love. The catchy point is that Crew AI doesn’t have a solution for human in the loop, so they embedded a LangGraph node inside Crew AI. Mixing two frameworks like that is, for me, a genius action.”\n\nEven if you haven’t worked with these frameworks before, you’ll come away with a clear sense of how Bain applies the latest generative AI in practical and creative ways.\n\n## Why is the Bain AI Masterclass valuable for recruits? [...] A Brazilian tech company using AI to help creators sell digital products like courses and e-books\n A Bain insurance client is using AI to reimagine processes in a traditionally change-resistant industry.\n\nTogether, the sample cases gave participants a sense of how broadly AI can be applied across different contexts.\n\nThe day closed with a live coding demo that spun up an agentic AI setup in real time. This step-by-step build showed how abstract frameworks can quickly become working systems and gave participants a taste of what it looks like moving from strategy to execution within a single session.\n\n## How does Bain use AI frameworks in practice?&quot;,

Now, a fresh discontinuity is at hand. Generative and agentic AI—tools that can reason, decide, and act—are already:\n\nThese aren’t experimental one-offs. The cost curve trajectory of foundation models is accelerating downward even as accuracy improves. OpenAI’s latest frontier reasoning model (o3) dropped 80% in just two months. In three years, any routine, rules-based digital task could move from “human plus app” to “AI agent plus application programming interface (API).”&quot;,
