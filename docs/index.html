This is consistent with global seasonal norms, as the final week of December is typically quiet for major news releases.

Produce a comprehensive JSON object that matches the schema I will give you exactly.

DATE CONTEXT (ET)
- TODAY_ET = 2025-12-26
- LAST_24H_WINDOW_ET = 2025-12-25T06:38 → 2025-12-26T06:38 inclusive

RESEARCH SCOPE
Focus on Workday and its ecosystem — Workday HCM, Workday Extend, Workday Skills Cloud, Workday AI Marketplace, and all agentic or autonomous AI capabilities in SaaS solutions. 
Include:
- Workday product developments, patents, partnerships, and leadership commentary.
- Competitive analysis (SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, etc.).
- GSI &amp; boutique consultancy perspectives (Deloitte, Accenture, EY, KPMG, PwC, IBM, Capgemini, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, Kainos, Invisors, TopBloc, OSV, Alight, Mercer, etc.).
- Ecosystem vendors and hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Salesforce).
- Analyst &amp; media insights (Gartner, Forrester, IDC, Reuters, Bloomberg, VentureBeat, etc.).
- Emerging risks, governance, and responsible AI developments affecting SaaS/HR technology.

WRITING EXPECTATIONS
- For each cited source, provide **multi-paragraph summaries (150–250 words)** that explain:
  - What was announced, found, or claimed.
  - Why it matters strategically, technically, and competitively.
  - Implications for Workday clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice.
- Incorporate synthesis across related articles (e.g., “Across multiple GSIs…” or “Several sources indicate…”).
- Prioritize insights, nuance, and context over mere headlines.
- Every key claim must cite a valid source URL from the provided SOURCE LIST.
- If no credible items are found in the last 24h, produce an honest “no significant updates” section.

FORMATTING RULES
- Return JSON only (no Markdown or prose outside the object).
- `html_body` must be valid, minimal HTML (&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;).
- Section order: Highlights; Competitive Watch; Enablement; Actions for Next Week; Risks &amp; Mitigations; All Sources.
- Keep total HTML under 35 KB.
- `plain_text_body` must be readable text with visible URLs.

Use the following vetted sources to craft the brief.

This temporary news lull is typical due to the year-end holiday period. Organizations can use this pause to reflect on the rapid changes in agentic AI and prepare for anticipated acceleration in Q1 2026. For Deloitte&#x27;s Workday practice, this provides an opportunity to focus on internal enablement, client education, and readiness assessments so teams can move quickly when new developments resume.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;All main competitive vendors (SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, etc.)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;No material market moves, product releases, analyst reactions, or M&amp;A activity reported within the past 24 hours relevant to agentic AI, SaaS HR innovation, or integration partnerships.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;The lack of visible activity provides Workday and its consulting partners like Deloitte a strategic window to strengthen internal alignment and calibrate advisory offerings ahead of what is expected to be an active Q1 2026 cycle in enterprise AI/HR SaaS.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Catch-up: Review 2025’s key launches in Workday AI Agents, Skills Cloud, and developer ecosystem expansion.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte practitioners can summarize the past year’s AI innovations and use cases, positioning themselves as trusted advisors for Workday customers anticipating further 2026 changes.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Schedule internal review of major 2025 AI agentic announcements and map client impact.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Update client-facing collateral with year-in-review content and readiness checklists for anticipated 2026 changes in Workday AI/agent ecosystems.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Monitor ecosystem sources closely for the first signs of Q1 2026 updates or regulatory/regional shifts.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Promote enablement sessions and resources for teams returning from holiday.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Strategic inertia and missed timing as market resumes activity in January 2026.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Use this quiet period for deep enablement, knowledge sharing, and pre-drafting client advisory notes so Deloitte teams are prepared to respond rapidly to any new Workday or competitor moves.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;sources\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Press Releases\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Announces New AI Agent Partner Network and Agent Gateway\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agent-Partner-Network-and-Agent-Gateway-to-Power-the-Next-Generation-of-Human-and-Digital-Workforces\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;html_body\&quot;: \&quot;&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No significant news or material research in the last 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the monitored period (2025-12-25T06:38 to 2025-12-26T06:38 ET), there have been no new announcements, product launches, analyst takes, or competitive shifts directly involving Workday or leading ecosystem players in the AI agentic space. This is consistent with global seasonal norms, as the final week of December is typically quiet for major news releases. Clients and partners are encouraged to leverage this time for strategic planning and internal enablement. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\\\&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All major vendors: No material moves in last 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no substantial communications, press releases, or visible ecosystem movements by SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, or leading GSI/boutique consultancies in the last 24 hours relevant to agentic AI or HR SaaS.
