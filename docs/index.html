<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-Time Employee Benchmarks App Enhances Workday's Data-Driven HR Decisions (Jan 26, 2026)</strong><br/>
    <p>Workday’s Real-Time Employee Benchmarks app, newly featured in the <a href="https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/537021/real-time-employee-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Marketplace</a>, empowers HR leaders and managers to access live market medians and workforce analytics embedded in their Workday HCM experience. By facilitating continuous benchmarking on compensation, skills, and attrition, the app streamlines data-driven workforce decisions and supports evolving agentic HR automation. For Deloitte, this enhances opportunities to lead advanced analytics transformation projects and advisory services, especially those focused on continuous improvement and pay equity analytics.</p>

    <strong>Agentic AI Deployment Tripled in 2025 Despite Ongoing Concerns Over Risk (Jan 26, 2026)</strong><br/>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/agentic-ai-deployment-triples-despite-risks-kpmg/752270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPMG-cited survey</a> shows agentic AI deployment rates more than tripled in the past year. While enthusiasm for autonomy in HR and payroll is high, the lack of comprehensive governance frameworks remains a challenge. This is critical for Deloitte and Workday practitioners aiming to deliver safe and compliant agentic AI workflows; there’s a high-value opportunity to lead with risk mitigation approaches and AI governance expertise during client engagements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Capgemini Expands Strategic Partnership with Google Cloud to Advance Agentic AI Solutions (Jan 27, 2026)</strong><br/>
    <p>Capgemini and Google Cloud announced an expanded joint strategy to develop agentic AI offerings for enterprise CX and operations (<a href="https://www.capgemini.com/ca-en/news/press-releases/capgemini-expands-strategic-partnership-with-google-cloud-to-revolutionize-cx-across-industries-with-agentic-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details here</a>). The partnership accelerates cloud-native agent deployment and advanced integration, directly shaping the competitive landscape for Workday, its AI agent ecosystem, and Deloitte delivery teams. Maintaining differentiation will require cloud-native skills and multi-cloud integration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Capgemini (with Google Cloud)</strong>: Expanded its agentic AI capabilities for enterprise CX, now leveraging Google Cloud’s leading AI models. This increases the sophistication and accessibility of agentic automation across client platforms, underscoring the importance for Deloitte to accelerate similar cloud-agnostic AI integration skills and campaigns. <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/ca-en/news/press-releases/capgemini-expands-strategic-partnership-with-google-cloud-to-revolutionize-cx-across-industries-with-agentic-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>KPMG</strong>: Released findings and frameworks on responsible agentic AI adoption, highlighting governance as a client priority. Deloitte must match or exceed this benchmark by embedding robust risk management in all Workday AI and autonomous solution proposals. <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/agentic-ai-deployment-triples-despite-risks-kpmg/752270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>
  </li>
</ul>

    <em>Outcome (90 days):</em> Deliver analytics-driven HR transformation, drive evidence-based advisory, and elevate client value in workforce planning using live benchmarks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Skill:</strong> Agentic AI Risk and Governance Frameworks <br/>
    <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/agentic-ai-deployment-triples-despite-risks-kpmg/752270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> <br/>
    <em>Outcome (90 days):</em> Facilitate risk/governance workshops and implement AI control frameworks in all Workday AI/agentic client initiatives.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Review and pilot Workday’s Real-Time Employee Benchmarks for key clients; develop client briefing presentations.</li>
  <li>Host internal enablement session on risks and controls in agentic AI (KPMG pulse survey and mitigation practices).</li>
  <li>Assess potential for joint go-to-market strategies with Google Cloud, aiming to differentiate Workday+GCP offerings.</li>
  <li>Analyze competitive pitches from Capgemini and KPMG to refresh Deloitte’s value proposition for Workday-centric agentic AI deployments.</li>
  <li>Draft client-facing risk assessment checklists tailored to agentic AI project launches in HCM and payroll domains.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Weak or delayed governance/control frameworks for agentic AI in Workday environments.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Accelerate Deloitte-developed AI risk frameworks rollout; include risk diagnostics at project initiation.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Competitive encroachment by GSIs with strong hyperscaler alliances (Capgemini-GCP).<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Strengthen multi-cloud skills; position Deloitte as the cloud-agnostic agentic AI integrator of choice.
  </li>
</ul>

Daily updates emphasize recent deployments, benchmarking innovations, and ongoing competitive responses by major cloud and SaaS rivals.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Real-Time Employee Benchmarks App Enhances Workday&#x27;s Data-Driven HR Decisions (Published: Jan 26, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s Real-Time Employee Benchmarks application, featured on the Workday Marketplace, introduces granular people analytics with market-oriented benchmarking directly into the Workday HCM user experience. This innovation allows HR leaders and line managers to compare their workforce data—such as compensation, attrition, and skills—against live market medians and quartiles, streamlining data-driven decision-making. The app’s real-time updates reduce the latency previously seen in traditional, survey-led benchmarking processes, which is strategically important as enterprises demand more agile workforce planning and competitive insights in the era of agentic AI.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this development strengthens advisory and managed services offerings tied to advanced analytics and continuous change management. It opens opportunities for Deloitte to partner with clients on enterprise data readiness and benchmarking enablement, as well as to integrate benchmarking insights into workforce transformation, pay equity analyses, and AI-powered talent optimization services. The increased focus on real-time HR benchmarking can position Workday-centric service providers as preferred partners for evidence-based HR strategies, provided they effectively operationalize the new analytics suite.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://marketplace.workday.com/apps/537021/real-time-employee-benchmarks\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI Deployment Tripled in 2025 Despite Ongoing Concerns Over Risk (Published: Jan 26, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;According to a new survey covered by HR Dive, the rate of agentic AI deployment has tripled year-on-year, despite lingering concerns over governance, workforce risk, and explainability. KPMG and multiple analyst groups emphasize that organizations are pushing ahead with autonomous HR and business systems, with use-cases concentrated in recruitment, onboarding, payroll automation, and employee self-service. While enthusiasm is high, the survey reveals a significant gap: only a minority of organizations have established robust risk frameworks and control mechanisms for these autonomous agents—exposing them to compliance, reputational, and operational risks.\\n\\nStrategically, for the Workday and Deloitte ecosystem, this signals both opportunity and risk. As agentic AI becomes mainstream, demand grows for implementation partners who can help clients balance innovation with trusted governance. Deloitte’s Workday practice can differentiate by offering not only technical deployments but also frameworks for AI risk assessment, scenario testing, and continuous ethical monitoring. Proactive education and joint risk-mitigation toolkits will be essential to sustaining trust with Workday clients.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.hrdive.com/news/agentic-ai-deployment-triples-despite-risks-kpmg/752270\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini Expands Strategic Partnership with Google Cloud to Advance Agentic AI Solutions (Published: Jan 27, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini and Google Cloud have announced a significant expansion of their collaboration to build and deliver agentic AI solutions across sectors, with a focus on customer experience (CX) transformation and digital operations. The joint offering leverages Google’s AI capabilities and Capgemini’s domain consulting expertise, combining pre-built AI agents with enterprise integration frameworks. This move places direct competitive pressure on both Workday’s emerging agentic/AI marketplace and its consulting partners, as hyperscaler-powered SaaS ecosystems now converge on agent-driven automation and intelligent workflow orchestration.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday teams, this deepened alliance highlights the pressing need for cloud-native integration skills and Google Cloud partnership capabilities, especially as clients begin to expect cross-platform agent leverage (Workday, Google, Salesforce, and ServiceNow converging). Deloitte must double down on cloud-agnostic agentic architectures and deepen playbooks for AI-powered, multi-cloud client environments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.capgemini.com/ca-en/news/press-releases/capgemini-expands-strategic-partnership-with-google-cloud-to-revolutionize-cx-across-industries-with-agentic-ai\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini (with Google Cloud)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced the expansion of agentic AI-driven CX and digital operations offerings, harnessing Google Cloud&#x27;s AI stack and Capgemini&#x27;s domain consulting.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Heightens competition for cloud-based agentic automation platforms in HR and enterprise service domains.
