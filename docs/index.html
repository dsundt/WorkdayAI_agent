<ul>
<li><strong>No significant updates in Workday agentic AI or enterprise SaaS ecosystem (Nov 23–24, 2025)</strong><br />
A thorough review of authorized sources reveals no major product releases, strategic partnerships, patents, high-impact leadership commentary, or major analyst briefings related to Workday, its agentic AI/AI marketplace, major SaaS competitors, GSIs, or ecosystem partners during the specified 24-hour research window (2025-11-23T06:38 to 2025-11-24T06:38). This period of stability offers an opportunity for Deloitte’s Workday practice to reflect on prior developments and maintain readiness for upcoming news cycles, while current strategies and enablement efforts remain unchanged. It is advisable to remain alert for signals of activity later in the week as the pace of AI, agentic automation, and SaaS transformation is likely to increase leading into year-end and Q1 cycles.<br />

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li>No notable competitive moves were reported in the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li>No new enablement resources or skills have been published in the research window.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor Workday newsroom and official AI partner announcements for material news.</li>
<li>Continue internal enablement for agentic AI concepts, especially for client advisory roles.</li>
<li>Prepare rapid response materials in anticipation of potential year-end strategy updates from competitors, hyperscalers, or GSIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Complacency due to lack of headline news could result in missed signals when activity resumes.<br />
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Maintain watchfulness and ensure that advisory teams are ready to brief clients as soon as relevant updates appear.</li>
</ul>

  - Implications for Workday clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice.
- Incorporate synthesis across related articles (e.g., “Across multiple GSIs…” or “Several sources indicate…”).
- Prioritize insights, nuance, and context over mere headlines.
- Every key claim must cite a valid source URL from the provided SOURCE LIST.
