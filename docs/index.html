<ul>
  <li><strong>ADP Named One of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies for 20th Year (Published: 2026-01-21)</strong><br />
    <p>ADP’s recent accolade not only signals enduring customer trust but intensifies the brand credibility challenge for Workday and next-gen platforms. This milestone is strategically important as it sets buyer expectations for reliability and stewardship in the era of AI-driven workforce solutions. Deloitte’s Workday teams must counteract entrenched brand loyalty with proof points on reliability, innovation, and responsible AI, ensuring Workday’s value proposition breaks through legacy perceptions. <a href="https://mediacenter.adp.com/2026-01-21-ADP-Named-One-of-Fortunes-Most-Admired-Companies-TM-for-20th-Straight-Year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mercer’s 2024/2025 Skills Snapshot Highlights Acceleration of Skills-Based Talent Management (Published: 2026-01-21)</strong><br />
    <p>Mercer’s new survey points to the mainstreaming of agile, AI-enabled skills-based frameworks as organizations abandon traditional job architectures. For Workday, the implications are material: client expectations are trending toward robust, integrated skills management underpinned by cloud and AI. Deloitte should reference these findings as a catalyst to drive client adoption of Workday Skills Cloud, highlighting the consulting value of future-focused talent strategies. <a href="https://www.mercer.com/insights/talent-and-transformation/skill-based-talent-management/rebuilding-reward-and-career-frameworks-based-on-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full survey</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ADP</strong>: Recognized for the 20th year by Fortune as a ‘Most Admired Company.’<br />
    <p>This reinforces ADP’s trust-based positioning in HR technology and complicates competitive conversations, especially with risk-sensitive buyers. Deloitte must help Workday counter this narrative with proof of reliability and AI-driven progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mercer</strong>: New report drives urgency for skills-based talent transformation.<br />
    <p>Mercer’s research validates rapidly shifting buyer demand for enterprise-grade AI skills clouds. Implementation partners like Deloitte are positioned to guide clients through this evolution, leveraging Workday’s platform strengths.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday Skills Cloud Strategy &amp; Implementation</strong>: <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skills Cloud Overview</a><br />
    Equip clients to launch Workday Skills Cloud for more adaptive workforce models in line with current market trends.
  </li>

    Ensure teams understand and communicate Workday’s commitment to responsible AI, supporting client risk management and compliance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audit current client roadmaps to position Workday’s reliability and AI credentials against incumbent brands like ADP.</li>
  <li>Host Mercer Skills Survey briefings to inform client and internal advisory approaches.</li>
  <li>Refresh Deloitte consultant enablement around skills-based transformation and cross-functional value of AI-driven talent strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Trusted competitor brands slow Workday adoption.<br />
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Amplify Workday client stories on reliability and innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Clients underutilize Workday Skills Cloud due to change fatigue.<br />
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Run targeted transformation workshops informed by latest research.</li>

The immediate focus for Workday clients and Deloitte should be to evaluate the evolving landscape of skills clouds, brand strength, and AI governance that is shaping buyer preferences and deployment strategies.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;ADP Named One of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies for 20th Year (Published: 2026-01-21)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;ADP’s recognition as one of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies for the twentieth consecutive year is more than a symbolic accolade; it underscores ADP’s sustained brand equity and perceived trust in the HRTech market. Such industry accolades carry strategic significance, as they reinforce ADP’s credibility among enterprise buyers at a time when trust is paramount in vendor selection for AI-driven platforms and workforce technologies. \\n\\nFor Workday and its ecosystem, this ongoing recognition highlights the challenge of differentiating in a segment where legacy players maintain considerable mindshare. ADP’s prominence as a ‘most admired’ corporation serves as a reference point when prospective clients—especially in conservative or highly regulated sectors—compare vendor reliability, reputation, and trustworthiness. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this signals the need to supplement technical advantages with clearer messaging on Workday’s reliability, innovation, and proven impact to counteract the bias of entrenched rivals. \\n\\nStrategically, this brand milestone by ADP comes as enterprises weigh long-term risk in platform adoption—particularly where AI and agentic capabilities are new and require responsible stewardship. Deloitte advisors should leverage Workday’s proven performance stories and responsible AI track record to promote differentiation in client engagements.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://mediacenter.adp.com/2026-01-21-ADP-Named-One-of-Fortunes-Most-Admired-Companies-TM-for-20th-Straight-Year\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Mercer’s 2024/2025 Skills Snapshot Highlights Acceleration of Skills-Based Talent Management (Published: 2026-01-21)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Mercer’s recently released Skills Snapshot Survey underscores a growing enterprise consensus: a shift away from rigid job architectures toward agile, AI-enabled skills-based frameworks. The report, based on a global cross-section of HR leaders, finds organizations urgently rebuilding reward and career frameworks around skills rather than roles, emphasizing dynamic talent pools and upskilling powered by platforms like Workday Skills Cloud.\\n\\nTechnically, the survey validates the continued integration of AI in skills inference and the burgeoning need for robust, federated skills ontologies. It also points to a greater expectation placed on vendors like Workday to deliver seamless, interoperable skills data across functions. For Deloitte, these results should inform consultative approaches, recommending Workday Skills Cloud adoption and helping clients evolve workforce strategy in a way that leverages structured and inferred skills. Crucially, it also opens partnership opportunities across HR advisory and adoption services.\\n\\nCompetitively, the findings reinforce how market education around AI-powered skills management is now mainstream, requiring all ecosystem players—including GSIs—to deliver differentiated value around rapid skills mapping, personalized learning, and measurable business outcomes.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.mercer.com/insights/talent-and-transformation/skill-based-talent-management/rebuilding-reward-and-career-frameworks-based-on-skills\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ADP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Received 20th consecutive Fortune ‘Most Admired Company’ recognition, reaffirming market trust and brand leadership.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Workday faces entrenched brand loyalty barriers in enterprise buyers’ minds, especially among risk-averse industries.
