<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday to acquire Pipedream to extend AI agent integrations across enterprise apps</strong> (Published 2025-11-19)<br>
    <p>Workday’s acquisition of <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/19/workday-acquire-pipedream-extend-ai-agent-integrations-across-enterprise-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pipedream</a> marks a strategic leap in how Workday will empower customers to orchestrate agentic AI workflows across both Workday and external SaaS applications. By offering low-code, prebuilt connectors for automation, Pipedream bridges a key gap in Workday’s ecosystem often highlighted by clients and implementation partners. This integration-layer expansion is poised to reduce the friction of implementing enterprise-wide AI agents, supporting cross-application data access, orchestration, and automation in heterogeneous environments. Deloitte delivery and advisory teams need to rapidly skill up on securing, governing, and scaling such integrations, while clients can expect accelerated deployment timelines and new agentic use cases with less reliance on custom development or middleware.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>:<br>
    <p>ServiceNow’s steady rollout of <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/community/hrsd-blog/agentic-ai-capabilities-for-hr/ba-p/3288346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agentic AI HR capabilities</a>—including autonomous employee-facing agents and HR Service Delivery extensions—signals intensifying competition in the employee experience and workflow automation markets. ServiceNow’s platform-centric agent architecture competes with Workday’s strategy, especially as both vendors race to offer prebuilt and extensible AI agent workflows. For Workday and Deloitte, the implication is a renewed mandate to lead with technical differentiation, extensibility, and robust governance, particularly as enterprise buyers now expect seamless, multi-SaaS agent orchestration. The Pipedream acquisition strengthens Workday’s position if execution is swift and governed.</p>

      <i>In 90 days, teams should achieve the ability to rapidly architect, implement, and govern agentic workflows spanning Workday and third-party SaaS, improving speed and reliability in real client deployments.</i></li>
  <li><b>HR Agentic AI Use Cases: ServiceNow vs. Workday</b> – <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/community/hrsd-blog/agentic-ai-capabilities-for-hr/ba-p/3288346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a><br>
      <i>Teams will clearly differentiate and articulate competitive strengths, elevating client engagement quality and RFP hit rates.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Review integration and security playbooks in anticipation of post-acquisition connector expansion.</li>
  <li>Update sales and technical assets for Pipedream’s impact on cross-app agent orchestration.</li>
  <li>Host knowledge-share on Workday vs. ServiceNow HR agent solutions and implementation.</li>
  <li>Start client workshops to define and roadmap priority agent-driven automations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Integration governance gaps for agentic workflows</b><br>Mitigation: Implement and enforce new AI integration governance covering external connectors, traceability, and third-party vendor review.</li>
  <li><b>Customer confusion over HR agent overlaps</b><br>Mitigation: Develop and communicate clear reference architectures and comparison guides for field teams and clients.</li>

This move, coupled with continued competitive activity from Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow, requires Workday clients and Deloitte teams to closely monitor integration, governance, and deployment best practices in the AI agent space.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday to acquire Pipedream to extend AI agent integrations across enterprise apps (Published 2025-11-19)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday has announced the imminent acquisition of Pipedream, a popular low-code integration platform, signaling a significant expansion of Workday’s capabilities to connect its AI agents and autonomous workflows with a broader suite of third-party enterprise applications. According to the announcement, Pipedream’s technology will enable Workday customers to automate multi-app workflows with little to no code, natively supporting AI-driven business processes and helping clients orchestrate agentic AI experiences across both Workday and external SaaS environments.\\n\\nStrategically, this acquisition positions Workday to compete directly with hyperscaler-agnostic integration capabilities seen in platforms like Salesforce MuleSoft and Boomi, and it will help close a key gap cited by customers needing out-of-the-box connectors for AI-enabled process automation. For technical teams and Deloitte’s Workday practice, this deal highlights a critical trend: the integration layer is now central to successful enterprise AI agent adoption. Seamless connectivity ensures that agentic workflows aren’t siloed and can access the relevant data and trigger actions beyond core Workday modules.\\n\\nFor clients, the acquisition promises faster time-to-value in deploying agent-supported use cases—reducing the friction traditionally associated with cross-app automation. For Deloitte, it is vital to rapidly upskill delivery teams on the new integration paradigms and extend governance, security, and interoperability frameworks to cover these expanded agent touchpoints. This M&amp;A activity also compels partners to re-evaluate their own extensibility roadmaps and ensure robust, future-proof architectures. \\n\\nSource: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/19/workday-acquire-pipedream-extend-ai-agent-integrations-across-enterprise-apps\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/19/workday-acquire-pipedream-extend-ai-agent-integrations-across-enterprise-apps\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow has continued push on agentic AI capabilities for HR and HR Service Delivery, emphasizing autonomous employee-facing agents and workflow extensibility announced within the last several days.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow’s visible advancement in agentic HR solutions compounds the competitive threat to Workday, as both platforms race to offer prebuilt and extensible AI agents for employee self-service and operations. For Deloitte and Workday ecosystems, it is critical to articulate points of technical differentiation (e.g., data model, skill mapping, compliance workflows) and rapidly enable clients to leverage Workday&#x27;s integration and AI governance strengths in order to maintain market leadership. Moreover, middleware partnerships or native integration points—such as those enabled by Workday’s Pipedream acquisition—could become highly strategic over the next two quarters, as enterprise buyers evaluate which ecosystem provides the fastest end-to-end agentic workflow deployment.\\n\\nSource: https://www.servicenow.com/community/hrsd-blog/agentic-ai-capabilities-for-hr/ba-p/3288346\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;AI Agent Integration Best Practices for Workday and Multi-SaaS Ecosystems\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/19/workday-acquire-pipedream-extend-ai-agent-integrations-across-enterprise-apps\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte delivery teams can rapidly architect, implement, and govern agentic workflows that span both Workday and external SaaS applications, reducing rollout time and improving solution reliability for clients.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;HR Agentic AI Use Cases: ServiceNow vs. Workday\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.servicenow.com/community/hrsd-blog/agentic-ai-capabilities-for-hr/ba-p/3288346\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Practitioners will be able to clearly differentiate and communicate the unique strengths of Workday&#x27;s AI agent stack, leading to improved client confidence and competitive win rates in RFP situations.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Review integration touchpoints and security best practices in anticipation of Pipedream-Workday connector expansion.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Update Playbooks and sales enablement content to include Pipedream’s role in Workday AI agent orchestration.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Organize live knowledge-share sessions comparing Workday and ServiceNow HR agent capabilities with focus on implementation patterns.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Engage with client CIO and HRIT teams to identify top-priority cross-app agentic automation use cases.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Integration security and governance gaps as agentic workflows span SaaS and external platforms.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Implement robust governance frameworks that include third-party integration monitoring, secure connectors, and AI agent action traceability, leveraging best practices from both Workday and standard market controls.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Customer confusion over overlapping agent features across Workday and major competitors.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Clearly articulate use-case-led differentiators and produce reference architectures that show value from Workday&#x27;s newly enhanced agent ecosystem.
