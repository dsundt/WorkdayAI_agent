  <li><b>AWS introduces new agentic AI services and launches Security Agent (Published 2025-12-02)</b><br />
    On <b>2025-12-02</b>, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/aws-rolls-security-agent-strengthens-guardduty-security-hub-reinvent-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS</a> unveiled a host of agentic AI solutions, including the AWS Security Agent for real-time threat detection, Nova Act for browser-based automations, and expanded Nova model capabilities. Proactive agent security and multi-agent orchestration are now central to AWS's enterprise offering, moving from classic IaaS to trusted agentic service delivery. For Deloitte and Workday clients, leveraging these AWS advances can drive more scale and more robust compliance, but also raises client expectations for comparable features from Workday itself.<br />

  <li><b>AWS CEO Matt Garman declares a new era of agentic infrastructure (Published 2025-12-02)</b><br />
    In a high-visibility interview, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/exclusive-aws-ceo-matt-garman-declares-new-era-agents-new-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CEO Matt Garman</a> confirmed agentic and reasoning-first AI as AWS’s new cloud backbone, emphasizing the need for scalable, secure, and orchestratable agent platforms that work with SaaS, ISV, and custom business applications. This direction mandates that Workday and its partners, like Deloitte, stay ahead of cross-platform agent orchestration and governance trends.<br />

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>AWS</b>: Launched new Security Agent, Nova Act, and agent orchestration platforms. <br /><i>Implication</i>: Raises bar for agentic extensibility, orchestration, and security—forcing Workday and its partners to address similar client requirements or risk losing influence to AWS-driven automation and extensions.</li>
  <li><b>ServiceNow</b>: Acquired Veza for integrated agent-centric identity security. <br /><i>Implication</i>: Solidifies ServiceNow's leadership in secure workflow automation, and may set new governance standards for agent-enabled SaaS ecosystems. Pressures Workday to offer equivalent agent identity and access management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Skill: <b>Understanding Agentic Infrastructure in SaaS and Cloud Ecosystems</b><br />
    Resource: <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/agentic-infrastructure-thecube-keynote-analysis-awsreinvent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/agentic-infrastructure-thecube-keynote-analysis-awsreinvent</a><br />
    Outcome: Consultants become fluent in agent-based business architecture and cross-domain orchestration.
  </li>
  <li>Skill: <b>Agent Security Best Practices</b><br />
    Resource: <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/aws-rolls-security-agent-strengthens-guardduty-security-hub-reinvent-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/aws-rolls-security-agent-strengthens-guardduty-security-hub-reinvent-2025</a><br />
    Outcome: Design and deploy secure, audit-ready, multi-agent automation for clients.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Map AWS Security Agent and Nova Act adoption opportunities for current Workday clients.</li>
  <li>Develop reference architectures for secure, end-to-end agent orchestration using AWS, Workday, and ServiceNow components.</li>
  <li>Update Deloitte’s internal knowledge base with latest agentic AI requirements and security guidelines.</li>
  <li>Monitor Workday ecosystem channels for emerging responses or feature launches in the agent security domain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Risk</b>: Hyperscaler agentic features may outcompete Workday’s native capabilities.<br /><i>Mitigation</i>: Position Deloitte as the ‘orchestration integrator’ to maximize upside for clients and Workday, leveraging strengths across both environments.</li>
  <li><b>Risk</b>: Gaps in agent security, auditability.<br /><i>Mitigation</i>: Ensure rigorous solutioning with layered identity and monitoring controls built into all agent-enabled deployments.</li>

No Workday ecosystem announcements were evident in the last 24 hours, but trends in autonomous agent management, security, and identity signal important competitive directions Deloitte’s Workday practice should monitor.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AWS introduces new agentic AI services and launches Security Agent (Published 2025-12-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On 2025-12-02, AWS made several strategic announcements at its re:Invent event, rolling out a suite of new agentic AI tools and platforms, including the AWS Security Agent, Nova Act for browser-based workflows, and expanded Nova foundation models. The AWS Security Agent is positioned as a proactive AI service enhancing enterprise security by monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats in real-time. Notably, AWS highlighted the ability to bring sovereign AI ‘on-premises’ with new AI Factories for regulated and global enterprise customers. These moves underscore AWS’s pivot from pure infrastructure to providing comprehensive agentic computing solutions for the enterprise, with a focus on high assurance, extensible controls, and developer enablement.\\n\\nStrategically, AWS’s emphasis on agentic infrastructure and quality evaluation frameworks addresses both the massive scaling challenge and the trust deficit often faced by autonomous AI agents in business-critical environments. Their platform approach—enabling centralized management of agents and fine-grained security controls—raises industry benchmarks for reliability and governance. From a Workday ecosystem perspective, AWS’s arms race in agentic AI delivers both direct competition and partnership opportunities: Workday’s reliance on AWS for cloud infrastructure means that policy, security, and agent orchestration innovations by AWS could be leveraged or, conversely, become sources of client comparison.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the growing sophistication of hyperscaler AI offerings will be top-of-mind for clients seeking agent-based automation within secure, compliant environments. Deloitte must be prepared to bridge Workday’s SaaS capabilities with emerging AWS agentic platforms for joint solutioning and position itself as a trusted, neutral advisor as clients navigate a proliferating set of agentic AI tools.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/aws-rolls-security-agent-strengthens-guardduty-security-hub-reinvent-2025\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow acquires Veza, expanding its identity security portfolio to support agentic AI access controls (Published 2025-12-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow’s announcement on 2025-12-02 to acquire Veza, an identity security platform, marks a significant step in strengthening its agentic and automated service delivery models. Veza’s capabilities provide fine-grained access visibility and policy management, enabling more robust controls as enterprise workflows become increasingly agent-driven and autonomous. As agentic AI tools proliferate, identity-centric security becomes essential—not just for user access but for AI agent-to-agent and agent-to-system interactions.\\n\\nTechnically, this acquisition aligns with the broader industry shift to platformized and automated cybersecurity, where agents autonomously manage tasks and access permissions based on contextual rules and risk signals. ServiceNow can now offer deeper and more flexible governance over AI-initiated processes, enhancing visibility, user trust, and regulatory compliance.\\n\\nThe implication for Workday clients is that ServiceNow’s move may reset customer expectations around agentic AI security, particularly in regulated industries. Deloitte’s Workday teams collaborating with ServiceNow or its customers need to be prepared for rising demand for integrated agent identity management, auditability, and joint automation workflows spanning HCM, ITSM, and SecOps.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/servicenow-acquire-veza-move-expand-identity-security-portfolio\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AWS CEO Matt Garman signals a new era: Agentic infrastructure and reasoning-first services become cloud priorities (Published 2025-12-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;In a high-visibility interview published 2025-12-02, AWS CEO Matt Garman outlined a profound strategic pivot, calling the mainstreaming of agentic and reasoning-first AI services the foundation of AWS’s next era. Garman described how AWS customers—from enterprises to ISVs—are increasingly designing platforms where autonomous agents handle end-to-end workflows, drive software development, and enforce security in highly distributed multi-cloud environments. AWS’s rollouts—including the Security Agent, Nova Act, and AI Factories—reflect this direction, supporting both developer and business-centric uses of agentic AI.\\n\\nFor Workday and its ecosystem, this signals a new bar for agent orchestration, transparency, and platform extensibility expected by enterprise buyers—particularly those leaning into next-gen HR, finance, or operational automation. Cloud infrastructure partners such as AWS are no longer providing just IaaS or PaaS but will compete to own the orchestration and trusted governance layer for autonomous agent networks. This shift poses opportunities and risks: Workday’s differentiated value-add in curated HR/Finance agent use cases must keep pace, or face marginalization if agentic orchestration is abstracted to the hyperscaler.\\n\\nDeloitte teams supporting Workday implementations will need to anticipate growing client requests for cross-platform agentic orchestration, security integration, and the alignment of HR system agent roles with broader multi-agent, multi-cloud business architectures. Deep awareness of AWS’s evolving feature sets will be vital for solutioning and downstream support.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/02/exclusive-aws-ceo-matt-garman-declares-new-era-agents-new-cloud\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;AWS\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched proactive Security Agent, Nova Act for browser workflows, and expanded frontier agent and model orchestration.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;AWS’s innovations accelerate enterprise adoption of agentic automation, setting a pace and bar that SaaS providers (including Workday) must meet.
