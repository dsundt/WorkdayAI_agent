<li><strong>Cognizant Unveils Artificial Intelligence Lab and Moment™ Studio in Bengaluru (Published 2025-12-11):</strong>
<p>Cognizant announced its new Artificial Intelligence Lab and Moment™ Studio in Bengaluru, India, aimed at rapid client adoption of advanced AI, including agentic and autonomous AI. The lab is positioned as a major regional innovation hub for prototyping, responsible AI co-creation, and quick scaling of enterprise solutions, echoing priorities observed in platform vendors like Workday. This development spotlights Cognizant’s escalation as a key integrator and innovator in the enterprise AI space, potentially shifting expectations and deal landscapes for Workday and its partners. <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2025-12-11-Cognizant-Unveils-Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-and-Cognizant-Moment-TM-Studio-in-Bengaluru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p></li>
<li><strong>Harness Raises $240M to Advance Automated AI Agents After-Code Gap (Published 2025-12-11):</strong>
<p>Automation platform Harness completed a $240 million raise (valued at $5.5 billion) to expand its agentic AI and orchestration offerings for enterprise customers. Harness’s strategy to target the automation ‘after-code’ gap highlights growing capital and technical focus on the orchestration side of AI-driven enterprise platforms—a terrain adjacent to Workday’s agentic AI moves. This suggests competition for the same enterprise dollars, especially where seamless post-development AI integration is priority. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/harness-hits-5-5b-valuation-with-240m-to-automate-ais-after-code-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full article</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognizant:</strong> Opening of an AI Lab and Studio in India reinforces Cognizant’s market position as a primary destination for digital and agentic AI projects. <br/> <em>Implication:</em> Raises the bar for global GSIs on delivery speed, regional AI expertise, and co-innovation for Workday-centric clients. Deloitte teams will need to further differentiate on responsible AI and business transformation chops.</li>
<li><strong>Harness:</strong> High-profile capital raise signals the scaling of automated AI agents orchestrating complex business processes—directly adjacent to goals of Workday's agentic AI. <br/> <em>Implication:</em> Increased multi-vendor orchestration demands in enterprise SaaS will require Deloitte’s Workday teams to guide clients on integration risks and value realization strategies across platforms.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor Workday, Cognizant, and Harness channels for new reference architectures and client impact stories in agentic AI.</li>
<li>Brief key client and pursuit teams about Cognizant’s Bengaluru AI Lab and its implications for service delivery competition in APAC.</li>
<li>Iterate internal enablement modules for Workday AI consulting to incorporate agentic deployment patterns and competitive nuance.</li>
<li>Evaluate Harness-Workday integration scenarios for risk and opportunity identification in multi-cloud AI agent deployments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> GSI-led agentic AI proliferation eroding Deloitte’s differentiation in Workday projects. <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Accelerate agentic AI upskilling and actively market Deloitte’s co-innovation wins, especially on responsible AI frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Ecosystem and automation vendors shifting client demands toward open, interoperable AI agent orchestration, exceeding Workday native extensibility. <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Lead early with integration and governance strategy, positioning Deloitte as integration advisor regardless of toolset choices.</li>
</ul>

The initiative seeks to accelerate client adoption of next-generation AI, including agentic and autonomous AI solutions for enterprise applications. The lab will serve as a hub for collaborative prototyping, co-innovation, and rapid scaling of AI-powered business solutions. The facility notably prioritizes responsible AI and ethical frameworks embedded in product design, aligning with trends seen in Workday and other leading SaaS platforms. This move enhances Cognizant&#x27;s role as a key ecosystem integrator for multi-vendor AI stacks, including Workday deployment use cases where GSIs are increasingly tasked with integrating and customizing AI-driven workflows. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, Cognizant’s investment signals downstream competition in AI implementation services, particularly for clients seeking digital transformation that leverages both platform-native and cross-platform agentic AI. The presence of a dedicated enterprise AI lab in a major delivery center geography could also intensify the pace of proof-of-concept and go-live activity in the region, raising client expectations for speed and innovation cycles. Deloitte teams should closely monitor how partnership and technology deployment models evolve between Workday, Cognizant, and their mutual clients to maintain differentiation in delivery and co-innovation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2025-12-11-Cognizant-Unveils-Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-and-Cognizant-Moment-TM-Studio-in-Bengaluru\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Harness Raises $240M to Advance Automated AI Agents After-Code Gap (Published 2025-12-11)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Harness, a fast-growing automation platform, announced a $240 million funding round at a $5.5 billion valuation to accelerate the delivery of automated AI solutions, including post-development agentic capabilities. While not an HCM provider itself, Harness targets enterprise automation by bridging the &#x27;after-code gap&#x27;—the disconnect between AI model development and reliable, scalable, real-world business operations. The investment’s significance lies in how adjacent SaaS and automation vendors are raising large capital to attack the automation orchestration and agent deployment space that Workday is advancing with Illuminate and the Agent Gateway. As organizations look for AI agents that operate safely at scale (including integration with HCM, payroll, and analytics), Harness’s go-to-market and technology evolution could offer both cautionary signals and partnership opportunity for Workday and its service network. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the scale of Harness’s raise underscores client demand for robust, agentic automations that work across legacy and cloud applications, signaling potential pressure on incumbent platform players—including Workday—to deepen extensibility, open connector models, and tight operational control in next-gen AI agent frameworks.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/harness-hits-5-5b-valuation-with-240m-to-automate-ais-after-code-gap\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Opened a new AI Lab and Moment™ Studio in Bengaluru to expedite AI and agentic capability development for enterprise clients, amplifying its ecosystem delivery portfolio.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant is positioning itself as a premium integrator for digital and agentic AI services, often overlapping with Workday clients managed by Deloitte and other GSIs. This increases competition for AI-led transformation, as clients will compare the flexibility and speed of Cognizant’s AI-driven service delivery against Deloitte&#x27;s bespoke and platform-focused approach.

Implication: More intense GSI competition for Workday-centric AI transformation services, especially in APAC and global delivery centers.\\n- Harness: Major funding round to accelerate agent orchestration delivery. Implication: Increased client demand for agentic AI that integrates across platforms, potentially raising expectations for Workday, Deloitte, and other partners.\\n\\nEnablement\\n- Understanding Agentic AI and its Application in Enterprise SaaS: https://www.workday.com/en-us/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html (Outcome: Teams articulate and design agentic AI integration best practices.)\\n- Responsible AI Governance for SaaS and Multi-Agent Environments: https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html (Outcome: Teams lead AI governance conversations confidently.)\\n- AI-driven Business Transformation &amp; Multi-Platform Agent Deployment: https://news.cognizant.com/2025-12-11-Cognizant-Unveils-Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-and-Cognizant-Moment-TM-Studio-in-Bengaluru (Outcome: Teams compare and update on latest GSI agentic deployment approaches.)\\n\\nActions for Next Week\\n- Monitor Workday, Cognizant, and Harness channels for reference stories and client impact use cases in agentic AI.\\n- Update APAC and global teams on Cognizant’s AI Lab and competitive delivery implications.\\n- Refresh internal enablement for Workday AI consulting with current agentic AI deployment models.\\n- Analyze Harness/Workday integration scenarios for opportunity and risk.\\n\\nRisks &amp; Mitigations\\n- Risk: Rising GSI agentic AI capacity lessens Deloitte’s differentiation in Workday projects. Mitigation: Accelerate agentic AI upskilling and showcase responsible AI case studies.\\n- Risk: Automation vendors push demand for open/interoperable agent orchestration beyond Workday’s current extensibility. Mitigation: Advise clients proactively on integration controls and position Deloitte as the “integration architect” partner.\\n\\nAll Sources\\n- Cognizant Unveils Artificial Intelligence Lab and Cognizant Moment™ Studio in Bengaluru: https://news.cognizant.com/2025-12-11-Cognizant-Unveils-Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-and-Cognizant-Moment-TM-Studio-in-Bengaluru\\n- Harness hits $5.5B valuation with $240M raise to automate AI’s after-code gap: https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/harness-hits-5-5b-valuation-with-240m-to-automate-ais-after-code-gap\\n- What Is Agentic AI?
