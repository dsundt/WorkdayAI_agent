<ul>
  <li><b>MIND launches Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Agentic AI to Secure Data Used by Autonomous Systems (2026-01-28)</b><br/>
    <p>MIND has announced a new DLP solution focused on agentic AI. As agentic AI is deployed in mission-critical, sensitive functions like HR and payroll, risks around data privacy and governance grow. The DLP platform embeds monitoring and enterprise-grade controls designed for autonomous systems, which is increasingly relevant for Workday and other SaaS HR platforms. This launch directly addresses security and compliance demands from highly regulated clients, making it crucial for Deloitte’s Workday advisors to incorporate such DLP capabilities into transformation conversations. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/mind-launches-dlp-agentic-ai-secure-data-used-autonomous-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Teleport Launches Agentic Identity Framework for Secure AI Agent Management (2026-01-27)</b><br/>
    <p>Teleport released its Agentic Identity Framework, enabling persistent, traceable identity management for enterprise AI agents and digital assistants. As organizations deploy agentic AI in operational processes, enterprise leaders are demanding robust audit trails, granular access control, and verified agent actions. The framework supports secure, compliant agentic AI deployments within complex SaaS stacks (like Workday), representing a pivotal evolution for clients in regulated sectors. Deloitte teams can use this as a differentiator and reassurance in client engagements. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/27/teleport-launches-agentic-identity-framework-secure-ai-agents-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Details here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Workday’s Conversational AI Transforms Complexity for Global Healthcare Giant (Workday/Medtronic Case Study)</b><br/>
    <p>Workday's partnership with Medtronic offers a showcase for deploying AI-driven digital assistants in a demanding healthcare environment. The transformation highlights Workday's strengths in integrating complex, multi-jurisdictional data, automating key workflows, and enhancing employee experiences while remaining compliant with sector regulations. This case is a potent resource for Deloitte teams engaging with large healthcare or regulated clients, providing a roadmap for successful HCM modernization. <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/customer-stories/i-p/medtronic-complexity-into-clarity-conversational-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the case study</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>ADP</b><br/>
    <p>ADP continues to market its AI agent capabilities for payroll and HR automation, focusing on productivity gains, event-driven automation, and regulatory compliance. This intensifies competition for Workday in the intelligent automation and agent enablement segments. Deloitte’s teams must clearly articulate the governance and integration advantages of the Workday ecosystem compared to AI “point” solutions. <a href="https://www.adp.com/what-we-offer/ai-solutions/ai-agents.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Teleport</b><br/>
    <p>Teleport’s Agentic Identity Framework sets a new governance and compliance benchmark by giving autonomous digital agents their own auditable identities. This move will drive client expectation for similarly granular controls in all SaaS HR implementations, including those leveraging Workday and consulting partners like Deloitte. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/27/teleport-launches-agentic-identity-framework-secure-ai-agents-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>MIND</b><br/>
    <p>By launching focused DLP services for agentic AI, MIND meets heightened client demand for data lifecycle risk management in autonomous digital operations. As organizations consider migrating sensitive workflows to autonomous SaaS, Workday stakeholders and Deloitte practices should prioritize similar data safeguards. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/mind-launches-dlp-agentic-ai-secure-data-used-autonomous-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reference</a></p>

Meanwhile, Workday continues to demonstrate differentiated value in complex healthcare deployments, reinforcing the strategic necessity of reliable, human-centered HCM solutions.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;MIND launches Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Agentic AI to Secure Data Used by Autonomous Systems (2026-01-28)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;MIND unveiled a dedicated Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system tailored specifically for agentic AI and autonomous workflows, reflecting rising enterprise concern about inadvertent or malicious exposure of sensitive data through increasingly autonomous SaaS and HR systems. This DLP platform addresses the unique risks posed by agentic AI—capable of taking initiative and making decisions without direct human oversight—by embedding enterprise-grade controls and monitoring mechanisms.\\n\\nStrategically, this development acknowledges a key friction point for Workday clients seeking to adopt advanced AI: the intersection of AI enablement and data governance. As organizations integrate agentic AI more deeply into functions like recruiting, onboarding, payroll, and more, the risk profile intensifies, making robust DLP indispensable. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this launch signals an opportunity and a challenge: opportunities to partner with clients on secure AI adoption, and pressure to ensure all AI solutions pass stringent compliance muster. Embedding such risk-oriented innovations directly into HR technology stacks strengthens trust and paves the way for broader AI transformation in people operations.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/mind-launches-dlp-agentic-ai-secure-data-used-autonomous-systems\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Teleport Launches Agentic Identity Framework for Secure AI Agent Management (2026-01-27)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On January 27, Teleport announced the rollout of its Agentic Identity Framework—a solution designed to provide persistent, auditable identity management for AI agents operating in production enterprise environments. The framework uniquely allows organizations to assign and manage identity, access controls, and behavioral oversight for autonomous software agents across hybrid SaaS ecosystems, including HR and ERP.\\n\\nThis capability is becoming crucial as agentic AI becomes embedded in HR and operations platforms such as Workday, Oracle, or ServiceNow, where actionable tasks are automated. Strategically, persistent identity for AI agents aligns with enterprise compliance requirements (for example, audit trails and least-privilege access) and mitigates a key resistance factor for CIOs and CHROs—fear of “rogue” agents or untraceable automated actions. For Deloitte’s Workday teams and their clients, the framework could enable safer and more governable experimentation with autonomous HR workflows, strengthening both compliance and the business case for AI-driven efficiencies.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/27/teleport-launches-agentic-identity-framework-secure-ai-agents-production\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday&#x27;s Conversational AI Transforms Complexity for Global Healthcare Giant (Undated but topically relevant as Workday showcases sector value)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s case study with Medtronic highlights the real-world value of applying conversational AI within a highly complex, regulated, and geographically dispersed healthcare environment. The deployment story demonstrates Workday’s ability to unify disparate data, automate labor-intensive workflows, and offer a consistent, secure employee experience through AI-powered digital assistants.\\n\\nFor the healthcare sector—often characterized by legacy systems, privacy mandates, and talent shortages—a successful Workday rollout backed by conversational AI capability establishes a template for the broader industry. Importantly, the case study underlines how human-centric AI, strong data security, and robust integration can address pain points around operational complexity and regulatory compliance. For Deloitte and Workday implementation partners, such sector-specific exemplars reinforce the consultative value proposition and provide compelling proof points when advising hospital networks or global pharma on digital HCM transformation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/customer-stories/i-p/medtronic-complexity-into-clarity-conversational-ai.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ADP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;ADP continues to emphasize its AI Agent offerings for payroll and HR, spotlighting automation, self-service, and compliance-aware decision-making in the agentic AI space.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ADP’s explicit focus on AI agents demonstrates that competition in next-generation HR technology is intensifying around workforce automation and the safety of autonomous agents. For Workday, this heightens the imperative to both advance its agentic capabilities and differentiate on governance, integration, and trusted outcomes. Deloitte’s Workday teams must be conversant in ADP’s use cases—and guide clients on the advantages of Workday’s integrated, governed AI approach versus “point” agentic solutions.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Teradata Unveils Enterprise AgentStack to Accelerate Agentic AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Teradata Unveils Enterprise AgentStack to Accelerate Agentic AI. SAN DIEGO , Jan. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Teradata (NYSE: TDC) today announced Enterprise AgentStack, designed to help enterprises to move from isolated pilots to production-grade autonomy quickly, even across multi-agent and hybrid environments. **Product Description**Teradata Enterprise AgentStack is an open and connected stack that unifies the AI agent lifecycle to deliver production-ready agents with context and interoperability across hybrid environments. Unlike fragmented solutions, Teradata delivers production-ready agents, backed by integrated security, governance, and context. Agents access Teradata&#x27;s context intelligence—industry data models, frameworks, and expert prompts—combined with tools from cloud service providers, NVIDIA, and open LLM APIs. Pre-built agents include Customer Lifetime Value, SQL optimization, data science workflows, and system monitoring. By pairing Teradata&#x27;s analytic performance and trusted data foundation with our no-code agentic AI platform, organizations can transform static data into dynamic, intelligent workflows. It provides ready-to-use components for discovering, orchestrating, and integrating mission-critical Teradata data into agent workflows—enabling fast, secure, context-rich interactions between AI models and Teradata&#x27;s analytics and AI platform.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sethi views this automation as the \&quot;magic sauce\&quot; for employee upskilling and strategic focus.  “We see AI as a partner—it handles the routine tasks, freeing up our people to be more strategic,” he says.\n\nThe next wave for Medtronic will be agentic, with Sethi excited for native, data-connected Workday AI agents for recruiting, talent, and onboarding. He says this is an incredible win to have these built into the Workday platform.\n\n## Because progress starts with people.\n\nFor Sethi, Medtronic’s AI transformation is successful only if it remains human-centric. This means upskilling the workforce alongside the technology deployment. AI is not about remediating people, but about giving them new pathways for development, new skills, and new toolkits.\n\n## Because progress starts with people. [...] The Paradox platform also took over the administrative burden of coordinating interviews among candidates, recruiters, internal teams, and hiring managers, eliminating the lengthy back-and-forth and freeing up time to pursue higher-value work.\n\nSethi views this automation as the \&quot;magic sauce\&quot; for employee upskilling and strategic focus.  “We see AI as a partner—it handles the routine tasks, freeing up our people to be more strategic,” he says.\n\nThe next wave for Medtronic will be agentic, with Sethi excited for native, data-connected Workday AI agents for recruiting, talent, and onboarding. He says this is an incredible win to have these built into the Workday platform.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The AI visualization tech stack: From 2D to holograms&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The first use cases are those in which the consequences of a bad decision are life-threatening, typically in medical and defence applications. The cognitive load and side effects of individual solutions are too much to accept in these situations. But physical AI is quickly encroaching into these high-consequence areas. Autonomous systems are driving our cars, running our factories, and are moving into these high-consequence areas that already demand human-in-the-loop decisions. Holograms allow teams to use their own spatial reasoning to identify simulation-to-reality gaps that may be invisible in other mediums.\n\n## The future of the visualization stack [...] #### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace [...] #### 2. VR: the immersive workspace\n\nVR offers that first jump beyond 2D. By completely immersing yourself in the 3D world, you gain a capability that is accessible and effective. When training a robotic system, being in the place of the autonomous system, helping that system by showing the human movement and training the system, VR is the place to be. But you are inherently by yourself. Even with avatars, you’ve lost touch with reality; only the digital world exists.\n\n#### 3. AR: the expert in your ear&quot;,

Another conduit is the AI-powered “gigs” marketplace, which matches employees to projects where their skills can be helpful, even outside the scope of their normal role.\n\n“It really stretches workmates to get out of their comfort zone, to work on a problem in a different part of the company,” Ernst says.\n\nHe breaks down the data to show how these experiences are mobilizing the workforce and opening new doors. Over 18 months, more than 5,000 employees have participated in a gig; this group saw a 42% increase in internal mobility compared to non-participants, and a 33% reduction in attrition.&quot;,

AI for operational excellence:AI is rapidly becoming a foundation for operational excellence for mining and metals operations, helping companies realise productivity uplifts while prioritising safety, addressing workforce gaps, safeguarding operations against cyberthreats and more. Companies that deploy AI strategically, rather than tactically, could find themselves better positioned to anticipate risks, protect their people, and seize emerging opportunities. [...] 7. The next evolution of human resources (HR):Generative AI (GenAI) has already begun reshaping HR processes and functions in mining and metals, but the next horizon - agentic AI - will likely require a rethink of how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how humans and digital agents collaborate. For Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), this is not just a technology challenge but a leadership imperative. By balancing their responsibilities as business owners, workforce leaders, and people stewards, they can harness AI’s potential while keeping humans at the centre.&quot;,

UmesH77_2-1767673490576.jpeg\n\nUmesH77_2-1767673490576.jpeg\n\n## Why HRSD is Important for Organizations\n\nHRSD directly impacts both employee experience and business productivity.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\nImproved employee engagement\n\nFaster HR case resolution\n\nReduced manual effort for HR teams\n\nBetter collaboration across HR, IT, Finance, and Facilities\n\nConsistent and compliant HR service delivery [...] Consistent and compliant HR service delivery\n\nWhen HR services are simple and reliable, employees spend less time following up and more time focusing on their core responsibilities.\n\n## Real-Life HRSD Use Case\n\nPayroll Query Example\n\nAn employee has a payroll-related issue but doesn’t know which team handles it.  \nWithout HRSD, the request may move between multiple teams, causing delays.\n\nWith HRSD:\n\nThe employee submits a payroll request through the HR portal\n\nThe case is automatically routed to the correct team\n\nStatus updates and SLAs are tracked centrally\n\nThis ensures faster resolution and a better employee experience.\n\n## Key Features of ServiceNow HRSD\n\n### HR Case &amp; Knowledge Management&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Digital Platforms: where tax teams can provide strategic value&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We are already seeing this future in action. Cloud computing providers are simplifying AI development through their platforms, allowing businesses of all sizes to create intelligent chatbots, automate tasks, and unlock the power of data analytics. [...] #### Moving forward: embracing digital platforms\n\nDigital platforms are an every-day part of modern business. For tax and legal leaders, this means moving beyond traditional reactive roles. By embracing platform-based models, integrating GenAI applications, and being proactively involved, tax teams are well placed to help businesses unlock value in an increasingly interconnected business environment.\n\nTax teams should engage actively with business, legal, and technology teams to ensure tax implications are understood, addressed, and integrated into every stage of platform development and deployment. This proactive stance will empower your business to unlock unprecedented value and thrive in the increasingly interconnected global environment. [...] The use of platforms is widespread and impacts many different businesses across geographies and industry sectors, demonstrating its broad application and benefits. From e-Commerce giants to ride-sharing apps, platforms are reshaping how businesses operate and interact with their customers and each other.\n\nSupply chains have evolved from linear sequences to dynamic, digitalised webs, and platforms have played an essential role in transforming how businesses operate and go to market.\n\n#### How GenAI can amplify the power of platforms\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) adds another layer of opportunity, pushing the boundaries of what platforms can achieve.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;7. The next evolution of human resources (HR):Generative AI (GenAI) has already begun reshaping HR processes and functions in mining and metals, but the next horizon - agentic AI - will likely require a rethink of how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how humans and digital agents collaborate. For Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), this is not just a technology challenge but a leadership imperative. By balancing their responsibilities as business owners, workforce leaders, and people stewards, they can harness AI’s potential while keeping humans at the centre. [...] 6. AI for operational excellence:AI is rapidly becoming a foundation for operational excellence for mining and metals operations, helping companies realise productivity uplifts while prioritising safety, addressing workforce gaps, safeguarding operations against cyberthreats and more. Companies that deploy AI strategically, rather than tactically, could find themselves better positioned to anticipate risks, protect their people, and seize emerging opportunities. [...] “Our abundant critical mineral supply, once seen primarily as an energy transition enabler, is now at the centre of global national security discussions. Companies are expected to balance powering clean energy with reinforcing defence strategies, all while meeting growing consumer demand.\n\n“Meanwhile, the exponential growth of AI is presenting transformative opportunities to elevate operational resilience and competitiveness by boosting productivity and revolutionising mineral discovery. Off-site, the arrival of agentic AI is forcing a rethink of how workforces should be structured in a world where humans and agents work side by side.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Three Key Trends Likely to Shape Medtech in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] Our analysis: AI capability is rapidly becoming the primary competitive differentiator in medtech. The gap between leaders and laggards will likely compound over time as data and processes mature, as talent grows, and as organizational learning expands. This could also accelerate consolidation as companies that lack the resources needed to build comprehensive AI capabilities become acquisition targets. A key determinant of success might be the ability to balance speed with responsibility. Companies should try to move fast enough to avoid competitive obsolescence while maintaining governance rigor that ensures patient safety, data privacy, and regulatory compliance. AI systems should be designed for quality and should also be easily auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To help organizations safely accelerate agentic AI adoption, Workday is building solutions that work with Agent 365 for a unified way to govern its agents. The company is helping businesses address the shift from shadow IT to shadow AI as employees begin incorporating AI agents into the way they work. Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight. [...] how advanced workflow AI delivers its greatest value when paired with enterprise-wide governance — giving organizations the speed and efficiency they want while maintaining the control required for mission critical operations.

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

[...] There’s a lot of enthusiasm around what AI can do for work: faster answers, greater efficiency, new levels of productivity. In equal measure, there’s an underlying question: Are we designing workplaces that bring us together, or pull us further apart?\n\nThis tension guided a thoughtful conversation on the Future of Work podcast between Workday Chief Learning Officer Chris Ernst and Chief Philanthropy Officer Carrie Varoquiers.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

The combined impact of geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory change, technological advances, and sustainability requirements necessitates a reassessment of strategic priorities. In our point of view, the six forces are translated into practical considerations for executive decision‑makers:\n\n1. Re-architect networks for resilience\n\n2. Scale platforms &amp; AI\n\n3. Consolidate and integrate vertically\n\n4. Modernise fleets—with finance\n\n5. Operationalise sustainability\n\n6. Build digital talent &amp; governance\n\nDownload the point of view to gain further insights.\n\n### Methodology [...] The point of view’s key messages underline that global trends are highly relevant to Europe but manifest themselves in distinct ways across the region. European logistics providers must therefore actively manage geopolitical risks, regulatory complexity, and rapidly evolving technological opportunities. Strategic options lie in the intelligent combination of targeted investments, strong partnerships, and comprehensive digital transformation.\n\n### The Growing Pressure on European Logistics&quot;,

Georgieva reiterated that in advanced economies, one in ten jobs has already been augmented by AI, delivering benefits to those economies.\n\n###### The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, predicts that the disruption caused by trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions will not be fully reversed. The WTO leader believes that the uncertainty of the current global context prevents a return to the previous state of global trade. [...] KPMG was an integral part of this gathering, which brought together thousands of people from around the world to focus on technological advancements and trade relationships that affect the global economy. For this reason, our organization took part in multiple panels, sharing valuable insights on digital innovation and AI, always guided by the pursuit of a more sustainable future for the business sector.\n\nRead a summary of the key events and interventions that marked a week that proved decisive for discussions on today’s most important issues. [...] ###### Joining the criticism of the Donald Trump administration in Davos was Emmanuel Macron. The French President warned that Europe could activate the Anti-Coercion Instrument, a mechanism that allows the European Union to impose punitive economic measures, if the United States increases trade tariffs on European countries. Macron added that it makes no sense to threaten allies with tariffs, referring to Donald Trump’s position on Greenland. On the other hand, the French head of state stressed that it is essential for Europe to invest in innovative areas such as AI and clean energy.&quot;,

For Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), this is not just a technology challenge but a leadership imperative. By balancing their responsibilities as business owners, workforce leaders, and people stewards, they can harness AI’s potential while keeping humans at the centre. [...] 6. AI for operational excellence:AI is rapidly becoming a foundation for operational excellence for mining and metals operations, helping companies realise productivity uplifts while prioritising safety, addressing workforce gaps, safeguarding operations against cyberthreats and more. Companies that deploy AI strategically, rather than tactically, could find themselves better positioned to anticipate risks, protect their people, and seize emerging opportunities. [...] “Our abundant critical mineral supply, once seen primarily as an energy transition enabler, is now at the centre of global national security discussions. Companies are expected to balance powering clean energy with reinforcing defence strategies, all while meeting growing consumer demand.\n\n“Meanwhile, the exponential growth of AI is presenting transformative opportunities to elevate operational resilience and competitiveness by boosting productivity and revolutionising mineral discovery. Off-site, the arrival of agentic AI is forcing a rethink of how workforces should be structured in a world where humans and agents work side by side.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Three Key Trends Likely to Shape Medtech in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other [...] Our analysis: AI capability is rapidly becoming the primary competitive differentiator in medtech. The gap between leaders and laggards will likely compound over time as data and processes mature, as talent grows, and as organizational learning expands. This could also accelerate consolidation as companies that lack the resources needed to build comprehensive AI capabilities become acquisition targets. A key determinant of success might be the ability to balance speed with responsibility. Companies should try to move fast enough to avoid competitive obsolescence while maintaining governance rigor that ensures patient safety, data privacy, and regulatory compliance. AI systems should be designed for quality and should also be easily auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Inside Google&#x27;s vision to make Gmail your personal AI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Also: 10 ways AI can inflict unprecedented damage in 2026\n\nIf there&#x27;s something hot, that changes my pacing. As soon as I do the most minimal of morning prep, I&#x27;ll sit myself down at the computer to deal with whatever is breaking. If there&#x27;s nothing on fire, I know I can have a leisurely wake-up and morning prep, gently easing into my workday.\n\nNot everyone has my morning threat-assessment ritual. But there are roughly three billion (yes, billion) people who use Gmail. There are billions of people who, like me, spend hours each day in the app, managing their lives. There are billions of people for whom Gmail is, quite literally, the central dashboard of their lives. [...] ## Email is more than just email\n\nLast week, when I covered Gmail&#x27;s new AI features, I was somewhat disappointed. Some of the features announced weren&#x27;t available to me. Some were features I just didn&#x27;t see myself using. Some features I tried produced errors, as AI often does.\n\nBut my discussion with Barnes course-corrected my interpretation.\n\nAlso: I used 20 Gemini prompts to find the cheapest flight possible - here&#x27;s what happened\n\nGmail&#x27;s AI update isn&#x27;t just about the ability to summarize a thread or draft a reply. Those features are now basic table stakes in anything that can make an AI API call. What&#x27;s interesting is that Google is on a path where it is trying to redefine and refine what an inbox can do for you. [...] He said it is trying to stay focused on the problems that a lot of us experience day to day. The world is busy, there&#x27;s lots going on, there&#x27;s lots to juggle, and there&#x27;s lots of life management tasks to handle, whether that&#x27;s traveling, whether that&#x27;s communicating with friends and family, or whether it&#x27;s working through errands.\n\nAlso:I let Gemini Deep Research dig through my Gmail and Drive - here&#x27;s what it uncovered\n\nEssentially, Google is working on the premise that if email sits at the center of work and personal logistics, then the inbox can&#x27;t just remain a passive stream.\n\nHe told me, \&quot;Ultimately, all of these things ladder up to the vision of trying to help people to manage their life and not just their messages.\&quot;\n\n## Moving from sorting to interpretation&quot;,

What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset. This is not deploying a technology tool; this is deploying a whole new way of thinking and working. \n\n#### What are you excited about on the HR front?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The AI visualization tech stack: From 2D to holograms&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Further, there’s no onboarding friction with a hologram. No special equipment is required — simply walk into the light field and you see the hologram. There’s none of the discomfort or isolation that comes with wearable devices. Everyone can see the hologram together, immediately.\n\n## When to choose holograms\n\nThere are many situations where humans need to act with spatial intelligence. When alone, individual mediums like screens and AR/VR are great solutions and should be the first choice. But when there are high stakes, when discussion, collaboration, and trust between people are paramount, nothing can approach the value that holographics bring to the table. [...] #### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace [...] #### 2. VR: the immersive workspace\n\nVR offers that first jump beyond 2D. By completely immersing yourself in the 3D world, you gain a capability that is accessible and effective. When training a robotic system, being in the place of the autonomous system, helping that system by showing the human movement and training the system, VR is the place to be. But you are inherently by yourself. Even with avatars, you’ve lost touch with reality; only the digital world exists.\n\n#### 3. AR: the expert in your ear&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To help organizations safely accelerate agentic AI adoption, Workday is building solutions that work with Agent 365 for a unified way to govern its agents. The company is helping businesses address the shift from shadow IT to shadow AI as employees begin incorporating AI agents into the way they work. Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight. [...] Westpac is bringing Copilot to more than 35,000 employees across its global workforce — the largest Microsoft 365 Copilot rollout to date in Australia and the largest deployment in financial services within Asia Pacific. This comes after a successful pilot with 15,000 employees that delivered strong business outcomes and freed up significant time for users each month. The company is now deploying AI to accelerate work, reduce friction and reinvent how employees engage with their customers. The bank is pairing its Copilot implementation with AI education programs and Microsoft Copilot Studio to build custom agents for HR and IT, while creating a new Azure-based innovation sandbox to enable teams to quickly experiment with AI-enabled workflows and solutions.

By enabling them to bring their agentic workflows into a unified governance environment, ServiceNow can help them gain visibility, access controls and ensure compliance across AI systems. Companies like AstraZeneca are already using ServiceNow AI Control Tower together with Agent 365 to manage lab and operational workflows, saving 90,000 hours that researchers can redirect toward discovering lifesaving drugs. The ability to see, trust and scale AI agents gives organizations confidence to move quickly without losing control. ServiceNow is demonstrating how advanced workflow AI delivers its greatest value when&quot;,

As a leader, I have to come up with a three-year strategic plan of how we’re going to leverage AI in HR. It’s really exciting capitalizing on some of the momentum that’s in our organization but also thinking about how we can reimagine some of the work and think big and think differently. \n\n#### What are you interested in outside of work?\n\nI love music. I love live music. I like going to concerts. I’m getting my lineup ready for this year. [...] #### HR DIVE: How is the role of HR changing?\n\nJOANNE RODGERS: Now is the greatest time to be in HR, because I feel like there is so much going on around transformational work, whether or not that’s related to AI or evolving how organizations operate. HR is really front and center. I’ve seen a shift where we were always a partner, but now we are really driving thought leadership in many spaces. We’re ultimately driving business outcomes. \n\n#### What is your approach to leading change?\n\nWhen you think about any organizational change, it really is about people, and I really think it&#x27;s about preparing them with the mindset, skill set and tool set. \n\n#### Do you have any advice for other organizations on AI adoption? [...] We’re very fortunate. Our CEO is very forward-thinking and really sees the power of AI. What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset. This is not deploying a technology tool; this is deploying a whole new way of thinking and working. \n\n#### What are you excited about on the HR front?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The AI visualization tech stack: From 2D to holograms&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace [...] The first use cases are those in which the consequences of a bad decision are life-threatening, typically in medical and defence applications. The cognitive load and side effects of individual solutions are too much to accept in these situations. But physical AI is quickly encroaching into these high-consequence areas. Autonomous systems are driving our cars, running our factories, and are moving into these high-consequence areas that already demand human-in-the-loop decisions. Holograms allow teams to use their own spatial reasoning to identify simulation-to-reality gaps that may be invisible in other mediums.\n\n## The future of the visualization stack [...] Wally Haas is president of Avalon Holographics.\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Three Key Trends Likely to Shape Medtech in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other [...] Latest news from @DeloitteHealth\n\nEndnotes\n\niBased on a Deloitte analysis of data from Evaluate Medtech-medical device insights  \niiQ3 2025 medtech licensing and venture report, J.P.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Three Key Trends Likely to Shape Medtech in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other [...] Latest news from @DeloitteHealth\n\nEndnotes\n\niBased on a Deloitte analysis of data from Evaluate Medtech-medical device insights  \niiQ3 2025 medtech licensing and venture report, J.P.

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Make work deeply experiential, helping people understand the “why,” not just the “what”\n Keep work social, encouraging collaboration and shared problem-solving\n Support work that is deliberately developmental, building skills over time\n\nWhen AI applications are designed this way, you can mitigate the risks and maximize the opportunity for human growth.\n\n## AI as a Connector to Relationships and Opportunities\n\nAt Workday, some of the most successful AI initiatives were shared experiences: prompt-a-thons, games, team challenges, and town halls where employees tell their own AI stories. [...] There’s a lot of enthusiasm around what AI can do for work: faster answers, greater efficiency, new levels of productivity. In equal measure, there’s an underlying question: Are we designing workplaces that bring us together, or pull us further apart?\n\nThis tension guided a thoughtful conversation on the Future of Work podcast between Workday Chief Learning Officer Chris Ernst and Chief Philanthropy Officer Carrie Varoquiers. The two discussed how the real opportunity isn&#x27;t just using AI to help us do more, it’s using AI to help us connect more.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Voice of the Employee: Addressing Burnout Risk\n\nRead Now\n\n## Loneliness Isn’t a Soft Problem [...] # Why Human Connection Is the Missing Link in AI\n\nWorkday’s Chris Ernst and Carrie Varoquiers explain why intentional design is the key to making AI a catalyst, not a deterrent, for connection and innovation.\n\nEmily Faracca\n\nMultimedia Content Writer\n\nWorkday\n\nIn this article\n\nJanuary 27, 2026   15 min listen\n\n4.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To help organizations safely accelerate agentic AI adoption, Workday is building solutions that work with Agent 365 for a unified way to govern its agents. The company is helping businesses address the shift from shadow IT to shadow AI as employees begin incorporating AI agents into the way they work. Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight.

As a leader, I have to come up with a three-year strategic plan of how we’re going to leverage AI in HR. It’s really exciting capitalizing on some of the momentum that’s in our organization but also thinking about how we can reimagine some of the work and think big and think differently. \n\n#### What are you interested in outside of work?\n\nI love music. I love live music. I like going to concerts. I’m getting my lineup ready for this year. [...] We’re very fortunate. Our CEO is very forward-thinking and really sees the power of AI. What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace\n\nVR offers that first jump beyond 2D. By completely immersing yourself in the 3D world, you gain a capability that is accessible and effective. When training a robotic system, being in the place of the autonomous system, helping that system by showing the human movement and training the system, VR is the place to be. But you are inherently by yourself. Even with avatars, you’ve lost touch with reality; only the digital world exists.\n\n#### 3. AR: the expert in your ear [...] ## The power of the shared physical context\n\nThe true value of the holographic display in the era of physical AI lies in the ability to solve the referential ambiguity problem. In a holographic environment, the light rays are physically reconstructed. Multiple people look at the same reconstruction from individual perspectives; if I point at a joint in a humanoid robot, a cancerous tumour, cover versus concealment, there’s no ambiguity about what I am pointing at. Everyone knows EXACTLY what I’m pointing at. This shared experience, where I can see you, your full reaction, and you can see mine, creates a level of trust that no other medium can match. [...] #### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace&quot;,

Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report.

Cyber risk is closely interconnected with other risks such as data management, privacy, supply chain, compliance, and interruption of critical business systems.&quot;,

[...] ### WHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThe U.K. tax authorities (HMRC) will notify employers of the ‘Scottish taxpayer’ status of their employees for most payroll withholding purposes. However, employers that operate Appendix 6 modified payroll agreements for tax-equalised expatriates might need to determine whether individuals included in a modified payroll scheme are Scottish taxpayers based on the applicable statutory tests, relevant facts, and HMRC’s published guidance on Scottish taxpayer status and apply the relevant Scottish rates where appropriate.3\n\nEmployers may also need to take account of Scottish rates of income tax when calculating the tax due under a ‘pay as you earn’ (PAYE) Settlement Agreement to pay income tax on employees’ behalf on minor or irregular benefits.&quot;,

Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight.

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other [...] Latest news from @DeloitteHealth\n\nEndnotes\n\niBased on a Deloitte analysis of data from Evaluate Medtech-medical device insights  \niiQ3 2025 medtech licensing and venture report, J.P.

Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The AI visualization tech stack: From 2D to holograms&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Further, there’s no onboarding friction with a hologram. No special equipment is required — simply walk into the light field and you see the hologram. There’s none of the discomfort or isolation that comes with wearable devices. Everyone can see the hologram together, immediately.\n\n## When to choose holograms\n\nThere are many situations where humans need to act with spatial intelligence. When alone, individual mediums like screens and AR/VR are great solutions and should be the first choice. But when there are high stakes, when discussion, collaboration, and trust between people are paramount, nothing can approach the value that holographics bring to the table. [...] #### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace [...] #### 2. VR: the immersive workspace\n\nVR offers that first jump beyond 2D. By completely immersing yourself in the 3D world, you gain a capability that is accessible and effective. When training a robotic system, being in the place of the autonomous system, helping that system by showing the human movement and training the system, VR is the place to be. But you are inherently by yourself. Even with avatars, you’ve lost touch with reality; only the digital world exists.\n\n#### 3. AR: the expert in your ear&quot;,

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

[...] There’s a lot of enthusiasm around what AI can do for work: faster answers, greater efficiency, new levels of productivity. In equal measure, there’s an underlying question: Are we designing workplaces that bring us together, or pull us further apart?\n\nThis tension guided a thoughtful conversation on the Future of Work podcast between Workday Chief Learning Officer Chris Ernst and Chief Philanthropy Officer Carrie Varoquiers.

What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset.

Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To help organizations safely accelerate agentic AI adoption, Workday is building solutions that work with Agent 365 for a unified way to govern its agents. The company is helping businesses address the shift from shadow IT to shadow AI as employees begin incorporating AI agents into the way they work. Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight. [...] how advanced workflow AI delivers its greatest value when paired with enterprise-wide governance — giving organizations the speed and efficiency they want while maintaining the control required for mission critical operations.

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The medtech industry is witnessing a transformative shift as AI becomes integral to innovation and operational strategies (see Can agentic AI improve workflows and margins in medtech?). AI can be more than a technology investment. It can be a core capability that can drive advancements across the organization. Many medtech companies are embedding AI across their operations, transforming how they deliver care and how they operate their businesses. However, execution and adoption across the industry remains uneven, with significant challenges in data quality, regulatory compliance, and change management.vii As such, some industry leaders are focusing on investments in critical enablers first—including data governance, talent, and robust processes—to establish a strong foundation to fully [...] auditable. An effective AI strategy should include clear problem statements, explicit regulatory and privacy inputs, documented verification and validation protocols, and formalized human roles. This can make it easier for auditors to trace how AI outputs are reviewed before they affect patients or regulatory submissions. Success will also likely depend on centralizing and standardizing core business processes to enable scalable AI solutions in what has traditionally been a highly decentralized sector. Treating data as a governed and shared asset, solving interoperability and ownership issues, and partnering with big tech on infrastructure—while keeping sensitive data inside the organization’s walls—could be important for effectively and compliantly scaling the use of AI and other [...] Latest news from @DeloitteHealth\n\nEndnotes\n\niBased on a Deloitte analysis of data from Evaluate Medtech-medical device insights  \niiQ3 2025 medtech licensing and venture report, J.P.

Medtronic set a goal to automate 80% of HR processes. “We can advance the way we provide service to our organization by embedding AI into nearly all the processes that we run for HR,” says Sethi. [...] Paramount to this vision is that it is human-led. For Sethi, AI is a companion, but will never be a human replacement. He believes AI governance and ethical and emotional decision-making are distinctly human strengths. Sethi knew driving AI innovation for the organization and employees required cutting edge technology. Critical to this AI journey was unlocking capabilities with Workday AI and Workday-acquired Paradox.\n\n## Automating the manual, augmenting the human.\n\nThe company streamlined two unique cases with AI-powered conversational recruiting software from Paradox. Firstly, using the conversational ‘chat to apply’ feature to allow candidates to easily submit an application into Workday without navigating the complexities of a traditional talent management system.&quot;,

[...] There’s a lot of enthusiasm around what AI can do for work: faster answers, greater efficiency, new levels of productivity. In equal measure, there’s an underlying question: Are we designing workplaces that bring us together, or pull us further apart?\n\nThis tension guided a thoughtful conversation on the Future of Work podcast between Workday Chief Learning Officer Chris Ernst and Chief Philanthropy Officer Carrie Varoquiers. The two discussed how the real opportunity isn&#x27;t just using AI to help us do more, it’s using AI to help us connect more.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Voice of the Employee: Addressing Burnout Risk\n\nRead Now\n\n## Loneliness Isn’t a Soft Problem [...] # Why Human Connection Is the Missing Link in AI\n\nWorkday’s Chris Ernst and Carrie Varoquiers explain why intentional design is the key to making AI a catalyst, not a deterrent, for connection and innovation.\n\nEmily Faracca\n\nMultimedia Content Writer\n\nWorkday\n\nIn this article\n\nJanuary 27, 2026   15 min listen\n\n4.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Further, there’s no onboarding friction with a hologram. No special equipment is required — simply walk into the light field and you see the hologram. There’s none of the discomfort or isolation that comes with wearable devices. Everyone can see the hologram together, immediately.\n\n## When to choose holograms\n\nThere are many situations where humans need to act with spatial intelligence. When alone, individual mediums like screens and AR/VR are great solutions and should be the first choice. But when there are high stakes, when discussion, collaboration, and trust between people are paramount, nothing can approach the value that holographics bring to the table. [...] #### 1. The 2D screen: the precision desktop\n\nThe 2D screen has been the reliable workhorse since spatial computing started and continues to be the primary interface, with most professional work still happening here. For a developer training a model or a single user doing 3D modeling, the 2D screen is great for the individual contributor. However, using a 2D screen forces a “3D-to-2D” mental translation, where the user has to keep the model in their mind, rotating, zooming, and interacting with this specific corner of the spatial world. The cognitive load of this mental model can cause the brain to work overtime to understand it.\n\n#### 2. VR: the immersive workspace [...] #### 2. VR: the immersive workspace\n\nVR offers that first jump beyond 2D. By completely immersing yourself in the 3D world, you gain a capability that is accessible and effective. When training a robotic system, being in the place of the autonomous system, helping that system by showing the human movement and training the system, VR is the place to be. But you are inherently by yourself. Even with avatars, you’ve lost touch with reality; only the digital world exists.\n\n#### 3. AR: the expert in your ear&quot;,

[...] # Why Human Connection Is the Missing Link in AI\n\nWorkday’s Chris Ernst and Carrie Varoquiers explain why intentional design is the key to making AI a catalyst, not a deterrent, for connection and innovation.\n\nEmily Faracca\n\nMultimedia Content Writer\n\nWorkday\n\nIn this article\n\nJanuary 27, 2026   15 min listen\n\n4. Link Copied\n\nAudio also available onApple PodcastsandSpotify.\n\nIt’s a Tuesday afternoon. Your inbox is clear, your reports are generated in seconds, and your AI assistant has scheduled your entire week. By every traditional metric of productivity, you’ve won. But perhaps, despite your cleared to-do list, you feel a nagging sense of isolation. You’ve had fifty digital interactions today, but not a single human connection. [...] There’s a lot of enthusiasm around what AI can do for work: faster answers, greater efficiency, new levels of productivity. In equal measure, there’s an underlying question: Are we designing workplaces that bring us together, or pull us further apart?\n\nThis tension guided a thoughtful conversation on the Future of Work podcast between Workday Chief Learning Officer Chris Ernst and Chief Philanthropy Officer Carrie Varoquiers. The two discussed how the real opportunity isn&#x27;t just using AI to help us do more, it’s using AI to help us connect more.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Voice of the Employee: Addressing Burnout Risk\n\nRead Now\n\n## Loneliness Isn’t a Soft Problem&quot;,

What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ## Company Announcements\n\nView all | Post a press release\n\nTuition.io Launches “Quick Start” Student Loan Wellness Solution to Protect Employers from Imp…\n\nFrom Tuition.io\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 PerkSpot Enhances Its Employee Discount Solution with Launch of New Travel Booking Portal Powe…\n\nFrom HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 HR Consulting Firm Assessment Technologies Group Rebrands as QubitHR\n\nFrom QubitHR\n\nJanuary 13, 2026 Benepass Raises $40M Series B to Help Employers Redesign Benefits for Rising Healthcare Costs\n\nFrom Benepass\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nEditors&#x27; picks\n\n Opinion\n\n  ### FLSA misclassification is common, costly and completely avoidable\n\n  Compliance can be easy, writes Jones Walker partner Sid Lewis, but employers too often fall asleep at the wheel.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AT&amp;T is all-in on agentic AI - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Agents as colleagues\n\nAT&amp;T has also begun using agentic AI tools to assist its employees. In 2023, working closely with Microsoft, it introduced a version of ChatGPT called Ask AT&amp;T, a gen AI platform for everything from answering employees’ HR questions and translating customer and employee documentation, to helping software developers write code.\n\nIn November, AT&amp;T upped the ante when it worked closely with Microsoft using Azure to create Ask AT&amp;T Workflows, a graphical drag-and-drop agent builder to help teams build agents to automate time-consuming tasks. [...] Even though earlier uses of AI have affected operations throughout the company’s business, he adds, gen AI and agentic AI will be even more transformative. Agents, or autonomous assistants, as AT&amp;T prefers to call them, don’t just generate content, they can plan and execute tasks from beginning to end. While agents still turn top human guidance and intervention when needed, they combine goal understanding, multi-step planning, and tool orchestration into a single package.\n\n“There’s not a single person across AT&amp;T that’s not impacted by this,” Markus says. [...] He adds that a human always oversees the chain reaction of agents, which has always required human checkpoints throughout any process. The agents are able to pull information and data from Ask Docs and Ask Data, AT&amp;T’s proprietary gen AI tools for housing the company’s information. Each action taken by an agent is logged, and data isolation, retention policies, and role-based access are enforced whenever one agent hands off a workload to another.\n\nMarkus says one of the keys to the success of AT&amp;T’s agentic AI efforts has been getting the business excited by showing them what’s possible.\n\n“We have hundreds of business cases that are waiting for us to prioritize,” he says. “That’s the result of the enthusiasm and passion of the business because they’re seeing the value here.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Approvals that bounce across tools, customer escalations buried in threads, “where’s that doc?” to-and-fro, and the kind of context-switching that turns a 10-minute task into a 60-minute safari. We are spending hours “coordinating” work rather than doing it.\n\nWe call this the “admin debt.” And the cost is staggering.\n\n According to our latest State of Work report, individuals who don’t use agents spend nearly 40% more time on administrative tasks compared to those who do. That is almost two full days a week lost to the “work of work”—time that should be spent on product innovation, market expansion, and building customer relationships.\n\nThe solution isn’t just “more AI.” It’s a different kind of AI.\n\nWelcome to the Agentic Era.\n\nSlack state of work infographic [...] Slack state of work infographic\n\n## From “chatting” to “doing”: The agentic difference\n\nFor the past few years, we’ve looked at AI as a smart reference librarian. You ask it a question, and it summarises an answer. It’s helpful, but it’s passive.\n\nAgentic AI changes the game. These aren’t just tools that offer suggestions; they are specialised digital teammates that can reason through complex challenges and act.\n\nThink of the difference this way:\n\nThat’s the promise of AI agents in the workflow: a teammate inside Slack that can reason, retrieve, and act with context. Slack’s core bet is simple: when AI lives where work already happens, it becomes grounded in conversations, permissions, and real business systems and thus, useful, safe, and measurable.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This allows organizations to embrace a “bring your own semantic layer” strategy. You can leverage existing investments in dbt or Snowflake to power downstream experiences instantly, ensuring that regardless of who is asking the question, the answer is identical.\n\nReplacing the fragile process of translating metrics between tools with a “declare once, use everywhere” model creates the trust required to embrace the agentic AI revolution. Leaders can more confidently move their organizations toward executing autonomous business actions.\n\nTo bring this vision to life, we’re focusing our contributions on three core capabilities that turn static definitions into dynamic, trusted data flows: [...] CIOs and CDAOs tell us their biggest fear isn’t data volume; it’s “metric drift.” When marketing defines “campaign ROI” differently than finance, organizational trust evaporates. The stakes have never been higher. According to our State of Data &amp; Analytics report, 89% of data leaders believe agent interoperability will soon be required to do business, yet 81% fear that disparate data schemas will limit that very interoperability.\n\nLeaders are deploying OSI not just to fix dashboards, but to ensure informed decision making in the agentic AI revolution. AI agents are the new primary consumers of enterprise data, and they cannot “guess” your business logic. Without a unified semantic foundation, an agent can hallucinate or provide inconsistent answers. [...] The future of business intelligence and agentic AI depends on a shared foundation of meaning.\n\nWe invite you to join us in defining that future:\n\n Read more about this milestone on the Snowflake blog.\n Explore the new hub of the initiative at open-semantic-interchange.org.\n\n## Join the working group today.\n\nSee the the Open Semantic Interchange specification on GitHub and begin building your semantic layer with open standards.\n\nGet Started\n\n## Share article\n\n## Just For You\n\n## Why Asset Service Management Matters in Field Service\n\n11 min read\n\n## How to Build a Small Business Intelligence Strategy in 7 Steps\n\n8 min read\n\n## Explore related content by topic\n\n Agentic AI\n Analytics\n\nSouthard Jones Chief Product Officer, Analytics&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;This new contract ... will operationalize Missionforce across the Army and DOW, delivering trusted data and seamless interoperability, and supporting the DOW&#x27;s transformation into an agentic enterprise,\&quot; Collins said, referring to the DoD as the Department of War, its unofficial nickname Trump assigned via executive order last year.\n\nAccording to Salesforce, Missionforce will provide a one-stop shop for the Army and DoD to manage personnel from hiring to retirement, merge data sources under one dashboard to enable quicker decision making, streamline workflows, and lay the aforementioned \&quot;agent-ready foundation\&quot; for the Army&#x27;s eventual widespread adoption of agentic AI. [...] Salesforce announced the 10-year deal on Monday, which it said would equip the Army with a Salesforce-based cloud data analytics system \&quot;as the foundation for its agentic enterprise,\&quot; though the company also suggested in its release that Army agentic AI is still a plan for the future, not a thing that&#x27;s being deployed alongside the new deal.\n\nThe cornerstone of the deal is Salesforce&#x27;s Missionforce, its product portfolio launched in September 2025 to address the needs of government defense, intelligence, and aerospace agencies.\n\nAccording to Salesforce Missionforce and Government Cloud CEO Kendall Collins, the deal brings Missionforce into service across the Army, unifying data and analytics while laying the groundwork for broader DoD use. [...] This also isn&#x27;t Salesforce&#x27;s first foray into making deals with the US Army, as it previously integrated its technology into the Army Human Resources Command as part of a modernization effort, and into the Army Accessions Information Environment to \&quot;accelerate and optimize recruiting pipelines,\&quot; a move that appears to have already paid off for the branch, as 2025 recruiting numbers skyrocketed after years of declines, though that hasn&#x27;t plugged the hole in high attrition rates.\n\nSalesforce didn&#x27;t immediately respond to questions for this story. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n### Broader topics\n\n#### More about\n\ncomment bubble on white\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n### Broader topics\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news&quot;,

Only 27 percent indicated they have comprehensive guidelines and practices that rigorously address security, data protection, privacy, and AI sovereignty.\n\nFor 2026, IDC says it expects to see enterprise spending on AI continue to rise, and that it will become a core part of business performance.

[...] Lenovo&#x27;s newly-published CIO Playbook 2026 claims that enterprises across Europe and the Middle East are accelerating their adoption of AI and view it as a key business enabler as they seek speedier growth and better business outcomes.\n\nBased on research carried out by IDC, the report says that some organizations are projecting average returns of $2.78 for every dollar invested in AI projects, but there are considerable challenges to realizing this goal. These include employee skills, having the right infrastructure, robust data security, sovereignty, and governance measures.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As organizations move to operationalize agentic AI at scale, Genspark is integrating with Agent 365 to provide a governed, enterprise grade path for deploying its rapidly growing ecosystem of Super Agents. As employees increasingly experiment with personal AI creation tools, companies are looking for ways to shift from unmanaged shadow AI to secure, outcome-driven agent workflows. Through Agent 365, the platform enables organizations to register its agents alongside those from Microsoft and other partners, apply unified governance policies, maintain consistent identity and permission controls, and ensure all agent generated outputs align with corporate, regulatory and data residency requirements. This governance layer extends the value of its own agent registry — where more than 80 [...] To help organizations safely accelerate agentic AI adoption, Workday is building solutions that work with Agent 365 for a unified way to govern its agents. The company is helping businesses address the shift from shadow IT to shadow AI as employees begin incorporating AI agents into the way they work. Workday’s Agent System of Record helps customers establish governance and oversight around the work AI agents are doing, allowing them to scale intelligent workflows with confidence. Workday highlights that responsible AI acceleration requires combining powerful automation with a shared control plan — making the secure, compliant path the easiest one, and enabling organizations to scale without losing oversight.

It ensures agent access is continuously evaluated based on identity, risk, and context before granting access to enterprise resources.\n\nAI agents are rapidly becoming part of everyday enterprise operations summarizing incidents, analyzing logs, orchestrating workflows, or even acting as digital colleagues. As organizations adopt these intelligent automations, securing them becomes just as important as securing human identities.

This blog breaks down what Agent Identities are, how Conditional Access applies to them, and what are current limitations.\n\nWhat Exactly Are Agent Identities?\n\nMicrosoft Entra now supports a new identity type designed specifically for AI systems:\n\nThis model exists because AI systems behave differently than humans or applications:  \nthey can act autonomously, operate continuously, and make decisions without user input.\n\nAI-driven automation must be governed and that’s where Conditional Access comes in.\n\nConditional Access for Agents, but with Important Limitations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Governed AI Agents: How to Deploy and Scale with Confidence&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organizations are racing to develop and deploy AI agents, but without a controlled process for development and deployment, adopting agents at scale risks creating confusion and technical and governance issues that IT and finance teams might be struggling with for years to come.\n\nThe solution? Applying governance and oversight to every agent deployed in the enterprise, whether it has been developed internally, provided by a platform vendor or technical partner, or purchased from an agent marketplace. Every agent needs a robust governance framework that ensures accountability, transparency, and reliability throughout the agent’s lifecycle. [...] ## Centralized Registry\n\nWith the Agentstudio centralized registry, you can manage and govern all your agents from a single pane of glass, giving you the control, consistency, and confidence that AI is operating within your enterprise standards. Register agents from across your organization, no matter where they’re built, avoiding vendor lock-in and reducing security and compliance risks. Agentstudio supports more than 30 different custom providers such as CrewAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, n8n, OpenAI, ServiceNow, Workday, and growing. Easily list these agents by simply uploading documentation to Boomi’s auto-cataloging feature, with native support for AWS Bedrock, Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot, and Snowflake.\n\n## Audit Logs [...] ## Audit Logs\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to enterprise AI adoption is the “black box” problem. When an agent fails or produces an unexpected result, developers and users need to know why. Unfortunately, that information can be hard to get in many AI agent environments.\n\nBy combining trace logs, agent session logs, and additional user activity logs, Agent Control Tower provides deep visibility into every decision an agent makes and increases auditability. Understand the agent’s reasoning and chain of thought, showing exactly what the agent was “thinking” and what influenced the outcome.\n\n## Anomaly Detection, Monitoring, and Compliance&quot;,

[...] # Enhance AI agent observability with Langfuse powered by watsonx Orchestrate\n\nBy Jobit Varughese\n\nAs the number of AI agents built grows daily, enterprises are exploring autonomous systems to support decision-making and operational workflows. At the same time, organizations often express concerns about explainability, governance and production readiness, especially in multi-agent systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for reasoning. It is a challenge to use agents in business settings that provide responses without a clear explanation or that exhibit inconsistent behavior. [...] ## Use case overview: Vendor risk intelligence\n\nThe goal of this tutorial is to build an AI agent for enterprise governance that evaluates vendor risk through deterministic, rule-based analysis. We created a synthetic dataset of vendors with financial ratings, security certifications and incident history. The agent processes this data and classifies vendors into specific risk tiers (low, medium or high) while providing justifications for its decisions.\n\nIt also supports interactive follow-ups allowing users to compare vendors or simulate how changing data points would impact a risk score, ensuring the high level of auditability required for corporate compliance.\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This also isn&#x27;t Salesforce&#x27;s first foray into making deals with the US Army, as it previously integrated its technology into the Army Human Resources Command as part of a modernization effort, and into the Army Accessions Information Environment to \&quot;accelerate and optimize recruiting pipelines,\&quot; a move that appears to have already paid off for the branch, as 2025 recruiting numbers skyrocketed after years of declines, though that hasn&#x27;t plugged the hole in high attrition rates.\n\nSalesforce didn&#x27;t immediately respond to questions for this story. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n### Broader topics\n\n#### More about\n\ncomment bubble on white\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n### Broader topics\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news [...] \&quot;This new contract ... will operationalize Missionforce across the Army and DOW, delivering trusted data and seamless interoperability, and supporting the DOW&#x27;s transformation into an agentic enterprise,\&quot; Collins said, referring to the DoD as the Department of War, its unofficial nickname Trump assigned via executive order last year.\n\nAccording to Salesforce, Missionforce will provide a one-stop shop for the Army and DoD to manage personnel from hiring to retirement, merge data sources under one dashboard to enable quicker decision making, streamline workflows, and lay the aforementioned \&quot;agent-ready foundation\&quot; for the Army&#x27;s eventual widespread adoption of agentic AI. [...] It&#x27;s worth pointing out that an agentic AI-powered Army isn&#x27;t something Salesforce dreamed up – the Army itself, and the DoD as a whole, have been looking at adopting AI agents for some time. A report [PDF] from the Army&#x27;s Defense Technical Information Center recommended an agentic AI adoption plan last year, and the Pentagon signed a large deal with Scale AI in March 2025 to bring agentic AI into the planning and operations sphere with help from Anduril and Microsoft.\n\nIn other words, this isn&#x27;t Salesforce hoping to break new ground as much as get a slice of a pie that&#x27;s already being served up.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;90% of US companies say they missed their hiring goals in ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Dive Brief:\n\n Ninety percent of U.S. companies said they missed their hiring goals, with 1 in 3 reporting they missed those goals by a wide margin, according to the fifth annual Hiring Insights Report from recruiting software company GoodTime.\n The independent study, which surveyed more than 500 U.S. talent acquisition leaders at companies with more than 1,000 employees in November 2025, found that recruiters spend 38% of their time scheduling interviews, meaning “scheduling remains the biggest operational tax on hiring,” per the report.\n While 99.8% of TA teams said they either use or plan to use AI agents, the report noted an uptick in “fraudulent” or AI-assisted candidates — making fraud the most anticipated hiring challenge in 2026.\n\n### Dive Insight: [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nThe hiring market is under an “unprecedented strain,” GoodTime researchers said, with 60% of organizations seeing time-to-hire increase in 2025, and only 1 in 9 companies saying they had reduced time-to-hire. Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters. Top-performing TA teams reorganized roles and workflows around AI instead of adding recruiters or relying on top-of-funnel automation, per the report. [...] The result, researchers said, was a hiring process that moved more quickly, surfaced better signals, protected candidate experience and improved quality-of-hire, all without growing their TA teams.\n\nStill, TA leaders said they were “divided on whether hiring conditions will become more or less competitive in 2026,” per the report, which concluded that this sentiment reflects “a fragmented market shaped by role-specific demand and uneven adoption of modern hiring infrastructure.”\n\nAhryun Moon, CEO and co-founder of GoodTime, said in a release that the hiring challenge in 2026 isn’t about adding more people or cutting teams, but rather about redesigning the hiring workflow “so humans keep their focus on judgment, relationships, and the moments that truly require a human touch.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Lee Bo Han:\n\nTargeted upskilling initiatives and national programmes are areas where the government can render assistance. Greater support for hands-on AI governance and training, frameworks for data quality and accuracy across board members and executives could be one measure. Transforming talent, embedding next-generation skills such as digital fluency and sustainability across all levels of the workforce. This includes leadership. Whilst traditional software and generative AI are in the IT space, one follows rules and the other creates. Instead of operating a software, learning to collaborate with generative AI is key. Therefore, it is important for board leadership to also evolve in parallel, to effectively steer and lead a workforce with these new capabilities.

With agentic AI capable of autonomous decision-making, we’re seeing transformative opportunities and challenges that can reshape global competitiveness.\n\nLee Bo Han:\n\nThat’s right, Paul and James. Scaling AI and emerging tech has been and should be a strategic priority for firms, both large and small. It is important for governments and enterprises to embed trust, transparency and resilience into the architecture of technological systems. This will drive long-term scalability and interoperability, better positioning firms for success.&quot;,

Cultural friction, communication gaps and talent flight can stall synergy realization. Traditional methods like surveys and workshops aren’t enough at scale.

These approaches also demand specialized skill sets and extensive human input to validate outputs, undermining the efficiency that modern technology aims to achieve.&quot;,

We expect agentic AI to transform most customer experiences, and we are excited to continue partnering with Rubrik to make that possible.\n\nAccelerate your AI transformation by monitoring, governing and remediating agentic actions with Rubrik Agent Cloud.\n\nCustom Content from WSJ is a unit of The Wall Street Journal Advertising Department.

The rise of generative and agentic AI has created new ways to secure the cloud—and new threats. In this interview, Kavitha Mariappan, chief transformation officer at Rubrik, and Rahul Pathak, vice president of data and AI GTM at AWS, discuss how the two companies are working together to help enterprises strengthen cloud resilience in the age of AI. They explore the challenges of securing data and AI agents as threats move at machine speed, the need for governance and observability in agent operations and how Rubrik’s innovations align with AWS’s broader vision for secure, scalable AI adoption. [...] With generative and agentic AI becoming central to business operations, what are the most significant shifts you’re seeing in how companies think about resilience and recovery in the cloud?\n\nRahul Pathak: We see agentic AI as the natural evolution of generative AI. Customers are looking to apply it to end-to-end business workflows; not just asking questions of data, but also sensing the environment and making decisions. Enterprises have a healthy tension between taking advantage of the reasoning capability of agents and needing reliability, predictability and good governance.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Turning AI Vision Into Enterprise Value - Paid Program&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At its heart are five pillars. We use insight to embed governance from day one. Accelerators speed up deployment. We apply automation with agentic frameworks to optimize the workflow. The approach is pure “Human+” collaboration—combining skilled professionals with AI to amplify outcomes. And our process gives you the flexibility to start small, get those early wins, and then scale rapidly across the enterprise. And, of course, we’re customer zero for this.\n\nCan you share some examples of how customers are using this framework to achieve measurable results? [...] Fernandez: One good example is Textron, a major player in fields like aerospace and defense, with 32,000 employees spread across 23 countries. We worked with them to rethink their workflows, deploying AI-powered chatbots trained on their shared knowledge bases, and they saw a 20% reduction in service desk tickets. That is agentic-led, human-validated work in action.\n\nAnd we worked with the European Space Agency to develop ASK ESA, an AI platform that unifies data, ensures compliance and gives researchers fast, secure access to critical insights. It’s a relatively new initiative, but ASK ESA is already saving engineers a couple of hours a week, and it’s positioning the agency for the next wave of AI-led breakthroughs. [...] There are three things that, if you’re not doing them as an enterprise, you’re already behind: customer service, coding and AI-fueled learning. If you are not using AI as part of your software development process, handling customer service requests with an agentic workflow or having your teams learning differently with AI, you need to start now.&quot;,

It is redefining the future of work by enabling autonomous decision-making and task execution. It provides the opportunity for New Zealand organisations to move beyond traditional automation to intelligent systems that manage complex workflows with minimal human input, freeing people to focus on strategy, innovation, and value.\n\nNew Zealand leaders must balance speed and cost, build workforce trust through reskilling, and manage emerging risks such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical governance. A phased approach to adopting Agentic AI is essential, starting with targeted use cases, learning quickly, and scaling responsibly to realise its full potential.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;7. The next evolution of human resources (HR):Generative AI (GenAI) has already begun reshaping HR processes and functions in mining and metals, but the next horizon - agentic AI - will likely require a rethink of how work is structured, how roles are defined, and how humans and digital agents collaborate. For Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), this is not just a technology challenge but a leadership imperative. By balancing their responsibilities as business owners, workforce leaders, and people stewards, they can harness AI’s potential while keeping humans at the centre. [...] “Our abundant critical mineral supply, once seen primarily as an energy transition enabler, is now at the centre of global national security discussions. Companies are expected to balance powering clean energy with reinforcing defence strategies, all while meeting growing consumer demand.\n\n“Meanwhile, the exponential growth of AI is presenting transformative opportunities to elevate operational resilience and competitiveness by boosting productivity and revolutionising mineral discovery. Off-site, the arrival of agentic AI is forcing a rethink of how workforces should be structured in a world where humans and agents work side by side. [...] 6. AI for operational excellence:AI is rapidly becoming a foundation for operational excellence for mining and metals operations, helping companies realise productivity uplifts while prioritising safety, addressing workforce gaps, safeguarding operations against cyberthreats and more. Companies that deploy AI strategically, rather than tactically, could find themselves better positioned to anticipate risks, protect their people, and seize emerging opportunities.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Working with the payroll company Gusto, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.\n\n“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.” [...] In practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.\n\n### Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer\n\n#### Tickets are live!

At the same time, the smarter deployment of human sales agents has increased sales, upgrades and customer retention rates by about 25%. [...] Large funds are also looking to deploy AI to sharpen their deal processes. Investment teams are adopting AI research agents with advanced reasoning engines to improve deal sourcing, simplify initial briefings and clarify investment theses. Some larger funds are creating virtual investment committee ‘personas’ and AI advisors to simulate committee interactions and conduct scenario analyses. These AI solutions analyse historical data from numerous prior deals—typically at least 50—to create focused investment models, identify key risks and prepare deal teams effectively for investment committee reviews.\n\nValue in motion: PE crosses sector boundaries to create growth [...] While such activities are taking place in several of the larger funds, few have publicly commented on them. One exception is Brookfield, which has detailed how it is selectively deploying AI across its portfolio to improve revenue and profit margins. Two companies in its residential infrastructure portfolio, Enercare and HomeServe, which provide 10.5m residential customers with services such as home plumbing, heating and cooling, and electrical system products, are using AI to automate repair calls—which currently account for about 45% of the 3.6m calls received every year. AI bots are being deployed to perform routine tasks such as scheduling appointments, freeing up human call agents to focus on higher-value customer calls.

This is intensifying portfolio reviews, with divestitures of non-core assets increasingly used to free up capital and prioritise higher-growth or more profitable areas. Beyond the traditional trade-off between organic and inorganic growth, leaders must now decide how aggressively to invest in AI and whether this should be through bespoke generative AI models, agentic AI, or large-scale transformation of core workflows. PwC’s 29th Global CEO Survey highlights that the biggest concern among executives is whether their business transformation is keeping pace with technological change, including AI. Despite AI being top of mind, fewer than one in four companies have built solid foundations for [...] As companies position themselves for the AI arms race, M&amp;A is increasingly focused on acquiring the critical capabilities required to deploy AI at scale. This includes cybersecurity, which has become a prerequisite for scaling AI responsibly and safely, as illustrated by two of the largest technology transactions of 2025: Google’s $30bn acquisition of Wiz and Palo Alto Networks’s $25bn proposed acquisition of CyberArk. Beyond security, companies are also using M&amp;A to build capabilities across data, analytics, platforms and infrastructure, including IBM’s $11bn proposed acquisition of Confluent to create a smart data platform for connecting, processing, and governing data for AI applications and agents; Thermo Fisher Scientific’s $8.9bn proposed acquisition of Clario to enhance clinical&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Digital Platforms: where tax teams can provide strategic value&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We are already seeing this future in action. Cloud computing providers are simplifying AI development through their platforms, allowing businesses of all sizes to create intelligent chatbots, automate tasks, and unlock the power of data analytics. [...] The use of platforms is widespread and impacts many different businesses across geographies and industry sectors, demonstrating its broad application and benefits. From e-Commerce giants to ride-sharing apps, platforms are reshaping how businesses operate and interact with their customers and each other.\n\nSupply chains have evolved from linear sequences to dynamic, digitalised webs, and platforms have played an essential role in transforming how businesses operate and go to market.\n\n#### How GenAI can amplify the power of platforms\n\nThe emergence of Generative AI (GenAI) adds another layer of opportunity, pushing the boundaries of what platforms can achieve. [...] #### Moving forward: embracing digital platforms\n\nDigital platforms are an every-day part of modern business. For tax and legal leaders, this means moving beyond traditional reactive roles. By embracing platform-based models, integrating GenAI applications, and being proactively involved, tax teams are well placed to help businesses unlock value in an increasingly interconnected business environment.\n\nTax teams should engage actively with business, legal, and technology teams to ensure tax implications are understood, addressed, and integrated into every stage of platform development and deployment. This proactive stance will empower your business to unlock unprecedented value and thrive in the increasingly interconnected global environment.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Gen AI fabrics and the data architecture challenge facing AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;by Victoria Gayton\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is no longer an experiment tucked away in innovation labs. Enterprises now push toward production-scale systems that can reason, retrieve and act across vast data estates. The shift exposes the fact that existing data architectures must evolve to meet the demands of today’s AI imperative. Gen AI fabrics are emerging as the connective layer enterprises now need to implement. Fragmented pipelines, brittle governance and cloud-first assumptions now intersect with workloads that demand low latency, locality and trust across environments. [...] “Organizations are no longer just experimenting with AI; they’re increasingly deploying it to drive real business impact,” he said. “As they do that, we hear the same challenge again and again. The success of AI projects is often limited by the ability to unlock the value of enterprise data. Enterprise data has grown to a massive size. It’s increasingly fragmented and distributed and often locked in silos across workloads and locations.”\n\nThis production friction reflects a broader shift in how generative and agentic AI workloads pressure enterprise data infrastructure, according to Rob Strechay, principal analyst at theCUBE Research. As AI systems move closer to operational use, existing data environments are increasingly strained. [...] “AI isn’t just about compute; it’s about the data that feeds it,” he said. “Most vendors would say push everything into a single storage layer, but this … slows things down and locks you in. The real challenge isn’t just storing the data; it’s activating it [and] turning raw information into something that’s usable, trustworthy and scalable for AI.”\n\nAs generative and agentic AI workloads evolve, enterprises are reconsidering how tightly coupled their data platforms need to be. Flexibility becomes as crucial as performance as AI pipelines grow more complex, according to Anahad Dhillon, director of product management at Dell.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We’re very fortunate. Our CEO is very forward-thinking and really sees the power of AI. What I would say for leaders who maybe don’t have that buy in is “keep pushing,” because AI is here and it is guaranteed to stay. \n\nYou have to get the tools in people’s hands. Start small if you need to. Give a subset of people those tools and then really prove out that there is excitement and engagement around that. \n\nI go back to this concept of mindset. This is not deploying a technology tool; this is deploying a whole new way of thinking and working. \n\n#### What are you excited about on the HR front? [...] #### What are you excited about on the HR front?\n\nI don’t want to be repetitive, but everything is all AI. As a leader, I have to come up with a three-year strategic plan of how we’re going to leverage AI in HR. It’s really exciting capitalizing on some of the momentum that’s in our organization but also thinking about how we can reimagine some of the work and think big and think differently. \n\n#### What are you interested in outside of work?\n\nI love music.

[...] #### HR DIVE: How is the role of HR changing?\n\nJOANNE RODGERS: Now is the greatest time to be in HR, because I feel like there is so much going on around transformational work, whether or not that’s related to AI or evolving how organizations operate. HR is really front and center. I’ve seen a shift where we were always a partner, but now we are really driving thought leadership in many spaces. We’re ultimately driving business outcomes. \n\n#### What is your approach to leading change?\n\nWhen you think about any organizational change, it really is about people, and I really think it&#x27;s about preparing them with the mindset, skill set and tool set. \n\n#### Do you have any advice for other organizations on AI adoption?&quot;,

Likewise, a June report from Robert Half found that 93% of hiring managers said the hiring process took longer in 2025 than just two years ago.\n\nThe report from GoodTime outlined what kind of AI use in hiring could be useful to recruiters.

Research from professional services firm Deloitte showed that adopting AI tools had not helped the bottom line at all for most companies. A PwC survey of 4,454 business leaders found that more than half of CEOs indicated they had seen neither increased revenue nor decreased costs from their AI deployments.\n\nMeanwhile, customers are increasingly looking to non-financial benefits from AI, according to Zborowska. [...] For 2026, IDC says it expects to see enterprise spending on AI continue to rise, and that it will become a core part of business performance. The report also says that agentic AI will emerge as the next step in workflow automation, though this needs to be applied with caution. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Enterprise\n International Data Corporation\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about\n\n AI\n Enterprise\n International Data Corporation\n Lenovo\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n AIOps\n DeepSeek\n Gemini\n Google AI\n GPT-3\n GPT-4\n Large Language Model\n Machine Learning\n MCubed\n Neural Networks\n NLP\n Retrieval Augmented Generation\n Rimini Street\n Star Wars\n Tensor Processing Unit\n ThinkPad\n TOPS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Agentic AI is redefining HR and workforce strategies | EY - India&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sure, Pallavi. Agentic AI is having a significant impact on high-potential talent identification process. The high potential talent identification process is shifting from input-based process to a periodic workflow-driven decision-making model. Traditionally, high-potential decisions have come from sources like managerial judgment and performance reviews, or some organizations do point in time assessments. With AI, the lens of collecting data around high-potential talent has become much broader or is becoming much broader. [...] AI is helping organizations collate data from sources like projects, collaboration patterns, leadership behaviors, mobility and how individuals respond to specific stretch or specific assignments that they are put on. The source of data is not limited to people who are very visible, but individuals who are really contributing, agile, who are demonstrating the right kind of collaboration behaviors.  \n    \n In EY we have a platform, an Agentic AI enabled platform called EY Competency Connect to bring behavioral, functional and technical data together to provide deeper insights, enabling organizations to take a high-potential talent decision. That is the shift happening from a point in time to something that happens continuously with the flow of work. [...] Pallavi, it is having an impact across the HR value chain, what we call as workflow execution. If you look at the HR value chain, starting from hiring to onboarding to performance management to learning to exit, Agentic AI is having a very significant impact. Aspects like approvals, policy clarifications, scheduling, consolidating feedback, generating insights about individuals about talent from multiple sources — the usage of Agentic AI is growing by leaps and bounds. The interesting thing happening is that many processes which were dependent on multiple data sources or data lying across multiple systems or decisions which were based on inputs from multiple individuals, AI is simplifying, consolidating and providing an easier body of data that is available for decision making.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Agentic AI is transforming businesses | EY - India&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Many organizations expect advanced solutions such as Agentic AI to address complex processes where traditional automation methods like RPA have fallen short.\n Businesses are moving up from conducting many proofs of concept (POCs) to thinking about unlocking value and driving ROI.\n Enterprises view Agentic AI as a 24/7 digital workforce that can be scaled up or down as per requirements.\n Organizations are evaluating their processes to deploy agents with the aim to reduce time and cost and improving process quality.\n Integration of a human-in-the-loop approach is crucial to provide guidance in some cases and continuously improve AI agents.\n The current challenges with AI agents, such as performance consistency and quality, will likely get resolved over time. [...] The other sort of tenet or idea is there have been situations where people have tried RPA or traditional automation and have been limited in solving problems and there I think the idea of using Agentic AI is becoming interesting because if you take any process that has some level of complexity and where, traditional automation has faced some challenges, like, you know, I could name, pretty large list like invoice processing or claims processing, approving a loan, doing quality control or process, doing root cause analysis, automated resolution of tickets, in an industrial setting, looking at various telemetry information and then coming up with, a conclusion or a decision, in an HR setting, doing a talent assessment or doing KYC or customer support, or in a software development [...] Agentic AI is redefining the landscape of enterprise processes and how organizations view operational efficiency. However, the technology is still in early stages though many of its current challenges are likely to get resolved with increased use and enterprises understanding the mix of autonomy needed. While the definition of Agentic AI is expected to change over time, the idea of agents is enduring.\n\nMost businesses currently see Agentic AI as a digital workforce that can drive multiple processes better than the previous generation of automation technologies. However, more impact would come from taking a comprehensive view of processes and problems, adds Hari.\n\n#### Key takeaways&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI deployment accelerates despite risks: KPMG | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and Workday are among tech giants that began launching agents last year, promising the next stage of enterprise automation.\n\nBig Four accounting firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have quickly jumped on the band wagon as well, offering their own agentic AI solutions for customers.\n\nAmong the enterprises now using agentic AI, many are taking a balanced, strategic approach, according to the results of the KPMG survey.\n\nNearly half of leaders (46%) said they were focused on efficiency and revenue growth as it relates to their AI agent strategies, according to KPMG’s report. Meanwhile, leader concerns about data privacy, regulatory issues and data quality are at their highest in three quarters, the report said. [...] About one-third of organizations have advanced to full-scale deployment of agentic artificial intelligence technology, up three-fold after two consecutive quarters at 11%, according to a KPMG study released Thursday.\n Fifty-seven percent of surveyed organizations are piloting agents, down from 65%, and 10% are exploring the possibility of using them, compared to 25% last quarter, the Big Four accounting firm found.\n “The data shows just how quickly AI agents are moving out of pilots and into production — and that momentum will only accelerate,” Steve Chase, KPMG’s vice chair of AI and digital innovation, said in a press release. “What makes this moment unique is that leaders increasingly see agents not just as a way to cut costs, but as a way to rethink growth and create new value.” [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nThe still nascent technology continues to pose implementation challenges, KPMG said. The primary obstacles to agent deployment include technical skills gaps, workforce resistance to change and system complexity, according to a report on the findings.\n\nGartner predicts that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Evolution of HR - KPMG agentic corporate services&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The HR transformation has been a long time in the making. In recent years, it has been accelerated by workforce trends (e.g. telecommuting and mobile workforces) and generational challenges. It has also incorporated the rapid advancement of automation, cognitive processing and artificial intelligence (AI). The impact of increasing regulatory burdens along with their security, fraud, and risk implications has also been felt. At the same time, HR is being challenged to attract more informed and sophisticated talent who are, in turn, assessing employers on their social, economic, and corporate values. [...] When the good go bad © 2016 KPMG LLP , a Canadian limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. All rights reserved.\n12 The Evolution of HR Welcome to the era of “Digital Labour” , where automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are redefining – and in many cases, replacing – jobs across all industries. Although filled with promise, this technological revolution presents many challenges for HR departments, not the least of which is the need to modify workforce strategies, adopt new systems and processes, refresh recruitment and branding strategies, and manage the potential displacement of labour – all while keeping employee and client privacy in mind. [...] Managing digital labour means taking automation to its next natural step and understanding what that means for the company and staff, including for talent strategies, labour relations, and the leadership who will need to lead and manage these new efficiencies with likely less staff. It’s about HR leading the business through this transition, and that’s going to be exciting and challenging.\nManaging digital labour The advance of machine learning means HR professionals must not only manage current implications, but know where the technology is taking the company.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What Is a Relational Database (RDBMS)? Key Features &amp; ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# What Is a Relational Database (RDBMS)? Key Features and Uses\n\n## What Is a Relational Database?\n\nA relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data in tables that can be linked to each through shared columns and rows, called relations, with unique identifiers (keys) that show the different relationships between tables.\n\nThis relational model is similar to a spreadsheet model in that rows represent the individual records, such as customer, accounts or transactions, while columns represent the attributes of those records, such as customer ID, account number or transaction amount. Using this model, rows in one table can be linked to rows in another table using common keys which establish the relationships between tables. [...] IBM Db2 – A proprietary family of RDBMS systems developed by IBM for high performance, reliability and enterprise-scale data processing. Db2 RDBMS versions run multiple platforms, including Linux, UNIX, Windows, IBM AS/400 and IBM mainframes. It is SQL-based but supports JSON documents, XKL storage, time-series data, columnar storage and Graph capabilities in some versions. It is widely used in finance, government, healthcare and insurance, retail, airline and enterprise IT environments. [...] The rigid, fixed schema of relational databases reduces agility and are not suited for unstructured or semi-structured data and frequently changing record shapes.\n Relational databases are great at vertical scaling, but horizontal scaling is complex.\n Performance may degrade with very large datasets and complex joins, which can slow down distributed workloads.\n Commercial RDBMSs can be expensive, especially at scale.\n OLTP is not meant for complex analytics queries.\n Easy to create data silos, increasing storage costs.\n ETL complexity (in the case of moving data back and forth between operational and analytical stores).\n Handling semi-structured data (Delta, Iceberg, Parquet -- what you find in the lakehouse).\n Difficulty with non-standard data types for ML/AI integration&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The whole concept of agentic AI is the ability to manage across multiple domains,” he said. “It’s like the next future evolution of integration. You need to have that orchestration layer to tie supply chains with financial agents, with HR agents and so forth. We work a lot with the enterprise architecture organizations to make sure that the guardrails are applied so that there’s a trust that there is the ability to validate the truth. This capability that Workato is providing provides that kind of service, based on their experiences of doing integration services.” [...] UPDATED 17:20 EST / AUGUST 22 2025\n\n### Capgemini teams up with Workato to push agentic AI into the enterprise\n\nby  Brian Njuguna\n\nArtificial intelligence is evolving fast with agentic AI taking it further by reasoning, adjusting and adapting in real time to get results.\n\nCapgemini LLC. offers Agentic AI for Enterprise, enabling organizations to embed autonomous AI agents into existing systems with governance, scalability and speed. Powered by Workato Inc.’s low-code/no-code platform, businesses can rapidly build, configure and manage purpose-specific AI agents, according to Al Liubinskas (pictured, left), vice president and NA cloud integration practice lead at Capgemini.\n\nCapgemini’s Al Liubinskas talks with theCUBE about the transformative impact of agentic AI. [...] Liubinskas and David Ng (right), vice president and partner of go to market and Alliances at Workato, spoke with theCUBE’s Savannah Peterson and Rob Strechay at the WOW: World of Workato event, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the importance of agentic AI in the enterprise and how Capgemini and Workato are turning it into reality. (\\ Disclosure below.)\n\n### Agentic AI acts as an intelligent conductor that orchestrates actions\n\nUnlike traditional AI that only generates outputs, agentic AI serves as an orchestration layer — coordinating, sequencing and managing actions across systems, tools and workflows. The Capgemini-Workato partnership is designed to bring this vision to life, according to Liubinskas.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI powers true end-to-end automation by replacing rigid workflows with adaptive, goal-driven orchestration. Unlike traditional automation that follows fixed rules, it acts as a proactive collaborator — sensing, deciding and acting across interconnected systems, Kompella pointed out. \n\n“Everybody wants to talk about agentic AI,” she said. “The technology promise means, first of all, end-to-end process automation experience, end-to-end seamless coordination between organizational processes — people, clients and employees. It’s possible because of the ability of memory, perception, reasoning, learning, which gives the ability to act and be decisive, which was not there in traditional automation technologies before.” [...] Agentic AI solutions elevate human potential by serving as collaborative, goal-driven partners. Rather than executing pre-defined tasks, the agents make decisions, adapt to change and proactively drive outcomes across sectors such as supply chain, warehousing and manufacturing, according to Lim. [...] “In the current world, the human resource, the people are the most important parts,” he said. “The robots and agents are actually strategic enablers to help us deliver the outcomes. With the AI agents in some of the places like warehousing, service supply networks, we have actually reduced the number of hours required from days to actually hours. For example, one of our key business experts was working previously in a warehouse environment performing more of the tasks in the warehouse itself. Now he has moved to become an analyst.”&quot;,

Figure 1: Capgemini research: Turbocharging software with AI **How Capgemini’s AI agents are transforming legacy modernization** At Capgemini, we have developed an innovative approach that takes advantage of agentic AI coding agents to significantly reduce the time needed to modernize legacy applications. Our AI agent tool – a sophisticated multi-agent system – is purpose-built to make legacy systems future-safe. In Capgemini’s AI agent tool, multiple agents collaborate to modernize a legacy application and transition it to a new technology stack. So that the transition runs smoothly, the roles of these AI agents mirror those in a human development team migrating a legacy application (see figure 3). Figure 3: Get the job done – the power of agentic AI agents **An applicable approach across sectors** At Capgemini, we are already using this approach with many clients in the global public sector and beyond. The client could not develop those applications any further but also recognized the need to integrate new features and switch to a modern technology platform. Thanks to our AI agent tool, though, a large part of this previously manual migration could be automated. **Would you like to try Capgemini’s AI agent tool for yourself?** By automating the process, our tool makes it faster and more cost-effective to switch legacy applications over to new and future-safe technologies. ### Sebastian Baumbach “Generative AI and intelligent agents are transforming the way governments modernize applications and deliver digital services.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Capgemini and NVIDIA: Pioneering the future of AI factories with Capgemini RAISE and Agentic Gallery&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Managing AI at scale\n\nCapgemini RAISE is our AI resource management platform, able to manage AI applications and AI agents across multiple environments within a single managed solution. This enables organizations to separate their solution from systemic risk and, leveraging NVIDIA NIM microservices, can centralize AI evaluation, AI FinOps, and model management. The business can then focus on delivering AI-augmented work, while the AI Risk Management team focuses on managing risk, costs, and technical challenges.\n\nThis is a paradigm shift, placing the AI Factory at the center – and not only for private implementation, but as the global point for AI management. [...] “This new collaboration with NVIDIA marks a pivotal step forward in our commitment to bringing cutting-edge AI-powered technology solutions to our clients for accelerated value creation. By leveraging the power of the NVIDIA AI Stack, Capgemini will help clients expedite their agentic AI journey from strategy to full deployment, enabling them to solve complex business challenges and innovate at scale.” – Anne-Laure Thibaud, EVP, Head of AI &amp; Analytics Global Practice, Capgemini\n\n## Benefits for modern enterprises [...] ##### Mark Oost\n\n##### June 11, 2025\n\n## Capgemini and NVIDIA’s strategic collaboration provides an innovative AI solution designed to transform the way enterprises build and scale AI factories.\n\nThis work is aimed to assist organizations, particularly those in regulated industries or with substantial on-premises infrastructure investments, deploy agentic AI into their operations. By leveraging NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, accelerated infrastructure, and the Capgemini RAISE platform, companies can expect a seamless, high-performance AI solution ready for the future.\n\n## Managing AI at scale&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Bulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.Bulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.\nBulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.\n\n## AI Agents Are Coming Fast—But Core Systems Aren’t Ready\n\nThe study shows explosive interest in agentic AI, but deep hesitation around letting these agents act without supervision:\n\nA readiness index in the report shows that:\n\nLeaders aren’t succeeding by experimenting with more agents—they’re succeeding because they’re investing in the foundation that makes agents viable, safe, and predictable.\n\n## The Trust Gap Is an Orchestration Problem\n\nExecutives were clear about what’s holding AI agents back: [...] That’s the headline from new research conducted by Harvard Business Review, in partnership with Workato and AWS. And the findings confirm what many CIOs and CTOs feel every day: organizations are excited about agentic AI, but few believe their foundations are mature enough to let AI agents operate at the core of their business.\n\nA recent Fortune analysisof the study underscores the urgency: only 6% of companies fully trust AI agents to autonomously run core business processes, yet 86% plan to increase their investment in agentic AI over the next two years\n\nThis widening gap between ambition and readiness is the defining challenge of enterprise AI adoption.  \nAnd it’s exactly where enterprise orchestration and the Enterprise MCP come in. [...] Executives were clear about what’s holding AI agents back:\n\nThese aren’t “AI” problems. They’re enterprise architecture problems.\n\nThe study points to a solution many organizations are already pursuing:  \nEnterprise Orchestration.\n\nMore than 74% of organizations are working on or planning to implement enterprise orchestration to prepare for agentic AI—because orchestration provides the connective tissue agents need to safely operate across systems, data, and workflows.\n\nThis is why the foundation of Enterprise MCP is so important. It’s a governed, secure, AI-ready orchestration layer that turns systems, data, and processes into consumable services agents can safely use.\n\n## Download the Full Harvard Business Review Report&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Click to increase view\n\n Activate to open full-size image in lightbox overlay\n\nThe focus on automation, AI and digital spend shows that the pivot to AI is already underway, with the center of gravity shifting from on-demand content generation to autonomy and orchestration directly serving business goals, or as we call it: agentification of processes.\n\n## What is agentic AI, and why the hype?\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent software that autonomously makes decisions and acts upon it to achieve defined goals without continuous human input. It operates around the clock, learns from its environment, and adapts as conditions change. In HR, its power lies in how it combines three complementary capability levers:\n\n 1 [...] In recruiting, for instance, AI agents can plan searches, screen CVs, score candidates, schedule interviews, validate skills and draft recommendations for candidate selections, adapting shortlists based on recruiter feedback and continuously optimizing alignment with company goals and recruiter feedback. The shift is less about a setting up a single “super agent”, and more about carefully scaled individual agents for HR key areas that keep humans in the loop where judgment and context matters (e.g., talent sourcing, L&amp;D, HR ticket resolution).\n\nBecause it unites autonomy, learning, and orchestration, agentic AI can already support more than 70% of HR processes. The gains vary by process: some primarily deliver FTE reduction, others improve service quality, and some unlock both. [...] 1\n\n  Transactional automation accelerates repetitive, rule-based tasks to reduce errors and cost\n 2\n\n  Strategic augmentation supports human decisions with real-time insights for better strategy and planning\n 3\n\n  Central orchestration coordinates complex workflows across systems for real-time, end-to-end execution\n\nTraditional generative tools excel at creating content from prompts but remain reactive. Agentic AI builds on these capabilities by adding goal-directed reasoning, persistent memory, and the ability to plan and execute actions within defined guardrails. In practice, this transforms static outputs into dynamic workflows that continuously learn from human feedback.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The back end is full of labor-intensive, rules-governed tasks in which staffing constraints are the primary gatekeepers to 100 percent completion of work. This circumstance is ideal for agentic AI. Functions such as accounts receivable follow-up, underpayment management, denials management, and cash posting are time-consuming, but they follow clear patterns that AI can learn and replicate (at least in part) by allowing human operators to manage exceptions. Automating these tasks can reduce labor hours while increasing the volume of claims worked with a high degree of fidelity. By taking on these high-volume workflows of varying complexities, agentic AI can free staff up to focus on more-strategic activities, spurring efficiency and productivity across the organization. [...] ### Invest in change management and people\n\nThe shift to agentic AI is as much about people as it is about technology. Staff may wonder how their roles will change, making it essential to communicate that agentic AI augments the workforce. As AI agents take on day-to-day tasks, human responsibilities will shift toward training the agents, interpreting complex outputs, handling exceptions, and enabling the delivery of patient-centered care. [...] Now, health systems are turning to AI for help. The latest AI iteration, agentic AI, is unlocking the first credible path to a truly tech-enabled and well run revenue cycle. Agentic AI represents a significant evolution in AI, characterized by its ability to autonomously make decisions and execute complex end-to-end processes, unlike gen AI, which primarily provides advisory support. In effect, it can function more like a coworker than a tool.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI agent could proactively communicate with clients. This group also deals with cross-border pricing and commercial management, with AI agents adapting offers and strategies to local market conditions, tax structures, and regulatory differences. This is especially relevant for international fleets and multinational clients. [...] ## Balancing opportunity, costs, and risks\n\nImplementing AI agents comes with associated costs, including retraining models, data labeling, and cloud consumption. Organizations must carefully evaluate these costs and prioritize the most valuable problems to solve to ensure a positive return on investment.\n\nFinally, organizations must address the risks associated with AI, particularly in credit-related contexts. Compliance with regulations such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the United States and the EU AI Act is critical. Robust risk management, data governance, transparency, and human oversight are essential to ensure compliance and build trust. [...] ## AI-driven agents as a solution\n\nAI agents are specialized systems that combine advanced ML algorithms for decision-making with gen AI for communication and interaction. These agents can aid in both internal and external-facing processes across the organization, achieving new efficiencies by leveraging existing and new sources of data. However, not every problem requires an agentic solution—traditional ML models or AI may be more appropriate for certain use cases.\n\nWe suggest that organizations interested in creating a vision for an AI-driven enterprise start by considering building and integrating four groups of agents: a remarketing group, a service and operations group, a sales and pricing group, and a procurement and end-to-end value maximization group (Exhibit 1).\n\nExhibit 1&quot;,

Accelerating agentic AI deployment at a top pharmaceutical company. # Accelerating agentic AI deployment at a top pharmaceutical company. How we accelerated agentic AI POCs for specific domains to prepare for enterprise-wide transformation. McKinsey leveraged agentic AI to enhance productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction across sales and service divisions to scale for organizational transformation. ### The challenge. The client faced inefficiencies in market access operations due to manual processes, siloed data, and decentralized insight. The market access operations team had deployed limited AI use cases compared to other commercial sub-domains. The client identified AI agents as enablers to empower teams to focus on higher-value work and handle increased workloads. Accelerating agentic AI deployment at a top pharmaceutical company. ### The solution. Collaborating with Microsoft, McKinsey helped the client quickly develop agentic AI POCs to streamline market access operations. McKinsey also conducted an art of the possible gen AI/agentic AI workshop with clients to identify 14 core use cases to address. Based on this, the team developed a 12- to 18-month phased deployment approach based on priority use cases, starting with building and testing POCs to accelerate output. The effort then progressed to a 6-month MVP build of targeted areas to expand knowledge and conduct a “big bang” style launch. ### The result. McKinsey and Microsoft successfully deployed a Microsoft Copilot solution to deliver insights and support Commercial Sales in pre-call planning, which resulted in a 1–2 percent revenue increase. McKinsey also developed an integrated AI-enabled platform to review and correct Commercial Marketing content that led to a 5–20 percent reduction in content costs and streamline time to launch to 1–2 weeks.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Reimagining banking in Asia through agentic AI | McKinsey. AI in Asia: Reimagining banking operations through agentic AI. # AI in Asia: Reimagining banking operations through agentic AI. Multiagentic systems are transforming operations, combining the power of technology, processes, and people to deliver outsized impact for banks in Asia. **Agentic AI is expected to have a transformative impact** on banking operations over the next decade, and many banking leaders are now seeking clarity on how AI and agentic AI can be harnessed in operations to optimize workflows, delight customers, cut costs, and increase productivity. This report is a collaborative effort by Abhilash Sridharan, Azam Mohammad, David Deninzon, Jan Henrich, Martin Rosendahl, Renny Thomas, Senthil Muthiah, Vinayak HV, and Violet Chung, with Hannes Bergström, Mint Namasondhi, Paras Chhabra, Rasika Ramesh, and Yuvika Motwani, representing views from McKinsey’s Operations Practice. Unlike previous technology waves, however, success with agentic AI and multiagentic systems will require an organization-level mindset shift and a fundamental rewiring of the way work gets done, and by whom.1*Seizing the agentic AI advantage*, QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, June 13, 2025. McKinsey research highlights ten key domains within banking operations that offer significant opportunity for reimagination, especially when approached holistically and through a fleet of nine enhanced agentic AI ‘operations transformers’ (Exhibit 1). Against a backdrop of rising customer expectations and a challenging operating environment, three drivers help illustrate AI’s potential in banking operations:. **AI is expected to disrupt the operations function more than any other lever.** With end-to-end operations representing an estimated 60 to 70 percent of a bank’s cost base, based on McKinsey’s research and engagements, transforming operational processes could be an unprecedented value unlock in the financial services sector. Banks today have an immediate opportunity to harness agentic AI to fundamentally transform their operations. Ultimately, any undertaking to reimagine banking operations through AI is not simply a technology program; it is a strategic reinvention and rewiring of workflows. With endless AI-related opportunities to consider, such an approach could help banks remain focused on value and position themselves to capture the full promise of AI-driven operational excellence.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## How will agentic AI impact the workforce?\n\n Productivity increases.People become AI supervisors rather than task executors.\n Roles shift.Agents democratize technical skills, increasing the breadth of employee roles.\n Decision making is redefined.Employee autonomy increases and decision cycles speed up.\n Collaboration becomes critical.Agents expedite work, but it remains important to coordinate interactions among people.\n Risk management expands.AI agents increase risk of unintended consequences, requiring new guardrails.\n\n## What should businesses do to prepare for agentic AI? [...] ## What barriers are hindering the adoption of agentic AI?\n\n Generalization beyond narrow scopes: AI agents perform well in tightly defined workflows, less so in complex contexts.\n Explanation of decisions: Agents are often “black boxes,” making it hard to validate decisions or fix errors.\n Workflow training:If workflows are undocumented, agents are limited to information at hand to operate independently.\n Cooperation among agents: Agents struggle to operate together without mature orchestration, architectures, and coordination.\n Data and tooling: Agents cannot act without access to clean data and integrated tooling.\n\n## How will agentic AI impact the workforce? [...] ## What should businesses do to prepare for agentic AI?\n\n Embed agents where ROI is greatest. Identify where vendor ecosystems, agentic AI technology, and your business intersect.\n Pilot fast, iterate faster. The agentic phase is moving faster than previous AI waves; test and iterate faster.\n Prepare data and tools. Set up agents for success so they can be rapidly adopted by your employees.\n Be wary of standalone platforms.Pressure test agents’ connectors to other systems.\n Become a learning organization. Encourage experimentation and foster a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nPublished in January 2025\n\n###### Tags&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Generative AI can make HR more ‘human,’ not less—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;BOSTON - November 19, 2024 -The transformative impact of generative AI on the HR profession could lead to a more human touch, in addition to lower costs, according to a new study by global consultancy Bain &amp; Company.\n\nThe study suggests that selecting the right roles for automation and AI interventions could, on average, save around 15-20% in HR labor time. According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer tool, HR business partners could save up to 15% of employee time through AI; talent acquisition teams can save up to 20%; and HR operations teams up to 35%. [...] “HR is at a critical juncture. The function is under pressure to become both more cost efficient and more strategic. That is a challenging balance to strike,” said John Hazan, a partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of the firm’s Talent solution. “Generative AI has the power to elevate HR’s role in the organization, from transactional operators to strategic advisers. Our analysis suggests a typical company could save, on average, up to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and augmentation.” [...] According to Bain, HR leaders will be able to reinvent their teams’ structure and skills once transactional processes are streamlined through technology. In so doing, specialist HR advisers will become innovation hubs; HR business partners will become advisers to the business and designers of workplace culture; and operational teams will become analysts.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI poised to disrupt retail, even with 50% of consumers cautious of fully autonomous purchases—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI, which combines memory, reasoning, and tool use to act semi- or fully autonomously across the shopping journey, is ready to emerge as a retail disrupter. AI now accounts for up to 25% of referral traffic for some retailers, though it is still less than 1% of total traffic, according to Bain’s research in partnership with Similarweb. Of the three types of AI agents – third-party “objective” agents (e.g. ChatGPT, Perplexity), on-site retailer agents, and off-site retailer agents – third-party agents threaten to disintermediate retailers most. Consumers currently trust retailers’ on-site agents three times more, though the trust gap could close as more consumers try utilizing third-party agents. [...] “Agentic AI marks a major shift in retail discovery and loyalty since the rise of search engines,” said Aaron Cheris, partner in Bain’s Retail practice. “These systems are beginning to act independently across the shopping journey, from product research to checkout, creating both disruption and opportunity for retailers. This is the moment to strengthen customer relationships, build trust, and make retailer-value obvious —to humans and to algorithms alike.”\n\nWinning retailers will strategically decide how to participate in the Agentic AI emergence by either building their own agentic capabilities, or by strategically collaborating with major AI platforms, finds Bain. Agility will be crucial as the rules of engagement evolve. [...] NEW YORK—November 13, 2025—Agentic AI is poised to reshape the way consumers shop online, making agentic commerce strategies critical for retailers, Bain &amp; Company finds in a new report Agentic AI in Retail: How Autonomous Shopping Is Redefining the Customer Journey. But while shoppers increasingly use Generative AI, around half still say they are cautious about letting AI agents autonomously handle purchases from start to finish.&quot;,

Agentic AI is closer than most realize, poised to become part of our everyday once consumer trust and infrastructure click into place.\n\nBain estimates that the US agentic commerce market could reach $300 to $500 billion by 2030, making up roughly 15% to 25% of overall e-commerce. We define agentic commerce as purchases that are initiated, influenced, or completed by third-party AI agents or retailer-hosted agents, excluding shopping journeys that only use AI-assisted search or discovery.

The idea of taking a fully autonomous taxi around LA sounded like science fiction. The story, though, is familiar: Once far-fetched behaviors become routine, seemingly overnight. [...] The bottom line for retailers and brands: By 2030, AI will touch most online shopping in some capacity, completing up to a quarter of transactions.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Hands on with agentic AI: AI masterclass in São Paulo | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## What topics does Bain’s AI Masterclass cover?\n\nEach Bain AI Masterclass spotlights a trending topic in generative AI. This session focused on Agentic AI—systems where multiple “agents” collaborate to solve complex problems. We explored how this approach can accelerate client impact and streamline internal operations.\n\nThe São Paulo event began with a discussion on why Agentic AI matters in the market, exploring how it can make operations more efficient, create opportunities for new products, and reshape core business processes.\n\nThe group moved into a technical discussion before turning to two illustrative business cases based on real client work that showed the concepts in practice: [...] “I have a background in GenAI, especially with LangChain, a popular AI framework, and LangGraph, a newer extension that helps structure workflows, which are flexible but sometimes unstructured. When Bain shared their solution using Crew AI, a framework that structures collaboration among AI agents, I simply fell in love. The catchy point is that Crew AI doesn’t have a solution for human in the loop, so they embedded a LangGraph node inside Crew AI. Mixing two frameworks like that is, for me, a genius action.”\n\nEven if you haven’t worked with these frameworks before, you’ll come away with a clear sense of how Bain applies the latest generative AI in practical and creative ways.\n\n## Why is the Bain AI Masterclass valuable for recruits? [...] “I was worried that Bain might not live up to the expectations I had built during the recruiting process, and that the reality could feel very different from what I imagined. But the moment I stepped into the event, I felt at home. A recruiter promptly greeted me and introduced me to the people I would be working with, so the weird feeling of ‘how to start talking to people’ simply didn’t exist.”\n\nFor many attendees, the Masterclass is the first time inside Bain’s São Paulo office. It’s a chance to experience Bain’s culture and build personal connections with the people who make up our tech and AI community.\n\n## What topics does Bain’s AI Masterclass cover?&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI Commerce Hinges on Consumer Trust | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Figure 3\n\nAgentic AI will soon play a central role in how people shop and pay, shifting purchase behavior and potentially shifting payment profit pools. To compete in that future, financial institutions must lead with trust. That means designing experiences that are transparent, convenient, and under the consumer’s control.\n\nPublished in July 2025\n\n###### Tags [...] Decide on your role in the emerging ecosystem. Determine whether to build a proprietary agentic AI customer experience or only to be discoverable by external agents in the emerging AI ecosystem. If both, define which proprietary data and assets will remain closed to the broader ecosystem. [...] “Rebook my flight with a change fee of under $150.”\n\nPrompts like these are becoming possible for consumers as they direct AI assistants not just to search but also to make purchases on their behalf.\n\nA significant development came in 2024, when Perplexity integrated shopping features into its search results, enabling one-click purchases. By early 2025, Visa and Mastercard had joined the fray with the likes of OpenAI and Skyfire to accelerate the shift to AI-enabled and agentic payments. Equipped with integrated payment options, security, and spending limits, AI assistants will soon be able to autonomously handle product search, discovery, and purchasing decisions based on consumers’ instructions.&quot;,
