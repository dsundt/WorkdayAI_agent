<li><strong>Phenom Acquires Included to Expand Agentic People Analytics Capabilities (Published 2026-01-14)</strong><br>
<p>Phenom’s acquisition of Included marks a strategic enhancement in its agentic people analytics, empowering its platform’s AI-driven ability to personalize and automate HR functions. With Included’s expertise in DE&I analytics, Phenom can now deliver more autonomous and tailored interventions—supporting evolving organizational needs such as diverse talent engagement, employee sentiment analysis, and unbiased decision recommendations. This reflects a broader industry trend: agentic AI is rapidly becoming foundational in workforce optimization and talent strategy across the HCM sector. For <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/14/phenom-acquires-included-expand-agentic-people-analytics-capabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday clients and Deloitte</a>, this move elevates expectations for AI-powered, inclusion-focused analytics, calling for accelerated innovation, ongoing partner vigilance, and tighter integration of Workday’s analytics offerings.</p></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Named a Leader in IDC MarketScape for Unified AI Governance Platforms (Published 2026-01-14)</strong><br>
<p>IDC’s recent designation of Microsoft’s unified AI governance as a category leader signals a maturing landscape for enterprise AI safety, compliance, and transparency. Microsoft’s platform integrates policy, data protection, and agentic AI oversight, addressing regulatory and corporate risk concerns head-on. The announcement not only differentiates Microsoft technologically but also places pressure on platforms like Workday, SAP, and Oracle to empower customers with robust governance covering their growing agentic AI feature sets. For <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/14/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-unified-ai-governance-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte and Workday</a>, it is critical to demonstrate parallel capabilities in AI governance and support clients with clear frameworks for responsible AI deployment.</p></li>
<li><strong>SAP and Syngenta Announce AI Partnership to Scale HCM and ERP AI Innovation (Published 2026-01-15)</strong><br>
<p>SAP has entered a strategic partnership with Syngenta to co-develop AI-driven enhancements for its HCM and ERP products, with a particular focus on sector-specific innovation and industry-relevant automation. This illustrates the acceleration of co-innovation delivery models, whereby large customers are instrumental in defining AI roadmaps and pilots. In turn, it challenges Workday and integrators like Deloitte to drive similar sector-tailored initiatives, leveraging Workday Extend, open APIs, and robust prototyping methods for client-defined AI use cases. Detailed partnership info can be found on <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601150300BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260115_BW682130-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FT.com</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phenom</strong>: Acquisition of Included further merges sophisticated agentic analytics with core HCM capabilities, particularly around inclusion and personalization. <br><em>Implication:</em> Workday, SAP, UKG, and Oracle must accelerate their own agentic analytics capabilities and prove extensibility and depth in managing workforce diversity and experience. <br></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: MarketScape Leader in AI governance sets a new benchmark for risk, compliance, and transparency across enterprise platforms. <br><em>Implication:</em> All SaaS HCM/finance vendors should review their governance roadmap in light of rising buyer expectations and prepare for cross-platform governance integrations. <br></li>
<li><strong>SAP</strong>: Partnership with Syngenta illustrates co-innovation as a beacon for sector-driven AI deployment.<br><em>Implication:</em> Workday and Deloitte must amplify their sector use-case libraries and highlight Workday’s open ecosystem strengths when pitching to large enterprises. <br></li>

These carry high potential impact for Workday’s clients and ecosystem partners, emphasizing the urgency for strategic alignment and client enablement around agentic capabilities and responsible AI governance.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Phenom Acquires Included to Expand Agentic People Analytics Capabilities (Published 2026-01-14)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Phenom’s acquisition of Included marks a strategic enhancement in its agentic people analytics offerings, strengthening its platform’s AI-driven ability to personalize and automate HR functions. The announcement demonstrates the continuing maturation of agentic AI in the HR technology sector, as Phenom incorporates Included’s diverse, inclusive analytics into its suite, broadening the appeal and effectiveness of its products for enterprise clients. Technically, this move signals a shift towards richer, more autonomous analytics—enabling HR departments to surface insights and interventions asynchronously and with less human mediation. \\n\\nCompetitively, this raises the bar for the entire ecosystem, with a direct challenge to Workday, SAP, UKG, and Oracle to accelerate their own agentic analytics initiatives, especially in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) and personalized employee experiences. For Workday clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice, the deal emphasizes the need to proactively showcase Workday’s progress in agentic AI and to articulate value beyond core HCM workflows. Integrators must double down on partner evaluations, ensure clients understand the evolving landscape, and drive adoption of Workday’s native and partner-enabled analytics for talent and workforce inclusion. \\n\\nSee full coverage: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/14/phenom-acquires-included-expand-agentic-people-analytics-capabilities\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/14/phenom-acquires-included-expand-agentic-people-analytics-capabilities\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft Named a Leader in IDC MarketScape for Unified AI Governance Platforms (Published 2026-01-14)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IDC has recognized Microsoft as a leader in its MarketScape report for unified AI governance, acknowledging Microsoft’s capabilities in governing AI and autonomous systems at scale. Strategic advances such as integrations with security, compliance, data protection, and agentic AI monitoring features distinguish Microsoft’s offer in the governance space. The announcement highlights industry-wide urgency on responsible AI implementation—not just as an ethical imperative, but as a technical and operational differentiator.\\n\\nFor Workday and its customers, this elevates expectations for vendor ecosystems: HR, payroll, and financial platforms must address AI governance natively or through partnerships to reassure enterprise buyers, mitigate risk, and adhere to regulatory trajectories. Deloitte teams supporting Workday implementations should counsel clients on parallel governance efforts (gap assessments, audits, API-level controls), especially as agentic and generative AI features proliferate. Microsoft’s leadership will drive co-opetition and may stimulate enhanced integrations between Workday and Microsoft compliance toolsets.\\n\\nSee full coverage: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/14/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-unified-ai-governance-platforms\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/14/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-unified-ai-governance-platforms\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP and Syngenta Announce AI Partnership to Scale HCM and ERP AI Innovation (Published 2026-01-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP and Syngenta have jointly announced a partnership focused on applying advanced AI in HCM and ERP solutions to transform business processes and workforce management at scale. This initiative immediately intensifies the innovation race in the HCM SaaS space—with implications for both functional roadmap acceleration (AI-driven recruiting, skills mapping, predictive analytics) and the way ecosystem partnerships shape HCM/ERP architectures. \\n\\nFor Workday, the SAP–Syngenta alliance underscores the importance of active partnerships with enterprise clients to co-innovate and deliver industry-specific AI outcomes. This could put pressure on Workday’s extend and skills cloud ecosystem to accelerate delivery of heavily client-tailored, AI-rich solutions, with an eye on sector-specific value propositions. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this is a signal to deepen sector-based solutioning, invest in client-specific AI prototyping, and position Workday’s open ecosystem as a differentiator in co-innovation and speed of deployment.\\n\\nSee announcement details: https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601150300BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260115_BW682130-1\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601150300BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260115_BW682130-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Phenom\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Acquisition of Included to strengthen agentic people analytics and inclusion-focused automation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This move reinforces a trend of blurring lines between core HCM systems and specialized agentic analytics providers, pushing the boundaries for everyone in the HRIS space—including Workday, SAP, and Oracle—to expand solution depth and include sophisticated, self-directed analytics tailored for DE&amp;I and personalized workforce management.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Since the “ChatGPT moment” of late 2022, the tech industry has been treating it as an inevitability that generative AI will transform every aspect of business, and to some degree society. As technologists around the world digested the capabilities of large language models, they began hypothesizing how LLM’s could be combined with data and software functions to provide revolutionary process automation and human augmentation to drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity in every industry. The vehicle for this value would be an exploding population of “AI agents” that would perform tasks autonomously or in support of human workers. Thus began the age of “agentic AI.” [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Revolutionizing manufacturing: The role of Microsoft Copilots and agentic AI | CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Recent advances in generative AI are transforming manufacturing through intelligent assistants and autonomous systems. These technologies address key industry challenges including worker retention, productivity, and operational efficiency through two key approaches: AI Copilots and agentic AI.\n\n## The role of Microsoft Copilots\n\nCopilots represent some of the most impactful solutions built on generative AI, benefiting both businesses and individuals. Designed with specific personas at the center, Copilots reimagine daily workflows by integrating generative AI capabilities. They provide essential knowledge and guidance for day-to-day activities while eliminating manual, repetitive tasks. [...] ## The role of agentic AI\n\nWhile Copilot focuses on supporting specific personas, agentic AI builds autonomous systems designed to achieve specific goals within larger, complex problems.\n\nA multi-agent approach is particularly valuable in dynamic manufacturing environments where continuous optimization and autonomy are essential. For instance, in order fulfillment, separate AI agents can be developed with distinct goals for inventory optimization, order prioritization, production scheduling, adaptive shipping, and end-to-end tracking.\n\nThese agents can autonomously make decisions based on changing environmental conditions while continuously learning from past experiences. Agentic AI has the potential to transform manufacturing from basic automation to true operational autonomy. [...] Manufacturing companies commonly struggle with retaining skilled workers and improving productivity. Each role in the manufacturing value chain can benefit from specialized copilots, including product designers, plant operators, maintenance engineers, supply chain analysts, and sales and service representatives.\n\nFor example, Copilot for plant operators could:\n\nSimilarly, Copilots for maintenance engineers could:\n\nThese capabilities are delivered through natural language interaction in the user’s preferred language and medium.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As many of the world’s largest employers prepare to meet in Davos to discuss how AI is transforming work, Mercer’s signature talent trends survey, of nearly 12,000 business executives, HR leaders, investors, and employees worldwide, now in its 11th year, highlights the strategies to achieve sustainable success through human-AI teaming.\n\n\&quot;In the race to adopt AI, organizations that cling to outdated work models risk falling behind, as many are merely substituting old approaches with technology rather than transforming how work is done,\&quot; said Pat Tomlinson, Mercer’s President and CEO. \&quot;True value comes from reinventing work itself—deconstructing, redeploying, and reconstructing it to optimize human-AI collaboration and create meaningful long-term gains.\&quot; [...] Moreover, despite recognizing the value of human-AI collaboration, only about one-third of C-suite leaders feel their workforce is currently equipped to effectively combine these capabilities.\n\n## Addressing AI anxiety is key to success\n\nEmployee concern about job loss due to AI has surged from 28% in 2024 to 40% in 2026. Anxiety will impede value creation and productivity unless leaders address it. Mercer’s research shows that 62% of employees feel leaders underestimate AI’s emotional and psychological impact, yet only 19% of HR leaders consider these impacts as part of their digital implementation strategy.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Transform AI development with new Amazon SageMaker AI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The new serverless model customization capability in Amazon SageMaker AI transforms what has traditionally been a months-long process into a matter of days. For AI developers who want the highest level of abstraction, we’re introducing an AI agent-guided workflow (in preview) that makes advanced model customization accessible through natural language.\n\nInstead of requiring deep expertise in reinforcement learning techniques, you can now describe your business objectives in plain language. The AI agent engages in a multiturn conversation to understand your use case, then generates a comprehensive specification that includes dataset guidelines, evaluation criteria, associated metrics, and a recommended model that your team can implement without needing specialized knowledge. [...] ## Accelerating AI innovation at every level\n\nThese announcements represent more than individual feature improvements—they establish a comprehensive system for AI model development that meets builders wherever they are on their journey. From natural language–guided customization to self-directed workflows, from intelligent resource management to fault-tolerant training, from experiment tracking to production deployment, Amazon SageMaker AI provides the complete toolkit for transforming AI ideas into production reality.\n\n## Getting started [...] The AI agentic workflow supports supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Models can use these reinforcement learning capabilities to learn from human preferences and verifiable outcomes, creating AI that aligns more closely with your business objectives. You can also generate synthetic data when real-world data is limited, analyze data quality, and handle training and evaluation for accuracy and responsible AI controls. This approach is entirely serverless to remove infrastructure complexity.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;New Work, New World 2026: How AI is Reshaping Work&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Decision-making roles. Managerial and supervisor jobs are now increasingly exposed due to the emergence of agentic AI. Previously, these roles were more insulated from disruption because they involve complex coordination and judgment. Agentic AI alters this dynamic by moving beyond analysis to execution.  \n     \n   Where managers once spent significant time allocating resources, monitoring project status or triaging workflows, autonomous agents can now orchestrate these duties. Project managers, for example, could rely on agents to autonomously schedule meetings, reallocate budget based on spend patterns and chase status updates by leveraging tools they are integrated with. [...] For example, multiple marketing agents can plan a campaign, query databases for segmentation, create advertising assets, schedule social media posts and report performance, all through connected tools.  \n   \n This agentic capability has pulled many administrative and coordination tasks further into the high exposure score zone. Schedulers, office administrators and project assistants once saw limited exposure because AI could not manipulate enterprise software directly. Now, the boundary between “knowledge work” and “process work” is fading as systems handle execution as well as instruction.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Z.ai&#x27;s open source GLM-Image beats Google&#x27;s Nano ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;1. The Auto-Regressive Generator (The \&quot;Architect\&quot;): Initialized from Z.ai’s GLM-4-9B language model, this 9-billion parameter module processes the prompt logically. It doesn&#x27;t generate pixels; instead, it outputs \&quot;visual tokens\&quot;—specifically semantic-VQ tokens. These tokens act as a compressed blueprint of the image, locking in the layout, text placement, and object relationships before a single pixel is drawn. This leverages the reasoning power of an LLM, allowing the model to \&quot;understand\&quot; complex instructions (e.g., \&quot;A four-panel tutorial\&quot;) in a way diffusion noise predictors cannot. [...] As the number of text regions grows, Nano Banana&#x27;s accuracy remains in the 70s, whereas GLM-Image maintains &gt;90% accuracy even with multiple distinct text elements.\n\nFor enterprise use cases—where a marketing slide needs a title, three bullet points, and a caption simultaneously—this reliability is the difference between a production-ready asset and a hallucination.\n\nUnfortunately, my own usage of a demo inference of GLM-Image on Hugging Face proved to be less reliable than the benchmarks might suggest. [...] 2. The Diffusion Decoder (The \&quot;Painter\&quot;): Once the layout is locked by the AR module, a 7-billion parameter Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder takes over. Based on the CogView4 architecture, this module fills in the high-frequency details—texture, lighting, and style.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Hospitality: AI-Driven Industry Trends&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market. [...] Here are six imperatives that we believe can help hospitality providers stand out and win:\n\n#### 1. Capture demand through portfolio innovation and diversification\n\nHospitality companies should rethink how value will be delivered to—and perceived by—future travel personas. This includes adapting to shifting demographics, deepening engagement with emerging audiences, and adjusting to digital expectations.\n\n#### 2. Activate AI-driven travel experiences\n\nFrom travel discovery to onsite interactions to post-stay engagement, AI presents an opportunity to rewire the travel experience to be more intuitive, immersive, and rewarding.\n\n#### 3. Unlock new growth markets [...] #### 3. Unlock new growth markets\n\nHospitality companies should prioritize market expansion strategies that take advantage of demographic and socioeconomic trends, new travel patterns, and brand amplification.\n\n#### 4. Achieve breakthrough efficiency by becoming a predictive enterprise\n\nHospitality companies should consider accelerating AI adoption to automate tasks, enable employees to enhance the customer experience, and respond to shifting guest needs. From the back office to the guest suite, automation and prediction are becoming essential tools to enhance profitability and guest satisfaction.\n\n#### 5. Operate responsibly—it’s a core value\n\nConsumers, regulators, and investors expect hospitality businesses to operate transparently, legally, ethically, and with integrity.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;PostgreSQL Database: Features, Benefits &amp; When to Use It&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Both systems are capable and widely deployed relational databases. The right choice depends on specific requirements, team experience and query complexity. The postgresql community and MySQL community both provide extensive resources for their respective platforms.\n\n### Is Postgres a Free Database?\n\nPostgreSQL is completely free under an open source license. The license allows anyone to use, copy, modify and distribute the software for any purpose without payment. Organizations embed PostgreSQL in commercial products, run it in SaaS platforms and deploy it internally without obligations.\n\nUnlike systems with restricted \&quot;community\&quot; editions, PostgreSQL provides every feature to everyone. No \&quot;enterprise\&quot; edition exists. No postgresql features require payment to unlock. [...] High availability configurations provide automatic failover when servers fail. Point-in-time recovery restores information to any previous moment, meeting strict recovery requirements. The postgresql project has proven its enterprise readiness through decades of production deployment across the postgresql community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPostgreSQL offers a rare combination: advanced capabilities, strict compliance and zero fees. This advanced open source database and relational database management system handles use cases from simple web applications to global-scale platforms, from transaction processing to geographic analysis to AI-powered applications. [...] These commercial systems integrate more tightly with specific vendor tools such as Power BI, Visual Studio and cloud services. Organizations deeply invested in specific technologies may find these integrations valuable despite higher costs.\n\nPostgreSQL offers more indexing options and typically handles concurrent access with less locking. Commercial alternatives include built-in business intelligence features that PostgreSQL addresses through separate tools.\n\nFor organizations evaluating migrations between systems, tools exist to convert schemas and transfer information. The postgresql community provides migration guidance and utilities.\n\n### Can PostgreSQL Handle Enterprise Workloads?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Understanding Change Data Capture: Foundations and Business Value\n\n## What is Change Data Capture?\n\nChange Data Capture (CDC) is a data integration technique that identifies and records row-level changes made to a dataset, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. Instead of repeatedly extracting entire tables, CDC captures only the modified records and applies them to downstream systems. This incremental approach keeps analytics platforms, operational applications and machine learning pipelines aligned with current information without the cost or delay of full refreshes. [...] ### CDC vs. SCD: Understanding the Relationship\n\nCDC and SCD serve different roles within a data pipeline. CDC is responsible for detecting and extracting row-level changes from a source system, while SCD determines how those changes are stored in the target system.\n\nWhen CDC identifies a change, such as a customer updating their address, SCD Type 1 overwrites the existing record because historical values are not needed. SCD Type 2 instead creates a new versioned record with start and end timestamps to preserve the full history. In other words, CDC supplies the incremental change events; SCD applies the rules that shape how those events are represented, either as current-state snapshots or historical timelines. [...] What is the CDC process in ETL?\n\nCDC is the mechanism that identifies and delivers only the rows that have changed since the last extraction. Instead of scanning or reloading entire tables, CDC captures inserts, updates, and deletes directly from the source system and sends them downstream as incremental events. This allows the transformation and loading stages to run continuously rather than in fixed batch intervals. As each new event flows through the pipeline, it is validated, transformed, and applied to the target system in near real time.\n\nWhat is the difference between ETL and CDC?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# UKG Ranked Top Overall in HCM for Second Consecutive Year *Nucleus Research HCM Technology Value Matrix 2023 features UKG Pro as overall Leader for large organizations; UKG Ready named Leader for smaller HR teams* LOWELL, Mass., and WESTON, Fla. **UKG**, a leading provider of HR, payroll, and workforce management solutions for all people, received the top overall ranking from Nucleus Research in the **HCM Technology Value Matrix 2023**, an annual, comprehensive evaluation of the human capital management (HCM) industry that analyzes how solution providers meet the needs of customers today while also helping them prepare for the future. We’re a global organization, and UKG scales with us as we grow.” In its report, Nucleus credits UKG for recent innovations in its UKG Pro HCM suite that enhance the employee experience and productivity, including: * **UKG Talk**, a frontline employee communication and collaboration tool; * **UKG Strategic Workforce Planning**, which extends schedule forecasting and capacity planning two years into the future; and * **Smart Pay Analytics**, an AI-model for payroll-error prevention. “UKG is so easy and simple to use, and it’s been a great benefit to have everything — HR, payroll, time management, recruiting, and benefits — all in one suite.” To help people achieve more in their flow of work, UKG **recently introduced FleX by UKG****.** FleX uses behavior-focused AI to anticipate employee needs and features an open architecture to help businesses continually benefit from emerging applications. “UKG is the overall Leader in our report for the second consecutive year based on the value it is able to deliver to customers today, as well as the company’s commitment to innovation as evidenced by recent efforts with Great Place To Work and the FleX platform, among many other enhancements,” said Evelyn McMullen, research director at Nucleus Research. “With economic uncertainty on the horizon, full-suite providers must double down on investments to ensure their customers can support people and operations.” “With more than $625 million invested in research and development in the last fiscal year, we are committed to delivering solutions that empower people with purpose and autonomy while helping organizations optimize teamwork and productivity,” said Hugo Sarrazin, chief product and technology officer at UKG.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation behind the scenes. By enabling agents to work together, you can achieve higher task success rates, accuracy, and enhanced productivity. In internal benchmark testing, multi-agent collaboration has shown marked improvements compared to single-agent systems for handling complex, multi-step tasks. [...] With the fully managed multi-agent collaboration capability on Amazon Bedrock, specialized agents work within their domains of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization. [...] I select the content-strategist agent and provide the collaborator name `content-strategist` along with the following instruction:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media content strategy tasks such as converting business goals into engaging social posts. The agent generates creative, on-brand content ideas that align with specified campaign goals and target audience.`\n\nThen, I choose Add collaborator, select the engagement-predictor agent, and provide the collaborator name `engagement-predictor` along with the following instructions:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media analytics to predict post performance and optimal timing.`&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Since the “ChatGPT moment” of late 2022, the tech industry has been treating it as an inevitability that generative AI will transform every aspect of business, and to some degree society. As technologists around the world digested the capabilities of large language models, they began hypothesizing how LLM’s could be combined with data and software functions to provide revolutionary process automation and human augmentation to drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity in every industry. The vehicle for this value would be an exploding population of “AI agents” that would perform tasks autonomously or in support of human workers. Thus began the age of “agentic AI.” [...] thumbnail\nModel-as-a-Service Part 1: The Basics\n\nModel-as-a-Service reflects a pragmatic response to the realities of modern AI adoption.

The next phase, which involves multi-agent systems, will determine who turns that accessibility into real, sustained value.\n\n## Featured Resources from Cloud Data Insights\n\nthumbnail\nThe Manual Migration Trap: Why 70% of Data Warehouse Modernization Projects Exceed Budget or Fail&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workato raises $25M for its integration platform | TechCrunch&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Workato raises $25M for its integration platform\n\nWorkato, a startup that offers an integration and automation platform for businesses that competes with the likes of MuleSoft, SnapLogic and Microsoft’s Logic Apps, today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series B funding round from Battery Ventures, Storm Ventures, ServiceNow and Workday Ventures. Combined with its previous rounds, the company has now received investments from some of the largest SaaS players, including Salesforce, which participated in an earlier round. [...] Tella also stressed that Workato makes extensive use of AI/ML to make building integrations and automations easier. The company calls this Recipe Q. “Leveraging the tens of billions of events processed, hundreds of millions of metadata elements inspected and hundreds of thousands of automations that people have built on our platform — we leverage ML to guide users to build the most effective integration/automation by recommending next steps as they build these automations,” he explained. “It recommends the next set of actions to take, fields to map, auto-validates mappings, etc. The great thing with this is that as people build more automations — it learns from them and continues to make the automation smarter.” [...] The AI/ML system also handles errors and offers features like sentiment analysis to analyze emails and detect their intent, with the ability to route them depending on the results of that analysis.\n\nAs part of today’s announcement, the company is also launching a new AI-enabled feature: Automation Editions for sales, marketing and HR (with editions for finance and support coming in the future). The idea here is to give those departments a kit with pre-built workflows that helps them to get started with the service without having to bring in IT.\n\nTopics\n\nFrederic Lardinois\n\nEditor\n\nEvent Logo&quot;,

Unlike Workato&#x27;s limited global deployment options, MuleSoft is compatible with all major public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) as well as private clouds and on-premises data centers. MuleSoft&#x27;s Anypoint Runtime Fabric provides flexibility to deploy and manage applications in a containerized, self-managed environment.\n\n### \n\nMuleSoft&#x27;s security is a defense-in-depth approach with features like encrypted data transport and compliance with key industry standards like HIPAA and GDPR.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Governance and Compliance [...] Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Successful implementation requires evaluating data quality, usability, integration capabilities, and governance features while following a phased rollout approach that includes manager training and change management.\n Tools like SalaryCube represent the next generation of compensation intelligence platforms that prioritize speed, transparency, and accessibility over complex, consultant-heavy traditional survey workflows.&quot;,

As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI. The technology, in short, is affecting more jobs, faster, and to a greater extent than we anticipated.&quot;,

This feature enhances security by allowing you to customize your password strength requirements.\n\n#### Workday supports incremental imports\n\nWorkday now has the ability to run immediate, incremental imports. Incremental imports are much faster than full imports. However, they don&#x27;t detect when users only have changes to custom attributes, so you must periodically run a full import to capture these changes. See Incremental imports\n\n#### Same-device enrollment for Okta FastPass [...] Active Directory imports failed with an \&quot;Incorrect result size\&quot; error when DirSync was enabled. This occurred because creating a new group in Active Directory generated duplicate entries during the import process. (OKTA-1082847)\n When users clicked the Microsoft Teams tile on the Okta End-User Dashboard, they were directed to an error page stating that \&quot;Classic Teams is no longer available.\&quot; This occurred because the destination URL was outdated following a change by Microsoft. (OKTA-1084267) [...] Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the LDAP or Active Directory (AD) integration. It isn&#x27;t possible to manage users and groups that weren&#x27;t imported through LDAP or AD integration or are outside the organizational unit&#x27;s scope for the integration using this feature.\n\n#### More granular maximum clock skew options for LDAP incremental imports&quot;,

[...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer.

Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Hospitality: AI-Driven Industry Trends&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The future of hospitality\n\nDownload PDF (7MB) View PDF\n\nAmid the stunning landscape of California’s Joshua Tree National Park, a new hotel debuted in 2025. Set across 180 acres of desert land, the hotel utilizes steel-frame modular units on commercially zoned property, aiming to meet visitor demand for accommodations while addressing community concerns about the impact of short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. Elsewhere, similar approaches are being taken: a recently opened eco-lodge near Grand Teton in Wyoming uses off-grid water and energy systems to minimize environmental disruption, while a small retreat in Vermont was converted from historic farm structures, integrating renewable energy and local materials to support the surrounding community. [...] ##### Tourism backlash\n\nWhen residents of Barcelona, Spain began spraying tourists with water guns, the images went viral. This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure. Wastewater from arriving cruise ships pollutes local ports. The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma [...] In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a U.S. federal law that establishes minimum wage, overtime pay eligibility, and recordkeeping requirements. Correct FLSA classification (exempt vs. non-exempt) is essential for legal compliance in compensation planning.\n\nMisaligned job descriptions and incorrect FLSA exempt/non-exempt classifications create legal risks that can undermine otherwise sophisticated compensation strategies. Wage and hour violations carry significant financial exposure through back pay obligations, penalties, and class action litigation, while inconsistent job documentation complicates benchmarking and makes range building unreliable.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] Exhibit 4\n\nImage description begins:\n\nThe exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] ### Beyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Survey Methodology The survey was conducted online by an independent research company between June 23 to July 17, 2025, and included 1,394 respondents, representing employees across industries and functions, and organizational sizes. Respondents included team leaders and team members and explored attitudes and behaviors related to AI use, team performance, skills development, and Enduring Human Capabilities™ — six core human attributes (curiosity, informed agility, resilience, divergent thinking, connected teaming, and social &amp; emotional intelligence) that are observable, independent of context, and are not easily replicated by technology. Results were analyzed by comparing responses from individuals who identified their teams as high performing with those who did not. Survey findings [...] The study surveyed 1,394 employees from a wide range of organizations, asking both team leaders and team members to report whether they are or have been part of a high-performing team — defined as teams that consistently meet or exceed expectations over time — and the attitudes and behaviors that define their success. Across demographic groups, including generations, respondents agreed: Human-centric skills are foundational to driving team performance.\n\nKey findings: What sets high-performing teams apart? The external survey found that while high-performing teams are significantly more likely to use AI tools in their work (78% vs. 54%), their strongest results come from how they work with each other. [...] High-Trust Environments:Members of surveyed high-performing teams are 2.3 times as likely to feel trusted by their team leader, 2.3 times as likely to feel respected and appreciated by peers, and nearly 1.5 times more likely to report feeling included. They also cited emotional and social intelligence as the top success factor for their team.\n Informed Agility and Autonomy: Respondents on high-performing teams were 2.5 times as likely to say their teams can quickly change direction and support each other in times of change. High-performing team members also report being three times more likely to experience greater autonomy, helping team members connect to purpose and strategic vision.&quot;,

And 47% of employees are worried about their skills staying relevant, up from just 17% in 2024.\n\n“With workforce skills requirements shifting rapidly, it’s essential to empower talent to continuously upskill. As skills—not jobs—become the new currency in the workplace, employees recognize the urgent need to stay relevant,” says Ravin Jesuthasan, Senior Partner and Mercer’s Global Leader for Transformation Services.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Hospitality: AI-Driven Industry Trends&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market. [...] The future of hospitality\n\nDownload PDF (7MB) View PDF\n\nAmid the stunning landscape of California’s Joshua Tree National Park, a new hotel debuted in 2025. Set across 180 acres of desert land, the hotel utilizes steel-frame modular units on commercially zoned property, aiming to meet visitor demand for accommodations while addressing community concerns about the impact of short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. Elsewhere, similar approaches are being taken: a recently opened eco-lodge near Grand Teton in Wyoming uses off-grid water and energy systems to minimize environmental disruption, while a small retreat in Vermont was converted from historic farm structures, integrating renewable energy and local materials to support the surrounding community. [...] ##### Tourism backlash\n\nWhen residents of Barcelona, Spain began spraying tourists with water guns, the images went viral. This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure. Wastewater from arriving cruise ships pollutes local ports. The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### Maximum consecutive characters setting for passwords\n\nYou can now set a maximum number of consecutive repeating characters in passwords. This feature enhances security by allowing you to customize your password strength requirements.\n\n#### Workday supports incremental imports\n\nWorkday now has the ability to run immediate, incremental imports. Incremental imports are much faster than full imports. However, they don&#x27;t detect when users only have changes to custom attributes, so you must periodically run a full import to capture these changes. See Incremental imports\n\n#### Same-device enrollment for Okta FastPass [...] Active Directory imports failed with an \&quot;Incorrect result size\&quot; error when DirSync was enabled. This occurred because creating a new group in Active Directory generated duplicate entries during the import process. (OKTA-1082847)\n When users clicked the Microsoft Teams tile on the Okta End-User Dashboard, they were directed to an error page stating that \&quot;Classic Teams is no longer available.\&quot; This occurred because the destination URL was outdated following a change by Microsoft. (OKTA-1084267) [...] Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the LDAP or Active Directory (AD) integration. It isn&#x27;t possible to manage users and groups that weren&#x27;t imported through LDAP or AD integration or are outside the organizational unit&#x27;s scope for the integration using this feature.\n\n#### More granular maximum clock skew options for LDAP incremental imports&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Future of Hospitality: AI-Driven Industry Trends&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market. [...] The future of hospitality\n\nDownload PDF (7MB) View PDF\n\nAmid the stunning landscape of California’s Joshua Tree National Park, a new hotel debuted in 2025. Set across 180 acres of desert land, the hotel utilizes steel-frame modular units on commercially zoned property, aiming to meet visitor demand for accommodations while addressing community concerns about the impact of short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. Elsewhere, similar approaches are being taken: a recently opened eco-lodge near Grand Teton in Wyoming uses off-grid water and energy systems to minimize environmental disruption, while a small retreat in Vermont was converted from historic farm structures, integrating renewable energy and local materials to support the surrounding community. [...] ##### Tourism backlash\n\nWhen residents of Barcelona, Spain began spraying tourists with water guns, the images went viral. This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure. Wastewater from arriving cruise ships pollutes local ports. The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma&quot;,

That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI. The technology, in short, is affecting more jobs, faster, and to a greater extent than we anticipated.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Survey Methodology The survey was conducted online by an independent research company between June 23 to July 17, 2025, and included 1,394 respondents, representing employees across industries and functions, and organizational sizes. Respondents included team leaders and team members and explored attitudes and behaviors related to AI use, team performance, skills development, and Enduring Human Capabilities™ — six core human attributes (curiosity, informed agility, resilience, divergent thinking, connected teaming, and social &amp; emotional intelligence) that are observable, independent of context, and are not easily replicated by technology. Results were analyzed by comparing responses from individuals who identified their teams as high performing with those who did not. Survey findings [...] The study surveyed 1,394 employees from a wide range of organizations, asking both team leaders and team members to report whether they are or have been part of a high-performing team — defined as teams that consistently meet or exceed expectations over time — and the attitudes and behaviors that define their success. Across demographic groups, including generations, respondents agreed: Human-centric skills are foundational to driving team performance.\n\nKey findings: What sets high-performing teams apart? The external survey found that while high-performing teams are significantly more likely to use AI tools in their work (78% vs. 54%), their strongest results come from how they work with each other. [...] High-Trust Environments:Members of surveyed high-performing teams are 2.3 times as likely to feel trusted by their team leader, 2.3 times as likely to feel respected and appreciated by peers, and nearly 1.5 times more likely to report feeling included. They also cited emotional and social intelligence as the top success factor for their team.\n Informed Agility and Autonomy: Respondents on high-performing teams were 2.5 times as likely to say their teams can quickly change direction and support each other in times of change. High-performing team members also report being three times more likely to experience greater autonomy, helping team members connect to purpose and strategic vision.&quot;,

And yet, open source rivals have not been far behind. [...] ## The Catch: Heavy Compute Requirements\n\nThe trade-off for this reasoning capability is compute intensity. The dual-model architecture is heavy. Generating a single 2048x2048 image requires approximately 252 seconds on an H100 GPU. This is significantly slower than highly optimized, smaller diffusion models.\n\nHowever, for high-value assets—where the alternative is a human designer spending hours in Photoshop—this latency is acceptable.\n\nZ.ai also offers a managed API at $0.015 per image, providing a bridge for teams who want to test the capabilities without investing in H100 clusters immediately.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;On January 1, CMS launched a pilot allowing AI to support prior-authorization decisions for certain medical services in traditional Medicare. The Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction (WISeR) program was rolled out in six states (Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington). AI will be used for decisions related to procedures including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve-stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy. CMS explains that those services are vulnerable to “fraud, waste, and abuse.” While other procedures may be added to the list in the future, inpatient and emergency procedures will not be subject to the AI assessment, according to CMS. The pilot program was developed to reduce wasteful, “low-value” services, according to a CMS statementvii. The [...] Generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to reduce the administrative workload associated with prior authorizations, enhance the accuracy of determinations, and reduce human error. The technology could be trained to mine medical records, clinical documentation, and the health plan’s own criteria to validate evidence of medical necessity and auto-approve requests. AI could also help health plans comply with the new regulations from CMS. Clinical oversight will still be needed. [...] Federally regulated health plans—including Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and coverage sold through HealthCare.gov—are now required to make standard prior-authorization decisions within seven calendar days, down from the current 14 days. Health plans that fail to comply with the rule, which went into effect on January 1, could face substantial penalties, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)i. The new rule does not change the current 72-hour timeframe for expedited prior-authorization decisions.&quot;,

This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure.

The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Survey Methodology The survey was conducted online by an independent research company between June 23 to July 17, 2025, and included 1,394 respondents, representing employees across industries and functions, and organizational sizes. Respondents included team leaders and team members and explored attitudes and behaviors related to AI use, team performance, skills development, and Enduring Human Capabilities™ — six core human attributes (curiosity, informed agility, resilience, divergent thinking, connected teaming, and social &amp; emotional intelligence) that are observable, independent of context, and are not easily replicated by technology. Results were analyzed by comparing responses from individuals who identified their teams as high performing with those who did not. Survey findings [...] The study surveyed 1,394 employees from a wide range of organizations, asking both team leaders and team members to report whether they are or have been part of a high-performing team — defined as teams that consistently meet or exceed expectations over time — and the attitudes and behaviors that define their success. Across demographic groups, including generations, respondents agreed: Human-centric skills are foundational to driving team performance.\n\nKey findings: What sets high-performing teams apart? The external survey found that while high-performing teams are significantly more likely to use AI tools in their work (78% vs. 54%), their strongest results come from how they work with each other. [...] High-Trust Environments:Members of surveyed high-performing teams are 2.3 times as likely to feel trusted by their team leader, 2.3 times as likely to feel respected and appreciated by peers, and nearly 1.5 times more likely to report feeling included. They also cited emotional and social intelligence as the top success factor for their team.\n Informed Agility and Autonomy: Respondents on high-performing teams were 2.5 times as likely to say their teams can quickly change direction and support each other in times of change. High-performing team members also report being three times more likely to experience greater autonomy, helping team members connect to purpose and strategic vision.&quot;,

This feature enhances security by allowing you to customize your password strength requirements.\n\n#### Workday supports incremental imports\n\nWorkday now has the ability to run immediate, incremental imports. Incremental imports are much faster than full imports. However, they don&#x27;t detect when users only have changes to custom attributes, so you must periodically run a full import to capture these changes. See Incremental imports\n\n#### Same-device enrollment for Okta FastPass [...] Active Directory imports failed with an \&quot;Incorrect result size\&quot; error when DirSync was enabled. This occurred because creating a new group in Active Directory generated duplicate entries during the import process. (OKTA-1082847)\n When users clicked the Microsoft Teams tile on the Okta End-User Dashboard, they were directed to an error page stating that \&quot;Classic Teams is no longer available.\&quot; This occurred because the destination URL was outdated following a change by Microsoft. (OKTA-1084267) [...] Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the LDAP or Active Directory (AD) integration. It isn&#x27;t possible to manage users and groups that weren&#x27;t imported through LDAP or AD integration or are outside the organizational unit&#x27;s scope for the integration using this feature.\n\n#### More granular maximum clock skew options for LDAP incremental imports&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI Could Help Health Plans Simplify Prior Auth, Comply ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;On January 1, CMS launched a pilot allowing AI to support prior-authorization decisions for certain medical services in traditional Medicare. The Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction (WISeR) program was rolled out in six states (Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington). AI will be used for decisions related to procedures including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve-stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy. CMS explains that those services are vulnerable to “fraud, waste, and abuse.” While other procedures may be added to the list in the future, inpatient and emergency procedures will not be subject to the AI assessment, according to CMS. The pilot program was developed to reduce wasteful, “low-value” services, according to a CMS statementvii. The [...] Generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to reduce the administrative workload associated with prior authorizations, enhance the accuracy of determinations, and reduce human error. The technology could be trained to mine medical records, clinical documentation, and the health plan’s own criteria to validate evidence of medical necessity and auto-approve requests. AI could also help health plans comply with the new regulations from CMS. Clinical oversight will still be needed. [...] Federally regulated health plans—including Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and coverage sold through HealthCare.gov—are now required to make standard prior-authorization decisions within seven calendar days, down from the current 14 days. Health plans that fail to comply with the rule, which went into effect on January 1, could face substantial penalties, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)i. The new rule does not change the current 72-hour timeframe for expedited prior-authorization decisions.&quot;,

Set across 180 acres of desert land, the hotel utilizes steel-frame modular units on commercially zoned property, aiming to meet visitor demand for accommodations while addressing community concerns about the impact of short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods. Elsewhere, similar approaches are being taken: a recently opened eco-lodge near Grand Teton in Wyoming uses off-grid water and energy systems to minimize environmental disruption, while a small retreat in Vermont was converted from historic farm structures, integrating renewable energy and local materials to support the surrounding community. [...] ##### Tourism backlash\n\nWhen residents of Barcelona, Spain began spraying tourists with water guns, the images went viral. This act of revolt illustrates what’s happening in many high-traffic areas as mass tourism strains life for local residents. Housing prices soar. Large crowds overrun local infrastructure. Wastewater from arriving cruise ships pollutes local ports. The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Imagine a world where machines not only perform physical labor but also think, learn, and make autonomous decisions. This world includes humans in the loop, bringing people and machines together in a state of superagency that increases personal productivity and creativity (see sidebar “AI superagency”). This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide—and even make—decisions. That’s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will [...] Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As many of the world’s largest employers prepare to meet in Davos to discuss how AI is transforming work, Mercer’s signature talent trends survey, of nearly 12,000 business executives, HR leaders, investors, and employees worldwide, now in its 11th year, highlights the strategies to achieve sustainable success through human-AI teaming.\n\n\&quot;In the race to adopt AI, organizations that cling to outdated work models risk falling behind, as many are merely substituting old approaches with technology rather than transforming how work is done,\&quot; said Pat Tomlinson, Mercer’s President and CEO. \&quot;True value comes from reinventing work itself—deconstructing, redeploying, and reconstructing it to optimize human-AI collaboration and create meaningful long-term gains.\&quot; [...] NEW YORK, January 14, 2026 ­─­ Mercer, a business of Marsh (NYSE: MRSH) and a global leader in helping clients realize their investment objectives, shape the future of work and enhance health and retirement outcomes for their people, today released the preliminary findings of its Global Talent Trends 2026 report. These initial insights, from one of the four trends featured in this year’s report, reveal that many employers are still struggling to unlock the full value of artificial intelligence (AI) due to a critical missing element: intentional work redesign.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This trepidation translates into a more negative outlook on work. Employees scared by AI are more likely to dread starting their workday (56% vs. 23% of those not scared by AI). These findings suggest that AI-related anxiety can have far-reaching consequences for worker wellbeing and job satisfaction.\n\n32%\n\nof employees express concern about what AI will mean in the future\n\n28%\n\nof employees feel suspicious about the technology’s output\n\n17%\n\nof employees feel genuinely curious about the potential of AI [...] The root of the fear: job securityAs an increasing number of workers find themselves expected to use AI in their daily work,  job loss anxiety has emerged as a critical emotional driver. While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks.

Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Z.ai&#x27;s open source GLM-Image beats Google&#x27;s Nano ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;My prompt to generate an \&quot;infographic labeling all the major constellations visible from the U.S. Northern Hemisphere right now on Jan 14 2026 and putting faded images of their namesakes behind the star connection line diagrams\&quot; did not result in what I asked for, instead fulfilling maybe 20% or less of the specified content.\n\nBut Google&#x27;s Nano Banana Pro handled it like a champ, as you&#x27;ll see below:\n\nOf course, a large portion of this is no doubt due to the fact that Nano Banana Pro is integrated with Google search, so it can look up information on the web in response to my prompt, whereas GLM-Image is not, and therefore, likely requires far more specific instructions about the actual text and other content the image should contain. [...] All Posts\n\n# Z.ai&#x27;s open source GLM-Image beats Google&#x27;s Nano Banana Pro at complex text rendering, but not aesthetics\n\nCarl Franzen\n\nThe two big stories of AI in 2026 so far have been the incredible rise in usage and praise for Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code and a similar huge boost in user adoption for Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 AI model family released late last year — the latter of which includes Nano Banana Pro (also known as Gemini 3 Pro Image), a powerful, fast, and flexible image generation model that renders complex, text-heavy infographics quickly and accurately, making it an excellent fit for enterprise use (think: collateral, trainings, onboarding, stationary, etc).\n\nBut of course, both of those are proprietary offerings. And yet, open source rivals have not been far behind. [...] ## The Catch: Heavy Compute Requirements\n\nThe trade-off for this reasoning capability is compute intensity. The dual-model architecture is heavy. Generating a single 2048x2048 image requires approximately 252 seconds on an H100 GPU. This is significantly slower than highly optimized, smaller diffusion models.\n\nHowever, for high-value assets—where the alternative is a human designer spending hours in Photoshop—this latency is acceptable.\n\nZ.ai also offers a managed API at $0.015 per image, providing a bridge for teams who want to test the capabilities without investing in H100 clusters immediately.&quot;,

While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI. The technology, in short, is affecting more jobs, faster, and to a greater extent than we anticipated.&quot;,

Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] Exhibit 4\n\nImage description begins:\n\nThe exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] ### Beyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

[...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This trepidation translates into a more negative outlook on work.

While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;On January 1, CMS launched a pilot allowing AI to support prior-authorization decisions for certain medical services in traditional Medicare. The Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction (WISeR) program was rolled out in six states (Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington). AI will be used for decisions related to procedures including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve-stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy. CMS explains that those services are vulnerable to “fraud, waste, and abuse.” While other procedures may be added to the list in the future, inpatient and emergency procedures will not be subject to the AI assessment, according to CMS. The pilot program was developed to reduce wasteful, “low-value” services, according to a CMS statementvii. The [...] Generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to reduce the administrative workload associated with prior authorizations, enhance the accuracy of determinations, and reduce human error. The technology could be trained to mine medical records, clinical documentation, and the health plan’s own criteria to validate evidence of medical necessity and auto-approve requests. AI could also help health plans comply with the new regulations from CMS. Clinical oversight will still be needed. [...] Federally regulated health plans—including Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and coverage sold through HealthCare.gov—are now required to make standard prior-authorization decisions within seven calendar days, down from the current 14 days. Health plans that fail to comply with the rule, which went into effect on January 1, could face substantial penalties, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)i. The new rule does not change the current 72-hour timeframe for expedited prior-authorization decisions.&quot;,

The environmental stress has contributed to insurers raising premiums and forced local governments to put limits, taxes, and rental bans into place.\n\nFor the hospitality industry, the risks seem clear: Expanding operations under these conditions means likely dealing with an increasingly fraught local landscape.\n\n##### The workforce dilemma&quot;,

As it turns out, though, we underestimated the impact of the technology.\n\nWhat we projected might take until 2032 to unfold is happening now before our eyes. Today—six years ahead of schedule—93% of jobs could be impacted in some way by AI. In the US alone, this could add up to about $4.5 trillion worth of labor shifting from humans to AI. The technology, in short, is affecting more jobs, faster, and to a greater extent than we anticipated.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] Exhibit 4\n\nImage description begins:\n\nThe exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] ### Beyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As many of the world’s largest employers prepare to meet in Davos to discuss how AI is transforming work, Mercer’s signature talent trends survey, of nearly 12,000 business executives, HR leaders, investors, and employees worldwide, now in its 11th year, highlights the strategies to achieve sustainable success through human-AI teaming.\n\n\&quot;In the race to adopt AI, organizations that cling to outdated work models risk falling behind, as many are merely substituting old approaches with technology rather than transforming how work is done,\&quot; said Pat Tomlinson, Mercer’s President and CEO. \&quot;True value comes from reinventing work itself—deconstructing, redeploying, and reconstructing it to optimize human-AI collaboration and create meaningful long-term gains.\&quot; [...] NEW YORK, January 14, 2026 ­─­ Mercer, a business of Marsh (NYSE: MRSH) and a global leader in helping clients realize their investment objectives, shape the future of work and enhance health and retirement outcomes for their people, today released the preliminary findings of its Global Talent Trends 2026 report. These initial insights, from one of the four trends featured in this year’s report, reveal that many employers are still struggling to unlock the full value of artificial intelligence (AI) due to a critical missing element: intentional work redesign.

[...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries. [...] Automated calculation of compa-ratios (the ratio of an employee’s pay to the midpoint of the pay range for their role) and range penetration provides immediate context for every employee within structured pay bands. The platform should color-code or flag employees below range minimums, above range maximums, or clustered in ways that suggest compression problems. These calculations update dynamically as managers enter merit or promotion recommendations, providing real-time feedback on how decisions affect internal equity and budget utilization.\n\nBudget-Aware Planning&quot;,

According to KPMG’s 2025 Banking Technology Survey, 70% of U.S. banking leaders have already achieved meaningful cost savings by automating routine tasks – like fraud detection, compliance, and financial forecasting.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Turnkey integrations with major HRIS and payroll systems—including Workday, UKG, ADP, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle, BambooHR, and Rippling—enable automated data flows rather than manual uploads each cycle.\n Single sign-on support through common identity providers like Okta and Azure AD ensures seamless access while maintaining security standards.\n The ability to import existing survey data from providers like Mercer, Radford, ERI, and Culpepper protects previous investments while enabling gradual transition to real-time datasets. [...] SalaryCube’s compensation intelligence platform integrates these capabilities through workflows that combine real-time benchmark access, unlimited scenario modeling, and transparent audit documentation. The emphasis on defensible methodology and unlimited reporting ensures HR teams can generate analysis, validate decisions, and communicate rationale without encountering artificial usage limits or additional fees.\n\nWith these capabilities in mind, the next step is to understand how real-time market data and internal information are used in practical compensation planning workflows.\n\nConnecting Real-Time Market Data to Pay Ranges [...] Market Pricing Capabilities\n\nMarket pricing capabilities should enable HR teams to quickly benchmark any role against current U.S. market conditions.  Users select specific job titles, experience levels, and geographic locations—whether San Francisco Bay Area, Denver metro, Atlanta region, or fully remote U.S.—and retrieve current percentile data for base salary, total cash compensation, and equity packages. AI-assisted job matching helps align internal position titles with external benchmarks, particularly valuable for hybrid roles like “DevOps Engineer with AI/ML focus” or “Revenue Operations Analyst” that span traditional job family boundaries.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. [...] The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Beyond Productivity: How Leaders Can Drive Real ROI ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we recently asked thousands of professionals how AI is delivering real ROI and how it’s actually changing their average work day. What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] Right now, only 14% of employees say they consistently get clear, positive results from their AI use. That is not because the technology isn’t working. It is because most organizations are still stuck in deployment mode, not transformation mode.\n\nAs Aashna Kircher, Workday’s Group General Manager, puts it:\n\n“Individual tasks are getting faster, but organizational outcomes are not improving at the same rate. Instead of freeing people to do more meaningful work, a surprising amount of time is cycling back into rework, oversight, and burnout.”\n\nThat gap between effort and impact is the real ROI problem. And the potential for leaders is to fully transform their organizations for the AI age. This is not hyperbole. Our research proves it. [...] That is where efficiency becomes growth, where AI starts to deliver real ROI, not just faster check marks on employee task lists.\n\n## Authorizing the AI-Ready Workforce\n\nAccording to our president of EMEA, Angelique De Vries, “productivity on its own cannot secure prosperity.”\n\nTo drive real ROI, we have to move past the belief that technology alone fixes productivity. This is not a software problem. It is a people and operating model problem.\n\nAashna advises us to focus on the value created, not just hours saved, because “the real question is not what AI can do, but who we want people to become in an AI-powered world.”\n\nAnd Workday data shows exactly where leaders need to focus.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This trepidation translates into a more negative outlook on work. Employees scared by AI are more likely to dread starting their workday (56% vs. 23% of those not scared by AI). These findings suggest that AI-related anxiety can have far-reaching consequences for worker wellbeing and job satisfaction.\n\n32%\n\nof employees express concern about what AI will mean in the future\n\n28%\n\nof employees feel suspicious about the technology’s output\n\n17%\n\nof employees feel genuinely curious about the potential of AI [...] The root of the fear: job securityAs an increasing number of workers find themselves expected to use AI in their daily work,  job loss anxiety has emerged as a critical emotional driver. While 39% of employees admit that AI scares them, it’s clear they aren&#x27;t afraid of the technology itself, but rather what it might mean for their professional futures. One-third of Mindset respondents say they fear AI will take away their job, while nearly half (45%) are concerned they will fall behind if they don’t learn how to use it. Yet while workers feel a sense of urgency for learning AI, 44% believe it has a long way to go before it can be useful. [...] As AI continues to reshape the workplace, employees’ attitudes reflect a mix of optimism and apprehension about its potential impact on their careers. Aware that artificial intelligence isn’t going away, they have accepted that AI will be increasingly interwoven into everything they do — at work and at home. Try as they might to despise this inevitable encroachment, many people are feeling a sense of excitement about exploring the technology and discovering what it can do.\n\nAI apprehension crosses generations&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] ## A Final Word\n\nThese are exciting times in our industry! It’s easy to get swept up in the zeitgeist and yearn for silver bullets. Personally, I find it reassuring that the time worn principles that underpin this article still apply, even in the age of AI. So keep going, stay curious, and let MCP be the question that leads you to the next question. Keep answering, keep digging, and you’ll find you are on a road paved with business value.\n\nthumbnail\nMatt McLarty\n\n## Matt McLarty [...] AI agents have LLM-based reasoning, which means they can plan and execute tasks from a series of subtasks. However, they are not deterministic, and LLM-based planning is an inefficient and expensive function. Tools, on the other hand, are deterministic and repeatable. When it comes to agentic processing, the more deterministic and repeatable tasks can be made, the better. That means that the MCP interface should be at the coarsest granularity possible for a particular task. As an example, imagine an agent discovering an MCP server that is a facade over the Salesforce API, which includes hundreds of data objects with multiple operations each. Performing a task as simple as “create customer” would require tens of tool calls with repeated sequential planning to boot. It is a much better&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times a day. Finally, 10 percent of report not at all. [...] Exhibit 4\n\nImage description begins:\n\nThe exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each sentiment within each age group. [...] ### Beyond the tipping point\n\nIn our survey, nearly all employees (94 percent) and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;8 CIO recommendations for ERP implementation in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;In what was once a sleepy applications space, ERP is being reimagined with agentic AI capabilities,\&quot; is how John Van Decker, a distinguished analyst at Dresner Advisory Services, explained the change. He said agentic AI&#x27;s ability to prioritize tasks and interact with applications across finance, supply chain and HR ecosystems -- and to continuously improve through feedback and learning -- transforms ERP \&quot;from a set of software tools into an intelligent workforce.\&quot;                  \n\nRelated:What CIOs should know about rare earths\n\n## The shift: From passive tools to proactive agents [...] Software Platforms\n Software &amp; Services\n Machine Learning &amp; AI\n Commentary\n\n# 8 CIO recommendations for ERP implementation in 2026: Think agentic\n\nAgentic AI is changing ERP into an intelligent workforce in 2026. Engage vendors early, think through how humans and agents will work together, and establish a risk mitigation framework.\n\nMyles Suer, CIO Analyst and Tech Journalist\n\nJanuary 14, 2026\n\n4 Min Read\n\nAleksey Funtap via Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) suites have long underpinned global business operations. Their purpose has been to codify best practices, optimize business processes, improve data management and support informed decision-making. Agentic AI, however, creates an opportunity to rethink how an ERP implementation supports core business capabilities. [...] ## The shift: From passive tools to proactive agents\n\nSince the rise of the modern enterprise, people have managed core business processes across finance, supply chain and manufacturing. Management theorist Gary Hamel has observed that many of the processes still in use today were originally designed during the early Industrial Revolution. Now, many tasks that humans have performed for more than a century -- and which were later embedded within ERP implementations -- are shifting to agentic AI. Here, agents will increasingly take on work across finance and planning, supply chain management and procurement, manufacturing, HR and customer service.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For Phenom, the acquisition strengthens its application of AI for workforce intelligence, as human resources professionals and executives will be empowered to not only access more in-depth data insights but also take action that drives workforce planning and growth.\n\nPhenom’s seventh acquisition, Included expands the value of applying intelligence, automation and experience to people analytics and allows Phenom to continue its commitment to delivering AI solutions to address HR’s greatest challenges.\n\n“Every acquisition we make is intentional and highly selective, pursuing only those that complement our innovation roadmap and strengthen our ability to solve our customers’ biggest hiring and retention challenges,” said Phenom co-founder and Chief Executive Mahe Bayireddi. [...] UPDATED 08:30 EST / JANUARY 14 2026\n\n### Phenom acquires Included to expand agentic people analytics capabilities\n\nby  Duncan Riley\n\nArtificial intelligence-based human resources company Phenom People Inc. announced today that it has acquired Included Inc., an AI-native agentic people analytics platform company that claims to surface actionable insights for faster, smarter workforce decision-making, for an undisclosed price.\n\nFounded in 2021, Included aims to help organizations harness the power of their employee data. Its platform integrates disparate HR and people data sources, such as HR information systems, applicant tracking systems and performance and engagement tools, into a unified dataset. [...] “Deeper people analytics and workforce planning insights are no longer optional; they’re the foundation for building agile, future-ready teams,” added Bayireddi. “The acquisition of Included expands our ability to deliver contextualized Applied AI capabilities for every persona and organization.”\n\nComing into its acquisition, Included had raised $7.3 million over two rounds, according to data from Tracxn. Investors in the company included Trilogy Equity Partners LP, Flying Fish Ventures, SignalFire LP, Alumni Ventures Group and Ascend Venture Capital.\n\n##### Image: Included\n\n# A message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;For agentic AI, other disciplines need their own Git&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Software is unusually forgiving of mistakes. A bad commit can be reverted. A merge can be blocked. Even a production outage usually leaves behind logs and artifacts. Version management works in part because the world it governs is reversible.\n\nMany other disciplines are not.\n\n## Pulling irreversible levers\n\nConsider HR. Imagine an organization asking an AI agent to terminate a vendor contract with “Joe’s Plumbing.” The agent misinterprets the context and instead terminates the employment of a human employee named Joe Plummer. There is no pull request. No staging environment. No clean revert. Payroll is cut, access is revoked, and legal exposure begins immediately. Even if the error is caught minutes later, the damage is already real. [...] Abigail Wall is AI product and GTM leader at Runloop.AI, where she drives development of infrastructure and tools powering next-generation AI agents. She holds an M.S. in computational data analytics from Georgia Institute of Technology and an MBA from Darden School of Business. With strategic experience at BCG and more than 16 years in ownership and founding roles across retail and fintech industries, Wall applies her analytical expertise to solve complex, real-world problems by leveraging machine learning across diverse sectors. Her unique combination of deep data science education, strategic consulting experience and hands-on operational leadership positions allow her to evaluate AI agents and agentic workflows from both technical and practical implementation perspectives. [...] Consider a simple example. Imagine a product marketing team using an AI agent to maintain competitive intelligence. The agent gathers information, synthesizes insights, and updates a master brief used by sales and leadership. This seems straightforward—until the agent edits the document.\n\nIn software, Git handles this effortlessly. Every change has a branch. Every branch produces a diff. Every diff is reviewed. Every merge is recorded. Every version is reproducible. Agents can propose changes safely because the workflow itself enforces isolation and accountability.\n\n## Life without version control&quot;,

AI could also help health plans comply with the new regulations from CMS. Clinical oversight will still be needed. [...] perspective needed to train AI models and validate the decisionsv. [...] Adding clinical staff to comply with CMS’s updated prior-authorization regulations is probably not a sustainable model. While AI adoption varies across the industry, its ability to mine medical records, validate clinical criteria, and surface relevant insights could position it as an important tool for meeting new turnaround mandates and reporting standards. If used correctly, AI could also be a lever for increased quality and consistency in prior-authorization reviews. Along with helping to reduce administrative costs, AI could also result in faster prior-authorization decisions. But the technology should be viewed only as an augmentation for clinical staff.\n\nLatest news from @DeloitteHealth\n\nEndnotes&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nearly three-quarters of chief executives (72%) say that they are now the main decision makers on AI, twice the share as last year. And while half of CEOs believe their jobs are on the line if AI does not pay off, four out of five of them are more optimistic about AI’s ROI potential than they were a year ago. The rapid maturity of AI agents is one of the main reasons, with about 90% of chief executives believing that agents will enable their companies to see measurable ROI in 2026. As a result, CEOs have committed more than 30% of their organization’s AI investment for this year into agentic AI. [...] Trailblazers have also been earlier and more assertive in pursuing AI agents. They are directing more than half of their 2026 AI corporate investments to agents, and are about twice as likely as Followers to deploy agents end-to-end across a workstream or process.\n\nCorporate AI Investment Will Double This Year\n\nIn doubling their investment this year, companies are drawing from budgets beyond the tech pool and CEOs have committed more than 30% of their organizations’ AI investments on agentic AI. Ninety-four percent of chief executives say they will continue investing in AI at current or higher levels even if the investments do not pay off in the next year. [...] The survey points to a set of actions that will matter most as CEOs steer their organizations through the next phase of AI:\n\n Make AI your key priority. Position the organization to be the disruptor, not the disrupted.\n Deepen AI literacy. Expand individual AI fluency to effectively lead transformations.\n Commit investments at scale. Invest decisively across end-to-end business functions.\n Upskill the organization. Upskill the workforce to optimize productivity, creativity, and judgment.\n Expect measurable ROI from AI.

Executive respondents were blunt: the limiting factor is no longer whether to bring AI into workflows — it’s whether the organization can safely connect AI to the data and processes that actually run the business.\n\nThe signal is strongest from CIOs and CFOs:\n\n CIOs worry trust impedes adoption. They cite data security, data privacy, and trusted data as top three fears regarding AI adoption.\n For CFOs, security/privacy threats keep them up at night. Two-thirds, (66%) say these threats are their top AI concern. [...] “As companies move toward becoming agentic enterprises, true transformation happens when data and AI move in lockstep,” said Michael Andrew, Chief Data Officer, Salesforce. “Strong data foundations give AI the context it needs, and AI, in turn, helps leaders unlock the full potential of their data. The organizations treating data and AI as an integrated strategy are the ones who will successfully move from pilots to execution to see AI deliver significant impact.”\n\n## 4. The C-suite is not always in lockstep about where AI agents will drive most impact across the workforce\n\nOne of the most important dynamics found in the surveys: leadership teams are not uniformly aligned on which roles AI agents will transform most.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Architecting with Context: Salesforce and Informatica&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## How Salesforce and Informatica work together\n\nInformatica offers a cloud-native, AI-powered platform for holistic data management. Its Intelligent Data Management Cloud (IDMC) serves as a comprehensive toolkit for managing the enterprise data landscape.\n\nInformatica provides end-to-end capabilities for data integration, quality, governance, and mastering with a system of metadata intelligence.”\n\nArchitects can build a trusted, unified data foundation by combining Salesforce’s unparalleled view of the customer relationship with Informatica’s enterprise-grade data management. This combination transforms enterprise-wide data into a core asset for autonomous action.\n\nThere are four key areas where Salesforce and Informatica complement each other to deliver the Agentic Enterprise together: [...] Consider two scenarios:\n\nThis reliance on data introduces a massive architectural challenge. If an agent is fed fragmented, siloed, or duplicate data, it may not error out, but it may instead build a flawed model of reality. It risks executing a transaction based on false premises. To build an Agentic Enterprise that is both powerful and safe, we need a data foundation built on absolute trust and deep context.\n\nUnlike a human employee, an agent lacks the intuition to spot a duplicate customer record or question a suspicious inventory number. Agents need help to understand the meaning behind the data. Therefore, the data feed must be pristine, governed, and unified before the agent ever touches it.\n\n## Architecting context for the Agentic Enterprise [...] ## Explore the Informatica Data Architect Center\n\nPractical guidance for designing modern cloud data architecture that supports agentic AI.\n\n## How Informatica brings the Agentic Enterprise to life\n\nInformatica’s platform provides the core capabilities to build this new foundation.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Since the “ChatGPT moment” of late 2022, the tech industry has been treating it as an inevitability that generative AI will transform every aspect of business, and to some degree society. As technologists around the world digested the capabilities of large language models, they began hypothesizing how LLM’s could be combined with data and software functions to provide revolutionary process automation and human augmentation to drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity in every industry. The vehicle for this value would be an exploding population of “AI agents” that would perform tasks autonomously or in support of human workers. Thus began the age of “agentic AI.” [...] # MCP Isn’t the Answer, It’s the Question\n\nthumbnail\nMCP Isn’t the Answer, It’s the Question\n\nThe AI Agents concept envisions future AI applications such as search, data analysis, and creative tools. This concept reflects the innovation and future of work powered by AI. Idea\n\nAgentic AI promises to unlock massive productivity and efficiency gains for organizations, but those results are not being realized yet. Many see MCP (Model Context Protocol) as the key, but it will only provide the desired business impact if implemented in the right way.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;10 Agentic AI Use Cases for Your Startup&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Use case #10: Agentic AI for inventory management\n\nKeeping track of inventory always sounds simple until you try to do it. Field teams are managing trucks and load documents, while supervisors are trying to make sense of what’s expected versus what’s actually on hand. Small mistakes can add up fast, leading to lost stock and frustrated customers.\n\nAgentic AI takes the stress out of the process by automatically summarising inventory status in real time. It shows you what was expected, what actually went out, and where the gaps are. Maybe stock was left on the truck. Maybe it never made it into the load sheet. You no longer need to piece the story together yourself. You get a clear summary in seconds and can fix issues before they snowball. [...] So where does it live? Agentic AI lives right inside your customer relationship management (CRM) tool. It’s part of what we call the agentic layer — an intelligent system that connects to your business data and tools. Once an AI agent is trained to reach a goal, it will figure out the steps and finish the task without constant inputs. It never sleeps, and doesn’t miss any details.\n\n### Why agentic AI matters for startups\n\nAgentic AI is a practical shift in how work gets done, especially for teams that need to do more with less. Here’s how building and training an AI agent makes all the difference for startups.\n\n## Section Title\n\nA small business owner using a laptop with an AI assistant displayed on the screen.\n\n#### What Is an AI Agent For Small Business? [...] Works 24/7 without extra management  \nOnce these agents are trained, they don’t need reminders or approvals. They run in the background 24/7, handling routine tasks, helping your business keep moving while you’re off the clock.\n\nConnects your tools for better team alignment  \nAgentic AI moves information between your apps automatically by connecting your tools and sharing updates across them in real time. Emails, messages, tasks, and updates stay in sync without anyone needing to copy-paste or follow up manually. Everyone stays informed and one step ahead.\n\nWith that foundation in place, let’s look at ten agentic AI use cases that show how startups are already putting it to work.\n\n## Top 10 Agentic AI use cases for small businesses\n\n### Use case #1: Agentic AI in sales meeting prep&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How to automate, optimize, and scale agentic AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Consider cloud and mobile. These technologies made business life easier by assisting human workers. But agentic AI is closer to a virtual human being. It isn’t just helping out; it acts independently based on the authority delegated to it. It could be doing existing tasks much faster, or taking on brand new roles that humans cannot do. Monitoring and governance take on new significance. Just as the human workforce needs an HR framework that sets out expectations, roles, and responsibilities in the workplace, so AI agents need a governance and control structure to manage their activity to proactively avoid security, compliance, or ethical risks. [...] Data privacy and security: AI runs best in the cloud. But many businesses, especially those in highly regulated sectors, hold sensitive data that needs to stay on-premise. Balancing compute efficiency with data privacy and compliance controls is a constant challenge – and can be a significant hurdle to getting real business value from agentic AI.\nIn the best cases, these challenges slow down time-to-value. In the worst, they derail it completely. The planned business benefits fail to materialize, and it takes even longer for AI to gain necessary trust. A new kind of HR challenge The challenges of agentic AI are familiar to anyone who has led the implementation of advanced data-driven systems and solutions. But there is a unique AI flavor that the HR challenge illuminates. [...] 01 02 6 From prompt to purpose: Unlocking business value with agentic AI Operational siloes and integration challenges: AI agents are intended to collaborate with each other and with the human workforce. But disconnected AI tools are poor partners that struggle to cooperate across different functions. Businesses end up duplicating effort, which slows adoption. Transformation is squashed and businesses end up with just a more expensive version of “business as usual.” Unpredictable costs and inconsistent performance: AI models degrade over time and performance drops off, just like a valued but overworked employee. But any problems with an AI agent can be much harder to find and fix. Optimization is necessary, but it’s a matter of guesswork when projects don’t have clear visibility into&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP Isn&#x27;t the Answer, It&#x27;s the Question&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Still, there is a long way to go. Although the MCP authorization protocol is now well-defined, the complexity of seemingly simplistic agentic workflows can exceed what the spec currently provides. For example, imagine an AI agent whose purpose is to help Human Resources workers with employee onboarding. That agent might need tools to add employee contact information in Workday, add payroll details in ADP, and open tickets in ServiceNow to issue new IT equipment. This use case alone would need to consider the identity of the HR worker, the scope of the agent, and the permission level required to access each back end application. Given the dynamic nature of agentic processing, ensuring appropriate access control is even more critical than in more deterministic settings. [...] Since the “ChatGPT moment” of late 2022, the tech industry has been treating it as an inevitability that generative AI will transform every aspect of business, and to some degree society. As technologists around the world digested the capabilities of large language models, they began hypothesizing how LLM’s could be combined with data and software functions to provide revolutionary process automation and human augmentation to drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity in every industry. The vehicle for this value would be an exploding population of “AI agents” that would perform tasks autonomously or in support of human workers. Thus began the age of “agentic AI.” [...] See also: MCP: Enabling the Next Phase of Enterprise AI\n\n## How can you make sure your MCP tools are the ones your AI agents need?\n\nThe common pattern emerging for rapidly exposing data and functions as MCP servers is to simply layer an MCP facade over an existing web API. The problem with this approach is that most APIs are designed for human users, not machines. In the name of flexibility, many web APIs are created as a set of “CRUD” (Create Read Update Delete) operations on top of a set of data objects. Although this design approach can support many use cases, it is not optimal for human users either. However, humans have the capacity to independently find or figure out the information needed to use the APIs. Machines–even AI agents–are not as adept.&quot;,

That is: They will begin designing agents to automate workflows.\n\nAgent builder platforms continue to innovate their no-code solutions, Sanders said, meaning nearly anyone can now stand up an agent using natural language. “This will democratize agentic AI, and the super skill will be the ability to express a goal, provide context and envision pitfalls, very similar to a good people manager today.”\n\n## What enterprise leaders should be doing now [...] ## What enterprise leaders should be doing now\n\nAgent-first automation stacks “dramatically outperform” hybrid automation stacks in almost every attribute, he noted: satisfaction, quality of actions, security, cost savings.\n\nOrganizations should begin “expeditious programs” to infuse agents across workflows, especially with highly repetitive work that poses bottlenecks. Likely at first, there will be a strong human-in-the-loop element to ensure quality and promote change management.\n\n“Serving as an evaluator will strengthen the understanding of how these systems work,” Sanders said, “and eventually enable all of us to operate upstream in agentic workflows instead of downstream.” [...] All Posts\n\n# AI agents can talk — orchestration is what makes them work together\n\nTaryn Plumb\n\nRather than asking how AI agents can work for them, a key question in enterprise is now: Are agents playing well together?\n\nThis makes orchestration across multi-agent systems and platforms a critical concern — and a key differentiator.\n\n“Agent-to-agent communications is emerging as a really big deal,” G2’s chief innovation officer Tim Sanders told VentureBeat. “Because if you don&#x27;t orchestrate it, you get misunderstandings, like people speaking foreign languages to each other. Those misunderstandings reduce the quality of actions and raise the specter of hallucinations, which could be security incidents or data leakage.”\n\n## Allowing agents to talk and coordinate&quot;,

At the heart of this evolution is an agentic AI framework, where specialized, task-specific agents take on clearly defined responsibilities based on real business context, data, and rules. These agents work together behind the scenes, while Joule serves as the orchestration layer that brings insights, recommendations, and next steps together in a natural, conversational way. Whether supporting a finance expert with complex classifications or helping teams respond faster to operational issues, intelligence is applied exactly where decisions are made.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in SAP SuccessFactors (2026) — The Change Manag...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Now Part 2 goes where most programs struggle: change management - including how to enable frontline managers to confidently handle human-in-the-loop responsibilities (reviewing AI output, validating key facts, and owning final decisions). In 2026, AI in HR has moved beyond pilots; organizations are wiring AI into everyday SuccessFactors workflows through Joule and embedded capabilities. The teams that win won’t be the ones that merely “turn on” AI - they’ll be the ones that treat adoption as a product: clear outcomes, clear boundaries, and a manager-led reinforcement model.\n\n## What you’ll get in this blog\n\n## 0) A quick reality check: what changed in 2026\n\nAI in SuccessFactors typically shows up in three layers: [...] |  |  |  |  |\n ---  --- |\n| Dimension | Metric | Description | Pilot target example |\n| Adoption | Active Joule users (7/30 days) | Unique users issuing AI queries in a given window | 40–60% of pilot |\n| Adoption | Repeat users | Users active in at least 3 weeks out of 4 | Upward trend weekly |\n| Value | Ticket deflection | Reduction in HR support tickets for “how do I” topics | 10–25% reduction |\n| Value | Time-to-complete | Median completion time for 3–5 frequent transactions | 20–40% reduction |\n| Trust | Confidence / sentiment score | Pulse: “I understand what is safe and I trust boundaries” | &gt;75% favorable |\n| Safety | Permission boundary incidents | Escalations about access/scope issues | Flat or decreasing | [...] Manager shortcut: If an AI output could influence a people decision, apply this habit: Verify → Apply judgment → Decide → Document.\n\n### 4.3 Five starter tasks (managers can run in 10 minutes)\n\n## 5) Prepare employees before launch (trust + clarity + support)\n\nEmployees will adopt AI only if they trust boundaries and understand what is safe. Before launch, explicitly answer: What can I use it for? What should I not use it for? What data can it access? Who is accountable?\n\n### Pre-launch employee readiness checklist\n\n## 6) Communications plan (pre-launch → launch → sustain)\n\nCommunication is not “one email.” It is a rhythm: trust + clarity + reinforcement, avoiding both hype and silence about guardrails.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI-powered: Gain immediate value from pre-built AI features and data models, or use our tools to build your own AI apps and agents that have all the capabilities your company needs. With autonomous, AI-driven solutioning at scale, you’ll be one step closer to your resolution of deeper AI transformation.\n Turnkey: The pre-configured program scope is built on best-in-class industry practices for ease and speed of integration. No need to reinvent the wheel—but ready-to-go APIs and supporting tools mean you’re free to extend without major headaches. Either way, you’ll be set up in no time with the centralized visibility and consistency needed to make fast, data-driven decisions in the new year and beyond. [...] If you want to go deeper with AI adoption this year, get a headstart with a technology foundation that has all the attributes you need. A unified, cloud-based ERP platform can centralize data, standardize processes, and provide the scalability needed for AI to work consistently and effectively across all functions. Having this foundation in place helps ensure that AI isn’t limited to isolated pilots and instead becomes a core engine for growth.\n\n## 2. Harness real-time decision-making to move at the speed of opportunity\n\nIn fast-moving markets, opportunities come and go in the blink of an eye. For companies defined by rapid expansion, the ability to make fast, informed decisions via real-time data can be the difference between sustaining momentum and stalling out. [...] It’s no secret that AI has already fundamentally changed business. Organizations of all sizes and across all sectors are using AI tools to improve productivity and efficiency. But scaling AI more broadly and for deeper gains is a different story. A report published by Accenture in September shows that 66% of C-suite leaders say AI adoption is moving faster than expected. The same percentage credit AI with boosting resilience but also acknowledge that their companies are no better prepared than at the beginning of the year. Why? For quickly growing companies, part of the challenge with effectively scaling AI for maximum impact is that they’re outgrowing their data, processes, and infrastructure faster than they can evolve them—and AI is only as effective as the foundation it’s built upon.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Now Part 2 goes where most programs struggle: change management - including how to enable frontline managers to confidently handle human-in-the-loop responsibilities (reviewing AI output, validating key facts, and owning final decisions). In 2026, AI in HR has moved beyond pilots; organizations are wiring AI into everyday SuccessFactors workflows through Joule and embedded capabilities. The teams that win won’t be the ones that merely “turn on” AI - they’ll be the ones that treat adoption as a product: clear outcomes, clear boundaries, and a manager-led reinforcement model.\n\n## What you’ll get in this blog\n\n## 0) A quick reality check: what changed in 2026\n\nAI in SuccessFactors typically shows up in three layers: [...] |  |  |  |  |\n ---  --- |\n| Dimension | Metric | Description | Pilot target example |\n| Adoption | Active Joule users (7/30 days) | Unique users issuing AI queries in a given window | 40–60% of pilot |\n| Adoption | Repeat users | Users active in at least 3 weeks out of 4 | Upward trend weekly |\n| Value | Ticket deflection | Reduction in HR support tickets for “how do I” topics | 10–25% reduction |\n| Value | Time-to-complete | Median completion time for 3–5 frequent transactions | 20–40% reduction |\n| Trust | Confidence / sentiment score | Pulse: “I understand what is safe and I trust boundaries” | &gt;75% favorable |\n| Safety | Permission boundary incidents | Escalations about access/scope issues | Flat or decreasing | [...] |  |  |  |\n --- \n| Manager responsibility | What to do (simple rule) | When to escalate |\n| Review AI output | Scan for tone, relevance, and missing context before sharing or approving. | If output is inappropriate, biased, or unsafe. |\n| Validate key facts | For policy/process answers: verify against the official source link before acting. | If the answer conflicts with policy or local legal guidance. |\n| Own the final decision | Use AI as input; document your reasoning when decisions impact people (hiring, promotion, termination, pay). | If the use case resembles automated decisioning or creates legal/compliance risk. |\n| Use “minimum necessary” data | Don’t paste sensitive personal data into prompts; keep prompts task-focused. | If users request AI to analyze highly sensitive cases. |&quot;,

What we found reveals both huge momentum and a massive opportunity most organizations are missing.\n\nThe key finding of our research: 85% of employees say AI is already helping them save time. But nearly 40% of that time is being spent reviewing, fixing, and reworking AI outputs.\n\n&gt; Nearly 2 weeks of time per employee per year is lost to checking and re-working AI outputs.\n\nReport\n\n### Workday Global Workforce Report: Restoring Trust Before Your Top People Leave\n\nRead Now [...] 1. Update the roles  \n In 89% of organizations, fewer than half of roles have been updated to reflect AI capabilities. That means people are still being managed as if the work never changed.\n\nThe opportunity is to move from rigid structures to an organization focused on collaboration and connection, where AI handles routine tasks and people focus on what matters most: driving value for customers.\n\n2. Close the training gap  \n While 39% of leaders have increased technology spending, only 30% have increased investment in workforce development.\n\nReal ROI happens when your tech strategy and your people strategy move together.\n\n3.

AI and the New Logic of M&amp;A ​\n\nAI is transforming M&amp;A by redefining deal motives, valuation, and industry evolution. Companies increasingly pursue acquisitions for talent, technology, and new business models, while deal teams grapple with how to price AI capabilities — premium assets or standard baselines. This shift introduces unique risks and integration challenges, influencing the entire M&amp;A lifecycle and challenging traditional assumptions about future deal-making.​\n\nThis panel is designed for dealmakers, strategists, and innovators looking to understand how AI is not only influencing M&amp;A but reshaping the strategic logic behind it.\n\nSpeakers: [...] AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability.

While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;#### 3. Unlock new growth markets\n\nHospitality companies should prioritize market expansion strategies that take advantage of demographic and socioeconomic trends, new travel patterns, and brand amplification.\n\n#### 4. Achieve breakthrough efficiency by becoming a predictive enterprise\n\nHospitality companies should consider accelerating AI adoption to automate tasks, enable employees to enhance the customer experience, and respond to shifting guest needs. From the back office to the guest suite, automation and prediction are becoming essential tools to enhance profitability and guest satisfaction.\n\n#### 5. Operate responsibly—it’s a core value\n\nConsumers, regulators, and investors expect hospitality businesses to operate transparently, legally, ethically, and with integrity. [...] ##### The workforce dilemma\n\nOperational stability in the hospitality industry is under pressure as labor markets tighten and staff expectations evolve. Even though inflation has pushed wages higher, recruitment remains agonizingly slow. One hospitality analysis shows that employment recovery sits at roughly 88% of 2019 levels, yet payroll costs are at record highs. In response, some hoteliers are narrowing their operations, favoring streamlined, select‑service formats—offering only essential amenities. [...] In places like Los Angeles, policies like a $30 minimum hourly wage for hospitality workers is driving talk of hotel operators closing restaurants or converting to self-service food operations. And these pressures aren’t limited to frontline roles: Hotels are leaning on technology to help teams work smarter, with 81% of hoteliers prioritizing increasing employee productivity and 49% listing integrating AI-powered solutions as priority tech initiatives.\n\n### Six imperatives for hospitality companies to consider\n\nThe days when scale alone guaranteed success are fading in the hospitality industry. Operators should tailor their offerings to meet shifting traveler profiles and stand out in a highly fragmented market.&quot;,

Human–AI chemistry refers to designing AI systems where humans retain control over critical decisions, guide AI behavior, and intervene when needed–ensuring accountability as AI takes on a greater scope.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Once an eligible user enables it, Personal Intelligence can work across Web, Android, and iOS with any model available in the Gemini model Picker. To turn it on, open Gemini, click Settings, then Personal Intelligence, and select Connected Apps. It is only available for personal Google accounts, not for workspace business, enterprise, or education plans.

In these instances, collecting user feedback is especially important.\n\nAlso: Gemini vs. Copilot: I compared the AI tools on 7 everyday tasks, and there&#x27;s a clear winner\n\nAlso, if it makes an incorrect assumption -- for example, that you are still in a relationship because of the photos in your library, or that you like golf when you&#x27;re really just there to support a friend -- you can correct it via chat with a simple clarifying statement.&quot;,

I&#x27;ve already covered most of its features, so here&#x27;s the short version: It all depends on how often you use ChatGPT and whether early access to new tools matters to you. If you only use it occasionally and don&#x27;t care about testing the latest features first, the Free plan is absolutely the way to go.\n\nYou should use free ChatGPT if…\n\n### 1. You don&#x27;t want to pay a monthly fee\n\nIf you only need occasional AI help and don&#x27;t mind limitations, the Free tier should serve you well. It&#x27;s surprisingly capable and now includes features that were once paywalled, such as Deep Research. You get a lot for $0. [...] ## You should use ChatGPT Pro if…\n\nOK, so now that we&#x27;ve discussed why Plus is worth it for many, let&#x27;s look at the more expensive Pro plan that costs $200 a month. Most people would never pay a car payment&#x27;s worth of money to use AI, but there are special instances where it could be worth it. Let&#x27;s be clear, though: Pro is for the most hard-core users who need the maximum ChatGPT experience.\n\nYou should use ChatGPT Pro if…\n\n### 1. You want ChatGPT Plus on an even greater scale\n\nAll the perks and features included in ChatGPT Plus are also available in ChatGPT Pro, but with significantly fewer limits. Pro also adds several exclusive capabilities, such as Pulse. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the biggest benefits if you&#x27;re seriously considering the upgrade:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Advanced predictive scaling policy using custom metrics ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;`LoadForecast`\n\nWe strongly recommend that you configure predictive scaling in forecast only mode so that you\ncan evaluate the forecast before predictive scaling starts actively scaling.\n\n## Limitations\n\nYou can query data points of up to 10 metrics in one metric specification.\n\nFor the purposes of this limit, one expression counts as one metric.\n\n## Troubleshooting a predictive scaling policy with custom metrics\n\nIf an issue occurs while using custom metrics, we recommend that you do the following: [...] The following section contains best practices and examples of how to construct the JSON structure for the\npolicy.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo add custom metrics to your predictive scaling policy, you must have\n`cloudwatch:GetMetricData` permissions.\n\n`cloudwatch:GetMetricData`\n\nTo specify your own metrics instead of the metrics that AWS provides, you must first publish your\nmetrics to CloudWatch. For more information, see Publishing custom metrics\nin the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. [...] The most useful metric for the scaling metric specification to scale by is an average\nthroughput or utilization per task metric.\n\nThe target utilization must match the type of scaling metric. For a policy configuration that\nuses CPU utilization, this is a target percentage, for example.\n\nIf these recommendations are not followed, the forecasted future values of the time series\nwill probably be incorrect. To validate that the data is correct, you can view the forecasted\nvalues in the console. Alternatively, after you create your predictive scaling policy, inspect\nthe `LoadForecast` objects returned by a call to the GetPredictiveScalingForecast API.\n\n`LoadForecast`&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Opportunities and challenges for HR in the age on generative AI: Nearly 75% of surveyed companies by the World Economic Forum are expected to adopt generative AI. Mercer&#x27;s global Talent Trend study also highlights that executives&#x27; top priorities include redesigning work for agility which will require them to re-design their HR function.\n Human-centric approach: David emphasises the importance of being \&quot;digital\&quot; rather than just \&quot;doing digital.\&quot; HR should focus on understanding the needs of employees and aligning technology to enhance their experience and productivity. [...] Jared Cameron, Principal Digital HR and Technology, Mercer New Zealand, said that in just 12 months, generative AI has become part of everyday work for many organisations and highlighted that the use cases for AI in HR go well beyond efficiency gains from writing job descriptions. As we dial up the complexity of what AI can do, he sees potential for more personalised learning and better insights into employee experience. But to leverage AI companies will need a strong foundation with data on talent skills, careers and job architecture.\n 44:49 - The audience makes their bet\n 50:40 - Questions from the audience\n\n### \n\nResources [...] Top\n\n### Episode 8: The impact of generative AI on HR and the workforce\n\n27 min | June 2023\n\n#### Guest:\n\nIlya Bonic  \n President, Career, Mercer\n\n### \n\nIn this captivating episode, our host Cynthia Cottrell asks Ilya Bonic, the President of Mercer&#x27;s Workforce Solutions business and Head of Mercer Strategy globally, a thought-provoking question: \&quot;Do you think AI will ever replace your job?\&quot; This question sets the stage for the conversation as they delve into the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, exploring its impact on the present and future of work.\n\nTheir conversation covers:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI is everywhere, but nowhere in recent productivity data&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“A lot of generative AI stuff isn&#x27;t really working,” Gownder said. “I mean, enterprise, and I&#x27;m not just talking about your consumer experience, which has its own gaps, but the MIT study that suggested that 95 percent of all generative AI projects are not yielding a tangible P&amp;L benefit. So no actual ROI. McKinsey has something like 80-something percent that don&#x27;t. It is just further context that says we&#x27;re not at a place where lots and lots of people are losing their jobs right now.”\n\nIn calls with more than 200 organizations Gownder said researchers found that some of last year’s large-scale job cuts were belt-tightening decisions, not the result of shifting work to AI.

P. Gownder remains unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.\n\n“Where we are today, we&#x27;re not seeing it,” he told The Register in an interview this week. [...] Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics and generative AI.\n\nGownder believes jobs that AI takes won’t come back, as typically with job losses after economic rebounds.\n\n“These jobs are lost structurally, like they&#x27;re gone for good, because they&#x27;ve been replaced. That&#x27;s not an insignificant hit to the economy,” he said.&quot;,

Yet for as much as we all desire certainty, AI has introduced a tremendous amount of uncertainty into the workspace. This again underscores the importance of resilience, rather than doubling down on role clarity. [...] To navigate the challenges facing today’s organizations, especially those related to AI, the project-management toolset is less effective. Dealing with uncertainty is better with a management tool modeled after products, with goals and teams closer aligned to outcomes — even if it means less control, less clarity around responsibilities and if it makes personal performance evaluations harder.\n\nThis is especially imperative for organizations trying to create something novel, which requires diverse perspectives and a degree of productive friction. Rigid roles rarely generate anything new, which is why resilience must become a core capability for organizations.\n\n## Managing uncertainty&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;As AI Investments Surge, CEOs Take the Lead on Decision ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives that question the status quo and spark change. BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting, technology and design, and corporate and digital ventures. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, fueled by the goal of helping our clients thrive and enabling them to make the world a better place. [...] The survey points to a set of actions that will matter most as CEOs steer their organizations through the next phase of AI:\n\n Make AI your key priority. Position the organization to be the disruptor, not the disrupted.\n Deepen AI literacy. Expand individual AI fluency to effectively lead transformations.\n Commit investments at scale. Invest decisively across end-to-end business functions.\n Upskill the organization. Upskill the workforce to optimize productivity, creativity, and judgment.\n Expect measurable ROI from AI. Track AI’s impact to drive sustainable ROI over time. [...] “Despite economic uncertainty, this anticipated surge in spending reflects how much of a priority AI has become in the business world,” said Christoph Schweizer, BCG’s CEO and coauthor of the report. “AI is no longer confined to IT or innovation teams—it’s reshaping strategy and operations from the top down with CEOs taking a leading role. Nearly three-quarters of CEOs say they are now the main decision makers on AI, and half believe their jobs depend on it.”\n\nThese are among the findings of the third annual study of the state of the global AI landscape from Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Titled,\nBCG AI Radar 2026: As AI Investments Surge, CEOs Take the Lead\n, the report is based on a survey of 2,360 executives across 16 markets and nine industries, including 640 CEOs.&quot;,

The data is presented as four separate unit charts, each representing a distinct institution: employer, universities, large tech companies, and start-ups. Each unit chart consists of a 10x10 matrix of squares. The number of light blue squares within each grid represents the percentage of employees who express high trust in each institution. The remaining squares are light gray. Employers receive the highest level of trust (71 percent), followed by universities (67 percent), large tech companies (61 percent), and start-ups (51 percent).

Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit).&quot;,

But many businesses, especially those in highly regulated sectors, hold sensitive data that needs to stay on-premise. Balancing compute efficiency with data privacy and compliance controls is a constant challenge – and can be a significant hurdle to getting real business value from agentic AI.\nIn the best cases, these challenges slow down time-to-value. In the worst, they derail it completely. The planned business benefits fail to materialize, and it takes even longer for AI to gain necessary trust. A new kind of HR challenge The challenges of agentic AI are familiar to anyone who has led the implementation of advanced data-driven systems and solutions. But there is a unique AI flavor that the HR challenge illuminates. [...] Consider cloud and mobile. These technologies made business life easier by assisting human workers. But agentic AI is closer to a virtual human being. It isn’t just helping out; it acts independently based on the authority delegated to it. It could be doing existing tasks much faster, or taking on brand new roles that humans cannot do. Monitoring and governance take on new significance. Just as the human workforce needs an HR framework that sets out expectations, roles, and responsibilities in the workplace, so AI agents need a governance and control structure to manage their activity to proactively avoid security, compliance, or ethical risks.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Agentic AI shatters traditional capacity barriers\n\n### The “10× bank”—where one person manages an AI team to deliver exponential impact—is coming into focus.\n\n### The big picture\n\nAI is transforming how banks operate, serve customers and build software. Capacity no longer depends on headcount—banks can now amplify impact with small teams directing digital co-workers. The future of work is about designing roles, workflows and cultures where humans and machines achieve more together.\n\n### What’s going on [...] #### Expose the bank’s brand in new channels\n\nTo stay visible, invest in partner APIs and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) to integrate your brand into GPTs, message platforms or wearables.\n\n#### Prepare for a product manufacturer role\n\nCompete as a best-in-class \&quot;execution engine\&quot; for standardized products, while keeping control over complex advice-heavy product experiences.\n\n#### Earn the front door by building “life event” ecosystems\n\nUse AI to facilitate big life experiences like buying a home. Let your bank’s brand stand out by becoming known as the easy place to do complex things.\n\nTREND 3: The future of work and talent\n\n## Agentic AI shatters traditional capacity barriers [...] #### Redesign work around business intents, not roles\n\nLeading banks adopt intent-driven workflows based on business outcomes and customer needs where AI agents handle routine work and humans focus on complex cases.\n\n#### Rewire HR to build an AI-ready workforce\n\nHR’s mandate includes enabling a collaborative human-AI workforce. This means building advanced and expert AI skills and nurturing a culture of curiosity and co-learning.\n\n#### Establish AgentOps to scale AI responsibly\n\nBanks need a dedicated AgentOps function to oversee deployment, performance and governance of AI agents, serving as a control tower for effective AI integration.\n\nTREND 4: The future of technology\n\n## The high cost of low cost\n\n### The future of technology is moving from keeping systems alive to powering growth.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI deployment accelerates despite risks: KPMG | HR Dive&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and Workday are among tech giants that began launching agents last year, promising the next stage of enterprise automation.\n\nBig Four accounting firms such as KPMG and Deloitte have quickly jumped on the band wagon as well, offering their own agentic AI solutions for customers.\n\nAmong the enterprises now using agentic AI, many are taking a balanced, strategic approach, according to the results of the KPMG survey.\n\nNearly half of leaders (46%) said they were focused on efficiency and revenue growth as it relates to their AI agent strategies, according to KPMG’s report. Meanwhile, leader concerns about data privacy, regulatory issues and data quality are at their highest in three quarters, the report said. [...] ### Dive Insight:\n\nThe still nascent technology continues to pose implementation challenges, KPMG said. The primary obstacles to agent deployment include technical skills gaps, workforce resistance to change and system complexity, according to a report on the findings.\n\nGartner predicts that more than 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027, due to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls. [...] About one-third of organizations have advanced to full-scale deployment of agentic artificial intelligence technology, up three-fold after two consecutive quarters at 11%, according to a KPMG study released Thursday.\n Fifty-seven percent of surveyed organizations are piloting agents, down from 65%, and 10% are exploring the possibility of using them, compared to 25% last quarter, the Big Four accounting firm found.\n “The data shows just how quickly AI agents are moving out of pilots and into production — and that momentum will only accelerate,” Steve Chase, KPMG’s vice chair of AI and digital innovation, said in a press release. “What makes this moment unique is that leaders increasingly see agents not just as a way to cut costs, but as a way to rethink growth and create new value.”&quot;,

All rights reserved.\n12 The Evolution of HR Welcome to the era of “Digital Labour” , where automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are redefining – and in many cases, replacing – jobs across all industries. Although filled with promise, this technological revolution presents many challenges for HR departments, not the least of which is the need to modify workforce strategies, adopt new systems and processes, refresh recruitment and branding strategies, and manage the potential displacement of labour – all while keeping employee and client privacy in mind. [...] The HR transformation has been a long time in the making. In recent years, it has been accelerated by workforce trends (e.g. telecommuting and mobile workforces) and generational challenges. It has also incorporated the rapid advancement of automation, cognitive processing and artificial intelligence (AI).

As AI, quantum computing and immersive technologies converge, a new form of the internet is emerging, one that is agentic, immersive and hyper-personalized. This evolution fosters a web where autonomous agents interact seamlessly with users and other digital entities, and data is used in new ways.\n\nAttendees will gain insight into:\n\n How ‘the next generation of the internet’ will be reshaped by emerging technologies.\n The impact of this transformation on digital identity, authenticity and human agency.\n The wider impact on our economy, public services and society. [...] This roundtable explores how global organizations, tech giants, and emerging AI innovation ecosystems can balance sovereignty requirements with global AI operating realities. It aims to identify where independence is essential, where collaboration remains strategically smart, and how to avoid new lock-ins while building resilient, multi-provider AI platforms. Ultimately, the discussion will examine pragmatic, sovereign-yet-global strategies and strategic partnerships across the AI stack to secure long-term competitive advantage, while still enabling global-scale innovation and enterprise value creation.​\n\n​Speakers: Microsoft, SAP, Mistral, Google​\n\nModerators:\n\n Rene Vader\n Hendrik Thorner​\n\n## Related content\n\n## Agentic AI advantage: Unlocking next-level value&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;In what was once a sleepy applications space, ERP is being reimagined with agentic AI capabilities,\&quot; is how John Van Decker, a distinguished analyst at Dresner Advisory Services, explained the change. He said agentic AI&#x27;s ability to prioritize tasks and interact with applications across finance, supply chain and HR ecosystems -- and to continuously improve through feedback and learning -- transforms ERP \&quot;from a set of software tools into an intelligent workforce.\&quot;                  \n\nRelated:What CIOs should know about rare earths\n\n## The shift: From passive tools to proactive agents [...] Software Platforms\n Software &amp; Services\n Machine Learning &amp; AI\n Commentary\n\n# 8 CIO recommendations for ERP implementation in 2026: Think agentic\n\nAgentic AI is changing ERP into an intelligent workforce in 2026. Engage vendors early, think through how humans and agents will work together, and establish a risk mitigation framework.\n\nMyles Suer, CIO Analyst and Tech Journalist\n\nJanuary 14, 2026\n\n4 Min Read\n\nAleksey Funtap via Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) suites have long underpinned global business operations. Their purpose has been to codify best practices, optimize business processes, improve data management and support informed decision-making. Agentic AI, however, creates an opportunity to rethink how an ERP implementation supports core business capabilities. [...] ## The shift: From passive tools to proactive agents\n\nSince the rise of the modern enterprise, people have managed core business processes across finance, supply chain and manufacturing. Management theorist Gary Hamel has observed that many of the processes still in use today were originally designed during the early Industrial Revolution. Now, many tasks that humans have performed for more than a century -- and which were later embedded within ERP implementations -- are shifting to agentic AI. Here, agents will increasingly take on work across finance and planning, supply chain management and procurement, manufacturing, HR and customer service.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] Lucia Rahilly: Jorge, welcome to McKinsey Talks Talent.\n\nJorge Amar: Thank you very much. Excited to be here.\n\nLucia Rahilly: Jorge, there was a great little piece in The Wall Street Journal called “Everyone’s talking about AI agents. Barely anyone knows what they are.” What exactly do we mean when we talk about agentic AI?\n\nJorge Amar: I’ll start where I think most people still are, which is generative AI. Gen AI is mostly a reactive type of AI focused on generating creative content, triggered by a prompt or an instruction from an individual.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI explained: Video series | McKinsey\n\nSkip to main content\n\nAgentic AI explained: When machines don’t just chat, but act\n\nPrint\n\nSave\n\n# Agentic AI explained: When machines don’t just chat, but act\n\n| Article\n\nPrint\n\nSave\n\nThree McKinsey experts explain how agentic AI could reshape workflows, decision-making, and how humans and machines collaborate.\n\nAgentic AI—the latest wave of artificial intelligence—doesn’t just generate text or code. It takes action. Whereas early large language models (LLMs) could answer questions or summarize information, agentic systems can now perform complex tasks independently, autonomously trigger workflows, and collaborate with other agents.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] Michael Chui: In any organization, you have different people specializing in different things. When we look toward the agentic enterprise of the future, we can imagine AI agents that specialize in doing different things, too. You might have an agent that’s planning, for example, and you might have an agent that’s interacting with customers. You might have an agent that specializes in logistics and supply chain. The idea of an agentic mesh is that you’ll need some sort of technological substrate so that all of these agents can coordinate and talk to each other.\n\n## How agentic AI could change day-to-day work [...] ## Balancing risk with opportunity\n\nMichael Chui: There are a lot of risks that come with AI agents, which echo the risks of AI itself. LLMs are nondeterministic; they can have a variety of outputs, and sometimes those include what we call a hallucination, or a confidently stated opinion that just isn’t true. There are also risks involved with agents interacting with customers; they may be perceived as being rude or insufficiently empathetic. And when you have different agents interacting in an agentic mesh, you can get what computer scientists call race conditions: where agents end up in a cycle that doesn’t technically work.&quot;,

Nearly eight in ten companies report using gen AI—yet, paradoxically, just as many report no significant bottom-line impact. Now, with the rapid rise of agentic AI, organizations must continue to upskill their workforces, adapt their tech infrastructure, and deploy agent-specific governance mechanisms. “AI agents offer a way to break out of the gen AI paradox,” write McKinsey Senior Partners Alexander Sukharevsky, Klemens Hjartar, Lari Hämäläinen, Stéphane Bout, and coauthors. “That’s because agents have the potential to automate complex business processes—combining autonomy, planning, memory, and integration—to shift gen AI from a reactive tool to a proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator.”.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The future of agentic AI in travel and hospitality | McKinsey. # Remapping travel with agentic AI. Agentic AI could upend the travel industry. Travel and hospitality organizations should explore how agentic can help catalyze AI’s transformative potential. ##### Remapping travel with agentic AI. Given the tremendous potential of agentic AI, travel and hospitality companies are beginning to experiment with it. What does the travel industry need to know as it ponders going all in on agentic AI? A new report, *Remapping travel with agentic AI*—a collaboration between McKinsey and Skift—examines the potential for agentic AI to unleash the full value of AI in travel. Based on analysis incorporating surveys of 1,002 travelers and 86 travel executives, the report traces the digital prologue that brought the industry to this moment, details agentic AI’s transformative capabilities for both travelers and travel companies, and provides a blueprint for travel and hospitality leaders who are eager to accelerate their organizations’ agentic AI initiatives. In a survey of 86 mostly US-based travel executives conducted for this report, 26 percent of respondents say that introducing AI to their organizations has led to cost reductions in operations, 30 percent say that it’s aiding faster decision-making, 33 percent say that it’s improving customer personalization, 36 percent say that it’s enabling higher-quality outputs, and 59 percent say that it’s increasing employee productivity. Perhaps chief among these is the advent of agentic AI, a cutting-edge technology poised to revolutionize the travel industry. ## The agentic-AI-powered future of customer experience in travel. ## How agentic AI can improve travel’s internal workflows. ### Agentic AI’s value for frontline travel workers. Of the travel executives we surveyed, 90 percent say that their organizations currently use gen AI in some capacity, but 38 percent say that they’re not using agentic AI at all. Insights and lessons learned from tech adoption efforts across various industries can provide a valuable road map for travel companies that hope to initiate or accelerate their own adoption of agentic AI. Technologies such as agentic AI don’t reimagine the *why* of travel. It will be the companies that can deploy agentic AI in ways that feel authentic to both the organization and the customers it serves.&quot;,
