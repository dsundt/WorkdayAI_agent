<ul>
  <li><strong>No major Workday or agentic SaaS ecosystem news in the last 24 hours (Dec 8–9, 2025)</strong><br/>
    <p>A thorough review of headline sources shows no significant new product launches, partnerships, regulatory shifts, or analyst commentary impacting Workday's agentic or AI-enhanced SaaS solutions in the past 24 hours. Following numerous recent ecosystem developments in previous weeks, this period offers a necessary pause for both practitioners and clients to digest recent innovations. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this is a moment to double down on operationalizing recent announcements—like the unified AI agent partnership between Workday and Microsoft—and to deepen client advisement before new competitive signals re-emerge. The focus should be on reinforcing the value of existing agentic functionality and preparing for year-end strategic planning cycles. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All major HCM and agentic AI players</strong><br/>
    <p>No major ecosystem competitors, including Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG, or Dayforce, released new statements, product features, or partnerships within the last 24 hours. This stable competitive landscape gives Deloitte’s teams a tactical advantage for proactive client engagement, internal ramp-up, and thoughtful application of longer-term strategic roadmaps in anticipation of further market movements early in 2026.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Agentic Practice Readiness</strong><br/>
    <p>Teams should revisit and leverage the latest comprehensive case studies on Workday’s AI agentic capabilities, such as those compiled in <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this recent deep-dive</a>. This will prepare teams to keep clients briefed on the full value of current agentic features and best practices, maintaining Deloitte’s leadership in AI-powered solution adoption by Workday customers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue active monitoring for any updates on agentic AI, HCM SaaS, or governance from major players (Workday, Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG, Dayforce).</li>
  <li>Consolidate analyses from 2025 ecosystem changes for client advisement and innovation sessions.</li>
  <li>Prepare team briefings or client updates that summarize the competitive steady state, outlining opportunities and reinforcing Deloitte's advisory strengths.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> No current news could prompt organizational complacency.<br/>
    <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Maintain engagement with scenario planning, regular review of recent innovations, and forward-focused client consultation on agentic SaaS evolution.</li>
</ul>

Deloitte and Workday teams should maintain awareness, but no immediate action or strategic shifts are required.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;No major Workday or agentic SaaS ecosystem news in the last 24 hours\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A comprehensive scan of vetted sources revealed no noteworthy product announcements, partnerships, analyst commentary, or competitive developments impacting Workday&#x27;s agentic or AI-powered enterprise solutions within the window from 2025-12-08T06:39 to 2025-12-09T06:39 ET. This absence of updates may be indicative of a stabilization period following a series of major launches and partnership announcements in previous weeks, including ecosystem expansions and advances in AI agent frameworks from both Workday and its competitors.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this lull presents an opportunity to both consolidate learnings from recent innovations and ensure readiness as the market digests prior announcements—such as Workday&#x27;s unified agent experience with Microsoft or UKG’s Bryte AI advancements. Importantly, practitioners should continue to monitor signals in adjacent risk, governance, and responsible AI news, as well as prepare for renewed activity leading into 2026 planning cycles.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Worker-bee AGI: Why AWS is betting on practical agents ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AgentCore emerged as one of the most pivotal announcements of the week because it represents the scaffolding required to make agents production-grade. Bedrock has steadily matured into the foundational abstraction layer for model access, but AgentCore sits alongside it as the operational backbone for multi-agent systems. It is the control infrastructure that governs how agents behave, how they coordinate and how they remain within defined boundaries. [...] AgentCore begins to fill this gap. It establishes the governance fabric that agents must operate within and provides the layer into which downstream capabilities – systems of intelligence and systems of agency – will ultimately connect. It is the early architecture of agent-native operations, and AWS appears intent on owning this part of the stack.\n\n### Nova Forge: Perhaps the most important announcement of the week [...] Kiro, first announced at the AWS Summit in New York, took on new significance last week. Anyone who still believes AWS is behind in AI need only look at the cadence and depth of innovations emerging around Kiro and its autonomous coding capabilities. Despite that, the keynote significantly understated its importance, in our view. Developers we spoke with emphasized that Kiro is quickly becoming central to their workflows. And the reason is that Kiro goes beyond the vibe-coding paradigm that has&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;IDC estimates that more than one billion new logical applications will emerge by 2028( reshaping technology architectures across industries. To fuel meaningful outcomes and drive productivity in operations, these applications, as well as AI agents, need access to connected and trusted data – in real time. IBM and Confluent will enable end-to-end integration of applications, analytics, data systems and AI agents to drive intelligence and resilience in hybrid cloud environments. [...] “IBM and Confluent together will enable enterprises to deploy generative and agentic AI better and faster by providing trusted communication and data flow between environments, applications and APIs. Data is spread across public and private clouds, datacenters and countless technology providers,” said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. “With the acquisition of Confluent, IBM will provide the smart data platform for enterprise IT, purpose-built for AI.” [...] “Since its founding, Confluent has helped organizations unlock the full potential of their data, driving innovation in an increasingly complex IT landscape. We are extremely proud of the work we’ve done in providing clients with a real-time data streaming platform for the next era of technology, including generative and agentic AI,” said Jay Kreps, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Confluent. “We are excited by the potential to join IBM and to accelerate our strategy with IBM’s go-to-market expertise, global&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How to Improve Your AI with Agent and Application ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agent and application lifecycle management (ALM) provides a structured way to manage the journey of an AI agent or application, from ideation to deployment. ALM helps IT and development teams navigate complexity, ensuring a consistent, speedy, and secure way to build, test, and deploy new AI agents and applications across the organization.\n\nA modern, trusted ALM framework is built around five core stages: [...] 1. Ideate &amp; plan: Defining requirements, setting business goals, and establishing compliance and security standards before a single line of code is written.\n2. Build: Developing the application or AI agent using low-code, pro-code, and AI-assisted tools (like Generative AI for code).\n3. Test: Verifying for functionality, performance, and security in isolated, production-like environments.\n4. Deploy: Consistently and securely moving validated code and configurations into production. [...] AI agents and apps are inherently dynamic. They continuously learn, adapt, and iterate based on new data, user interactions, and changing business conditions. On top of that, the security and regulations landscape is ever-evolving. In order to adhere to key regulations, it can be too late to wait months, or even weeks, to release a new update.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;workday is AE, then (I didn&#x27;t know that)  \n   \n I believe we would only say a working day for a day when you you choose or are assigned to work (if you don&#x27;t have a standard Mon-Fri work assignment).  \n   \n Next week Saturday is a working day (or workday) for me, so I can&#x27;t play golf then. Si j&#x27;ai bien compris l&#x27;exemple donné par staarkali, ça pourrait être l&#x27;équivalent de jour ouvré. [...] I also say workday, for jour ouvrable, though I don&#x27;t mind working day. But jour ouvrable suivant = next business day. I thik business day is mostly used for commerce and finance.   \n   \n Now - as already suggested - there is a difference to be made between jour ouvré and jour ouvrable.   \n   \n As found in the GDT, under jour ouvrable  \n&gt; Définition :  \n&gt;  Jour de la semaine qui est normalement consacré au travail ou aux activités professionnelles et qui n&#x27;est pas un jour férié. [...] Well the link clears up this debate for me, which I had until now not clearly understood  \n   \n jour ouvré in AE is business day, vs jour ouvrable, workday  \n   \n The other thread gives the example of receiving a ticket after x jours ouvrés (càd sans compter les samedis, dimanches ou autres jours fériés). In AE we would say \&quot;your ticket will be sent x business days after it is ordered.\&quot; (i.e., not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays)\n\n#### Nicomon\n\n##### Senior Member&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally. A working day could be the same as that, but is perhaps more often used for the hours of the day you&#x27;re at work. If something happens during the working day, it happens between 9 and 5.30 or whenever. My working day was busy yesterday.\n\nS\n\n#### sasmith\n\n##### Member\n\nBritish English\n\n #5 [...] Dictionaries say that \&quot;workday\&quot; is AE and \&quot;working day\&quot; is BE.\n\n#### velisarius\n\n##### Senior Member\n\nGreece\n\nBritish English (Sussex)\n\n #12\n\nI think one of the most common uses for \&quot;working day\&quot; in BE is this:  \n   \n The bill must be paid within 10 working days (not counting Saturdays and Sundays and bank holidays).\n\n#### Roxxxannne\n\n##### Senior Member\n\nAmerican English (New England and NYC)\n\n #13 [...] Similar, although what I think the previous poster was getting an, was that &#x27;the working day&#x27; can be used as an encompassing term to describe the time you&#x27;re at work, not so much as a specific classification of 9-5 or whatever.   \n   \n If you know any French, it&#x27;s somewhat similar to the distinction between &#x27;jour&#x27; and &#x27;journée&#x27; - one relating to a specific day, the other relating to that general period of time/duration.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;Our partnership with Workday is a breakthrough in delivering the trust organizations need to adopt AI,\&quot; said Charles Lamanna, president, business and industry Copilot, Microsoft. \&quot;By seamlessly registering agents built with Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry into Workday&#x27;s Agent System of Record, we&#x27;re giving customers full visibility into their AI ecosystem. This integration equips leaders with actionable analytics to measure ROI, enforce governance, and ensure their AI agents are secure and [...] Enhance Human-Agent Collaboration: The new integration between Workday and Microsoft&#x27;s agent systems will allow seamless interoperability between different AI agents. For example, an employee could ask a Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot to update career goals or submit a peer review. The request would be handed off to the Workday agent inline, allowing the employee to complete the workflow in Workday agent without leaving Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent. [...] SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday Rising 2025 -- Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents, today announced a new collaboration with Microsoft to help organizations securely manage their people and AI agents across their platforms. Customers that build AI agents using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio will be able to easily register and manage them within the Workday Agent System of Record (ASOR). This&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Lamanna, who has led the Power Platform initiative since its inception, said the integration into Copilot marks a fundamental shift in how these capabilities reach users. Rather than requiring workers to visit a separate website or learn a specialized interface, the development tools now exist within the same conversational window they already use for AI-assisted tasks. [...] The integration offers significant technical advantages, he argued. Because Copilot already indexes a user&#x27;s Microsoft 365 content — emails, documents, meetings, and organizational data — it can incorporate that context into the applications and workflows it builds. If a user asks for \&quot;an app for Project Spartan,\&quot; Copilot can draw from existing communications to understand what that project entails and suggest relevant features. [...] The new features transform Copilot from a conversational assistant into what Microsoft envisions as a comprehensive development environment accessible to non-technical workers. Users can now describe an application they need — such as a project tracker with dashboards and task assignments — and Copilot will generate a working app complete with a database backend, user interface, and security controls.&quot;,

This is where AI becomes not a replacement for human judgment, but the very thing that enables managers to deliver what employees need to stay engaged at work: timely, personalized, and equitable feedback centered on their growth. [...] By adopting AI for performance feedback, HR leaders are doing more than just modernizing a system—they are building a human-centric workplace where every employee receives the specific support they need to grow, where trust is built on fairness, and where talent strategy directly contributes to measurable business success.

This investment into personalization directly fuels business performance and value.\n\n### Enabling the Manager-as-Coach\n\nFor HR leaders and managers looking to leverage AI in this transformation, the change is less about the technology and more about the mindset shift it enables.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI bias can stem from flawed data, algorithmic design and human judgment, leading to outcomes that may perpetuate societal inequalities.\n Mitigating AI bias requires a human-centric approach: conducting data audits, re-evaluating algorithms and grounding decisions in societal contexts.\n Long-term solutions include continuous monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and aligning AI outcomes with ethical principles and societal wellbeing. [...] #### Understanding and mitigating bias in AI systems is critical to fostering fairness, promoting responsible AI practices and driving equitable societal outcomes.\n\n##### In brief [...] Bias in AI systems poses serious challenges that can lead to unfair treatment and systemic discrimination. To combat these issues, organizations must implement strategies like data audits and algorithm testing, while fostering collaboration and public awareness.

It&#x27;s about fostering a culture of self-awareness and continuous improvement, where everyone feels equipped to meet the challenges of the future. [...] AI offers more than just efficiency. It offers a chance to reclaim work for the human spirit. It&#x27;s about unlocking our potential to focus on what truly matters: finding meaning, building relationships, and making a real impact.\n\nImagine a workplace where AI handles the mundane, freeing us to pursue work that nourishes our souls, that connects us to a larger purpose. It&#x27;s not just about doing work, but about finding our why in the work we do. [...] The goal is to create a culture of continuous development, where employees feel valued, supported, and inspired to learn and grow.

Workday has denied the allegations, asserting that its technology is designed to promote fairness [...] December 08, 2025 - As artificial intelligence transforms employment and dispute resolution, mediators face the challenge of engaging with technology while preserving the essence of human connection. [...] Behind every claim of algorithmic bias stands a person who feels unseen. Mediation gives them a voice. Behind every corporate defense stands a team that believed it was innovating responsibly. Mediation gives them understanding.\n\nAs technology grows more complex, the mediator&#x27;s task remains the same: to create the space where humanity, empathy, and reason can meet. In that space, even disputes born of AI can find authentically human resolutions.&quot;,

The question this attendee asks himself is: “What’s the minimum I have to do in order to gain value?” [...] Enhance operations, boost efficiency, remove technical debt and modernize apps for the future.\n\nConnect your processes, people and insights across the enterprise with AI-enabled IPA.\n\nAI-powered business processes for the modern enterprise.\n\nScalable and efficient cloud solutions for business transformation.\n\nEnterprise-grade acceleration: The last mile advantage for AI.\n\nTurn big visions into practical realities with expertise that takes you further.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is an important moment for organisations willing to embrace the AI opportunity. The inference here is that many may not. “Most businesses have done digitization in the past; few businesses have done true process digital transformation,” argued one attendee. He noted that many firms “lift and shift” existing processes and applications when moving from analogue to digital. He offered creating a PDF facsimile of a paper-based form by way of example. [...] Decision making must match an organization’s risk appetite and, suggested one attendee, there is always room for maneouvre. While the old adage, “don&#x27;t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness”, doesn’t quite apply here, a willingness to work at the edges of compliance is certainly an option for some. The question this attendee asks himself is: “What’s the minimum I have to do in order to gain value?” [...] Enhance operations, boost efficiency, remove technical debt and modernize apps for the future.\n\nConnect your processes, people and insights across the enterprise with AI-enabled IPA.\n\nAI-powered business processes for the modern enterprise.\n\nScalable and efficient cloud solutions for business transformation.\n\nEnterprise-grade acceleration: The last mile advantage for AI.\n\nTurn big visions into practical realities with expertise that takes you further.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is an important moment for organisations willing to embrace the AI opportunity. The inference here is that many may not. “Most businesses have done digitization in the past; few businesses have done true process digital transformation,” argued one attendee. He noted that many firms “lift and shift” existing processes and applications when moving from analogue to digital. He offered creating a PDF facsimile of a paper-based form by way of example. [...] Decision making must match an organization’s risk appetite and, suggested one attendee, there is always room for maneouvre. While the old adage, “don&#x27;t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness”, doesn’t quite apply here, a willingness to work at the edges of compliance is certainly an option for some.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agent and application lifecycle management (ALM) provides a structured way to manage the journey of an AI agent or application, from ideation to deployment. ALM helps IT and development teams navigate complexity, ensuring a consistent, speedy, and secure way to build, test, and deploy new AI agents and applications across the organization.\n\nA modern, trusted ALM framework is built around five core stages: [...] Building dynamic AI goes hand-in-hand with sandboxes. By creating a copy of your production environment, teams can build, test, and refine new features, code, and integrations — all without affecting live data and operations. And, when working with AI agents, the quality and realism of your test environment are critical for building trust. [...] 1. Ideate &amp; plan: Defining requirements, setting business goals, and establishing compliance and security standards before a single line of code is written.\n2. Build: Developing the application or AI agent using low-code, pro-code, and AI-assisted tools (like Generative AI for code).\n3. Test: Verifying for functionality, performance, and security in isolated, production-like environments.\n4. Deploy: Consistently and securely moving validated code and configurations into production.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Simple conversational interfaces are rapidly giving way to agentic AI – autonomous systems that are capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating across siloed business functions. The Digital Enterprise 2025 report notes that 27% of companies already have AI agents in production or at scale, with another 31% in proof-of-concept stages. [...] For executives, this shift represents a profound opportunity to engage with business intelligence in new ways. Instead of asking “What happened?” (a dashboard function), executives can focus on “What should we do next?” (an autonomous action).\n\nImagine an ecosystem where dedicated AI agents don’t just communicate with users, but also with each other, grounded in a single source of truth. [...] The convergence of agentic AI and Tableau’s governance framework enables Indian enterprises to move faster and with greater confidence than ever. Executives can responsibly balance AI agility with enterprise data accountability.\n\n## The mandate for modern CXOs\n\nWe’re moving past the AI experimentation phase into the AI deployment phase. Enterprise analytics in the future will be all about  intelligent agents collaborating and reasoning, not just reporting facts.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI churn has IT rebuilding tech stacks every 90 days - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The survey results suggest that widespread deployment of AI agents may still be years away, Northcutt says. He predicts the estimated 1% of organizations with agents in production will rise to 3% or 4% in 2027, with true agents in production reaching 30% of enterprises in 2030.\n\nHe believes AI agents will lead to major benefits, but he urges evangelists to cut back their rhetoric in the meantime. [...] Just 28% of respondents are satisfied with the agent security and guardrails they have in place, signaling a lack of trust in agent results.\n\nWhile the Cleanlab survey may paint a bleak picture of the current state of agents, several AI experts say its conclusions appear accurate.\n\nJeff Fettes, CEO of AI-based CX provider Laivly, isn’t surprised that many enterprises rebuild part of their agent stacks every few months. He sees a similar phenomenon. [...] “We can now use AI to get better at our jobs, but the whole idea of enterprise AI automating everything and agents in every product, it’s coming,” he says. “If we can just kind of keep it cool, guys, and set reasonable expectations, then all this money invested might actually play out.”\n\n## Related content\n\n### Get data, and the data culture, ready for AI\n\n### Building sovereignty at speed in 2026: Why CIOs must establish AI and data foundations in 120 days&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is now essential, and at Microsoft Ignite 2025, we introduced a new foundation for intelligent agents: Work IQ, Fabric IQ, and Foundry IQ. These three IQs represent the intelligence layer that gives agents deep context; understanding how people work, connecting to enterprise data, and orchestrating knowledge across platforms. Together with the launch of Microsoft Agent Factory, organizations now have a unified program to build, deploy, and manage agents powered by these IQs. [...] Whether you’re just starting with AI or scaling enterprise-wide adoption, the Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan empowers you to unlock the full value of Microsoft’s agentic platform—driving innovation, efficiency, and business impact.

By leveraging open standards like A2A, the enterprise is moving away from monolithic vendor platforms and toward a vibrant, decentralized marketplace of agentic services. In this future state, enterprises will gain access to specialized, hyper-optimized capabilities from a wide array of providers, treating every compute, data, or AI service&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agent and application lifecycle management (ALM) provides a structured way to manage the journey of an AI agent or application, from ideation to deployment. ALM helps IT and development teams navigate complexity, ensuring a consistent, speedy, and secure way to build, test, and deploy new AI agents and applications across the organization.\n\nA modern, trusted ALM framework is built around five core stages: [...] Historically, traditional enterprise apps were static and predictable. Once deployed, they followed established rules and workflows, remaining stable until the next major update. Now, with AI, the maintenance schedule has shifted from periodic, major releases to an accelerated, continuous update cycle. [...] 1. Ideate &amp; plan: Defining requirements, setting business goals, and establishing compliance and security standards before a single line of code is written.\n2. Build: Developing the application or AI agent using low-code, pro-code, and AI-assisted tools (like Generative AI for code).\n3. Test: Verifying for functionality, performance, and security in isolated, production-like environments.\n4. Deploy: Consistently and securely moving validated code and configurations into production.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To scale fast with digital labor, reMarkable turned to Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Agentforce 360 Platform. The company launched Mark, an AI customer service agent that now handles 37% of support cases and matches human agents in customer satisfaction. For internal teams, a second agent, Saga, engages with employees directly in Slack to handle IT requests like onboarding and troubleshooting, freeing up the IT team for higher-value work.\n\n## Tips for Success [...] As they expanded the agent&#x27;s access to more knowledge, these improvements became even more critical to delivering fast, accurate answers.\n\nTakeaway\n\nDon&#x27;t assume your data is ready. Audit and restructure it so it&#x27;s clear and usable for humans and AI. Good data powers great results.\n\n## Tip 3: Define a clear scope but give your agent room to reason. [...] As reMarkable’s business grew, their small teams were stretched thin trying to support increasing customer and employee needs. With more than 27,000 monthly customer service cases and rising enterprise demand, their fully human support model became unsustainable. And internally, their fast-growing workforce overwhelmed the IT team with repetitive requests.&quot;,

[...] The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems. Connecting agents to tools and data traditionally requires a custom integration for each pairing, creating fragmentation and duplicated effort that makes it difficult to scale truly connected systems. MCP provides a universal protocol — developers implement MCP once in their agent and it unlocks an entire ecosystem of integrations. [...] Others described experiencing less interaction with colleagues. Some appreciate the reduced social friction, but others resist the change or miss the older way of working: \&quot;I like working with people and it is sad that I &#x27;need&#x27; them less now.\&quot;\n\n## How Anthropic stacks up against OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in the enterprise AI race&quot;,

Once they have been given a goal, they identify the best way to achieve that goal, and initiate the relevant tasks involved. [...] However, this digital workforce requires rigorous governance to preserve your finance controls.

In August, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the vast majority of organizations saw zero return on their investment in generative AI initiatives. The next month, researchers at Harvard and Stanford universities determined that professionals are using AI to create “workslop,” which they define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but [...] Employees in industries such as data science, engineering and communications, as well as certain roles like accounting, reported some of the most time saved from using AI, according to OpenAI’s survey of 9,000 workers across 100 companies. Three quarters of employees said that using AI at work has improved either the speed or quality of their output, the survey found. [...] OpenAI now has more than 1 million businesses paying to use its enterprise AI products. There are now 7 million paid seats, or employees, for ChatGPT workplace products, according to the report.&quot;,

[...] Her team of more than 80 were invited by the company to champion AI adoption within the whole business, she says. All the legal team were trained in using generative AI and now more than 100 AI agents for use by the legal team are at some stage of development, Anderson adds. Several legal processes have been speeded up, including work on patents and contract review. [...] So far the early adopters have reported incremental changes rather than dramatic transformation. But they are experimenting and expanding uses for the tech, while also figuring out questions such as how to keep human wisdom in the mix, build in safeguards and train staff in a new range of skills.&quot;,

Investors are looking for companies to increase their investments in upskilling their employees, which could well lead to the kind of productivity gains that investors expect.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One method that’s seeing success within PwC – and for many of our clients – is a skills-first approach to recruitment, where people are hired based on their abilities rather than their formal qualifications or work history. We have provided analysis to support the World Economic Forum in its report, Putting Skills First: Opportunities for Building Efficient and Equitable Labour Markets. [...] PwC’s 2024 Global Workforce Hopes and Fears survey shows that many young people aged 18 to 25 are ready to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) – with 70% saying Generative AI (GenAI) gives them opportunities to expand their capabilities.\n PwC’s AI Jobs Barometer suggests AI skills boost productivity and value, leading to a 25% wage premium. To benefit, workers must develop the necessary skills as AI rapidly changes required competencies. [...] Let’s look at the opportunities AI presents. PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer reveals that the sectors that are deploying AI the fastest – the likes of professional services, financial services, and technology – are achieving productivity growth five times faster than the sectors that are making less use of AI. In addition, workers who have AI skills can command up to a 25% wage premium.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;PwC surveyed more than 54,000 workers in 46 countries and territories and found workers are largely positive about AI despite the job churn it represents.\n\n\&quot;They see it as something that enables them to be more productive, to remove some of the mundane in their day-to-day work, an opportunity to develop new skills and, ultimately, an opportunity to create new job opportunities,\&quot; added Brown. [...] In the survey, more than 50% of workers chose at least one positive statement about the impact of AI on their careers, from increasing productivity to helping them gain new skills. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said: \&quot;AI will help me increase my productivity/efficiency at work.\&quot;\n\nThe majority of workers are positive about the impact of AI on their careers. Image: PwC [...] At the Forum&#x27;s Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China, PwC presented the results of its survey in a session called The Global Workforce.\n\n\&quot;What the workers tell us is they are wanting to embrace the opportunity to upskill, to develop themselves, to be relevant, to be able to be more productive and to contribute to that reinvention of their organizations,\&quot; said Peter Brown, PwC Global People and Organization Leader.\n\nLoading...&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Jan 28, 2025 · Artificial intelligence ( AI ) transforms companies’ ability to apply intelligence, creating opportunities for innovative business models and new value pools. Recent research by PwC suggests that these benefits do not come at the expense of jobs. The responsibility for developing much-needed AI skills should be shared by organizations, policy-makers, educators and employees themselves.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business&quot;,

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Met AI-agents krijgt iedereen de kans om leiderschap te ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## AI Synopsis\n\nAI verschilt wezenlijk van eerdere technologische revoluties, omdat het meer doet dan informatie beschikbaar maken. Het kan samenvatten, redeneren, analyseren, beslissingen nemen en taken uitvoeren, werk dat voorheen volledig bij mensen lag.\n\nHierdoor kan iedereen zijn skills aanscherpen. Zoals McKinsey opmerkt: ‘AI neemt barrières weg. Hierdoor kunnen meer mensen in meer vakgebieden vaardig worden, altijd en in elke taal.’ [...] De risico’s wegen ruimschoots op tegen de kansen. Uiteindelijk gaat het bij de agentische organisatie om een nieuwe type menselijk potentieel.\n\nZoals Schwartz al uitlegde, hebben alle medewerkers nu een persoonlijke assistent die ‘het leven en werk een stukje gemakkelijker maken’. Het resultaat? Een wereld waarin individuen zoveel meer kunnen bereiken dan vroeger en niet alleen bij specifieke taken, maar door echt een verschil te maken in het bedrijf. [...] # Met AI-agents krijgt iedereen de kans om leiderschap te tonen\n\nDe agentische organisatie en de voorafgaande revoluties\n\nDe eenvoud van AI is de sleutel tot succes\n\nWat er nu allemaal verandert\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Zijn er nadelen aan het feit dat alle informatie voor iedereen toegankelijk is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nBij de agentische organisatie draait alles om een nieuw type menselijk potentieel\n\n## Met meer toegang tot intelligentie en de vrijheid om die te gebruiken, ontgroeien medewerkers hun functietitel.&quot;,
