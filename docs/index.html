<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No significant Workday ecosystem updates in the last 24 hours (Dec 29–30)</strong><br />
    <p>A comprehensive review across <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s official newsroom</a>, product blog, analyst coverage, and competitive intelligence sources reveals no major news stories, product updates, or emergent risks directly affecting the Workday HCM, Extend, Skills Cloud, AI Marketplace, or agentic AI agenda in the 24-hour window ending December 30, 2025, at 06:40 ET. This period of steadiness follows a flurry of mid-December ecosystem announcements, including recent GSI showcases and analyst year-end predictions for agentic AI growth, but does not introduce new strategic vectors or operational urgencies for customers or Deloitte’s advisory teams.</p>
    <p>This pause affords Deloitte and Workday clients a valuable opportunity to focus on execution, internal upskilling around existing Workday AI programs, and proactive engagement with responsible AI best practices. It also acts as a signal for readiness: year-end and early Q1 are historically periods rich with both product releases and evolving client needs. Monitoring continues for any new leadership updates, patent disclosures, or competitive threats—particularly as agentic AI penetration accelerates within HR tech and enterprise SaaS in 2026.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul><li>No material moves or announcements from SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, or key GSIs in the past 24 hours affecting the Workday ecosystem.</li></ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Agentic AI fundamentals for the enterprise</strong><br />
    <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Agentic AI? (Workday)</a><br />
    <em>90-day outcome:</em> Build fluency in Workday’s agentic AI definitions, operating models, and the differences between basic automation and autonomous agent strategies, so that client conversations are grounded in thought leadership and aligned with latest roadmap terminology.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Responsible AI best practices for Workday deployments</strong><br />
    <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-practices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Practices (Workday)</a><br />
    <em>90-day outcome:</em> Enhance Deloitte team capability to advise on governance, risk, and compliance within Workday AI projects—supporting clients in meeting ESG, legal, and ethical mandates and reducing implementation risk.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stay alert for January Workday AI product announcements and new integration partnerships.</li>
  <li>Review and update Deloitte Workday client guidance on agentic AI capabilities per December releases.</li>
  <li>Facilitate enablement sessions using Workday’s agentic AI and responsible AI resources.</li>
  <li>Monitor competitor and GSI websites for early Q1 ecosystem launches or joint GTM activations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Lack of new information could lull teams into complacency, missing early signals of market change.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Maintain disciplined daily monitoring of official Workday and analyst channels, and conduct weekly synthesis reviews to spot early trends.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Clients may be eager for immediate AI improvements without understanding responsible AI requirements.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Embed responsible AI enablement into all client discussions, leveraging Workday’s latest governance and compliance guidance.</li>

This period of steadiness follows a flurry of mid-December ecosystem announcements, including recent GSI showcases and analyst year-end predictions for agentic AI growth, but does not introduce new strategic vectors or operational urgencies for customers or Deloitte’s advisory teams.\\n\\nThis pause affords Deloitte and Workday clients a valuable opportunity to focus on execution, internal upskilling around existing Workday AI programs, and proactive engagement with responsible AI best practices. It also acts as a signal for readiness: year-end and early Q1 are historically periods rich with both product releases and evolving client needs. Monitoring continues for any new leadership updates, patent disclosures, or competitive threats—particularly as agentic AI penetration accelerates within HR tech and enterprise SaaS in 2026. \\nSource: Workday Newsroom (https://newsroom.workday.com/)\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- No material moves or announcements from SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, or key GSIs in the past 24 hours affecting the Workday ecosystem.\\n\\nEnablement\\n- Agentic AI fundamentals for the enterprise\\n  Resource: https://www.workday.com/en-us/topics/ai/agentic-ai.html\\n  90-day outcome: Build fluency in Workday’s agentic AI definitions, operating models, and the differences between basic automation and autonomous agent strategies, so that client conversations are grounded in thought leadership and aligned with latest roadmap terminology.\\n\\n- Responsible AI best practices for Workday deployments\\n  Resource: https://www.workday.com/en-us/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-practices.html\\n  90-day outcome: Enhance Deloitte team capability to advise on governance, risk, and compliance within Workday AI projects—supporting clients in meeting ESG, legal, and ethical mandates and reducing implementation risk.\\n\\nActions for Next Week\\n- Stay alert for January Workday AI product announcements and new integration partnerships.\\n- Review and update Deloitte Workday client guidance on agentic AI capabilities per December releases.\\n- Facilitate enablement sessions using Workday’s agentic AI and responsible AI resources.\\n- Monitor competitor and GSI websites for early Q1 ecosystem launches or joint GTM activations.\\n\\nRisks &amp; Mitigations\\n- Risk: Lack of new information could lull teams into complacency, missing early signals of market change.\\n  Mitigation: Maintain disciplined daily monitoring of official Workday and analyst channels, and conduct weekly synthesis reviews to spot early trends.\\n\\n- Risk: Clients may be eager for immediate AI improvements without understanding responsible AI requirements.\\n  Mitigation: Embed responsible AI enablement into all client discussions, leveraging Workday’s latest governance and compliance guidance.\\n\\nAll Sources\\n- Workday Newsroom: https://newsroom.workday.com/\\n- What Is Agentic AI?
