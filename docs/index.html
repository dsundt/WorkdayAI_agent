<ul>
  <li><b>No significant new Workday product, partnership, or AI announcements in the last 24 hours</b> (as of Dec 15, 2025):<br>
    <p>Workday's official <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsroom</a> and verified media sources show no recent headlines, marking a quiet period after substantial agentic AI ecosystem developments earlier in Q4. This pause gives Deloitte and Workday clients an opportunity to deepen enablement, gather operational data, and prepare for anticipated 2026 advancements. The relative stability is a strong moment for assessment, value realization, and stakeholder alignment. Teams are encouraged to interpret this lull as a chance to shore up competitive posture, revisit responsible AI narratives, and as a precursor to likely early Q1 launches. Stay vigilant; prior years have seen late-December competitive surprises. <br>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Oracle expands Oracle Database@Google Cloud availability (Dec 15, 2025):</b>
    <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-at-google-cloud-is-now-available-in-india-2025-12-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle’s latest cloud expansion</a> is more about foundational cloud infrastructure than agentic HCM or SaaS-AI advances. However, its sustained multi-cloud strategy and marketplace integrations could be building blocks for future agentic workflows or data-sharing API relationships. While Oracle has not yet introduced new agent-driven HCM/ERP features this week, Deloitte should watch for cross-cloud innovation that could intersect with Workday’s Skills Cloud or AI agent extensibility. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Agentic AI developer tools on Workday Platform:</b> Consultants can deploy the <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI developer toolset</a> for rapid client prototyping, custom agent solutioning, and engagement differentiation. In 90 days, this builds in-house expertise for deeper client AI agent extensions and future custom integrations.</li>
  <li><b>Responsible AI and NIST compliance in SaaS HR:</b> Use Workday’s <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/the-new-nist-ai-framework-accelerating-trustworthy-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST AI Framework guide</a> to steer governance and compliance projects, ensuring client confidence and strategic advantage as SaaS AI regulation matures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solicit structured client feedback on new AI agent deployments and collect early post-production insights across industries.</li>
  <li>Refresh competitive matrix to anticipate year-end moves from ServiceNow, SAP, Oracle in the agentic HCM/ERP space.</li>
  <li>Deploy internal enablement sessions on Workday AI developer tools with hands-on labs using the published toolset and Partner Network.</li>
  <li>Draft client-facing materials outlining responsible AI best practices with direct mapping to the NIST Framework and Workday controls.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Risk:</b> Complacency from lack of public updates may delay client innovation or competitive readiness in agentic AI.<br><b>Mitigation:</b> Maintain proactive outreach and cross-client learning to surface emerging operational or business value from recent AI investments.</li>
  <li><b>Risk:</b> Potential for emerging AI moves by competitors (SAP, ServiceNow, Oracle) during late December to go untracked due to holiday focus.<br><b>Mitigation:</b> Sustain a rotating coverage schedule and automate daily competitive intelligence feeds to avoid gaps in monitoring.</li>
</ul>

This relative quiet may reflect both the proximity to year-end and stabilization following an active period of agentic AI rollout, including the Agent Partner Network and developer toolset launches earlier this quarter. \\n\\nFor Deloitte and clients, this stability provides a valuable but brief opportunity to consolidate learning from recent AI expansions, validate operational impacts, and recalibrate enablement strategies ahead of likely early-2026 announcements. Teams should use this interlude to deepen client outreach, reinforce Workday’s responsible AI positioning, and harvest cross-client feedback on recent Skills Cloud and agent extensibility releases. \\n\\nExpect more significant updates coinciding with annual wrap-up retrospectives or the start of Q1 2026. Meanwhile, continuous competitive monitoring remains essential as Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow have heightened AI go-to-market activity during prior late-December windows.\\n\\nReference: Workday Newsroom validates no new headlines as of December 15, 2025.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Expanded Oracle Database@Google Cloud offering to new markets, though not agentic HR HCM-specific.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s move, announced December 15, 2025, underlines its ongoing cloud diversification but does not introduce new agentic-AI HR differentiators this week. This signals a steady, not disruptive, pace in the competitive AI-HCM arms race. Deloitte practices should monitor for possible integration hooks or future cross-cloud AI workflow partnerships as Oracle’s trajectory could intersect with Workday Skills Cloud or Extend pipelines in 2026.\\n\\nSource: https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-at-google-cloud-is-now-available-in-india-2025-12-15\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI developer tools on Workday Platform\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Consultants and solution architects gain hands-on experience building and extending Workday’s AI agents for client-specific workflows, creating differentiated use cases that leverage the Agent Gateway and recently released third-party connectors, cementing Deloitte’s position as a technical thought leader with live client demonstrations.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI and NIST compliance in SaaS HR\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/the-new-nist-ai-framework-accelerating-trustworthy-ai.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Teams lead conversations with clients on responsible agentic AI deployment, aligning governance roadmaps to the NIST AI Framework and proactively mitigating reputational and regulatory risks associated with SaaS automation.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Solicit structured client feedback on new AI agent deployments and collect early post-production insights across industries.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Refresh competitive matrix to anticipate year-end moves from ServiceNow, SAP, and Oracle in the agentic HCM/ERP space.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Deploy internal enablement sessions on Workday AI developer tools with hands-on labs using the published toolset and Partner Network.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Draft client-facing materials outlining responsible AI best practices with direct mapping to the NIST Framework and Workday controls.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Complacency from lack of public updates may delay client innovation or competitive readiness in agentic AI.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Maintain proactive outreach and cross-client learning to surface emerging operational or business value from recent AI investments.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Potential for emerging AI moves by competitors (SAP, ServiceNow, Oracle) during late December to go untracked due to holiday focus.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Sustain a rotating coverage schedule and automate daily competitive intelligence feeds to avoid gaps in monitoring.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;sources\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Newsroom | WDAY Press Releases | Workday\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Unveils AI Developer Toolset, Empowering Developers to Customize and Connect AI Apps and Agents on the Workday Platform\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-06-03-Workday-Unveils-AI-Developer-Toolset,-Empowering-Developers-to-Customize-and-Connect-AI-Apps-and-Agents-on-the-Workday-Platform\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;The New NIST AI Framework: Accelerating Trustworthy AI\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/the-new-nist-ai-framework-accelerating-trustworthy-ai.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Database@Google Cloud is Now Available in India\&quot;,\n      \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-at-google-cloud-is-now-available-in-india-2025-12-15\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;html_body\&quot;: \&quot;&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No significant new Workday product, partnership, or AI announcements in the last 24 hours&lt;/b&gt; (as of Dec 15, 2025):&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Workday&#x27;s official &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\\\&quot;&gt;newsroom&lt;/a&gt; and verified media sources show no recent headlines, marking a quiet period after substantial agentic AI ecosystem developments earlier in Q4. This pause gives Deloitte and Workday clients an opportunity to deepen enablement, gather operational data, and prepare for anticipated 2026 advancements. The relative stability is a strong moment for assessment, value realization, and stakeholder alignment. Teams are encouraged to interpret this lull as a chance to shore up competitive posture, revisit responsible AI narratives, and as a precursor to likely early Q1 launches.

However, its sustained multi-cloud strategy and marketplace integrations could be building blocks for future agentic workflows or data-sharing API relationships.

This steady period allows for operational learning and client enablement post-agentic AI updates. Deloitte teams should use this opportunity to collect client feedback and reinforce responsible AI positioning. Historically, late December sometimes brings surprises from competitors, so ongoing monitoring is essential.\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- Oracle expands Oracle Database@Google Cloud (Dec 15, 2025): Oracle (https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-at-google-cloud-is-now-available-in-india-2025-12-15) is advancing its cloud range, although not with new agentic HR/HCM capabilities. The move is evolutionary, not disruptive, but teams should monitor for future AI or integration features, especially those impacting multi-cloud HR data flows between Workday and Oracle.\\n\\nEnablement\\n- Agentic AI developer tools on Workday Platform: Learn and demo the Workday AI developer toolset to build customized agent flows for clients.
