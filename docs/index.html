The pace and direction of these advancements have direct implications for Workday clients considering ecosystem agility, compliance, and next-gen HR capabilities.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Sophos Launches Workspace Protection to Secure Hybrid and Remote Work Environments (Published 2026-01-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Sophos has unveiled its Workspace Protection solution, signaling increased competition in the security space for hybrid and remote work environments—key operational models for organizations adopting platforms like Workday HCM. This new solution incorporates AI to deliver active threat response and device posture checks tailored specifically for distributed workforces. With more organizations leveraging cloud-based HR systems, safeguarding endpoints and remote connections has become a strategic necessity.\\n\\nFor Workday clients, robust cross-platform security is foundational to their digital HR infrastructures. The market’s direction, as shown by Sophos’ move, points to growing client expectations for real-time adaptive protection that integrates seamlessly with SaaS workflows. Sophos’ adoption of AI-driven adaptive defense highlights the increasing importance Workday must place on native and partner-based security solutions, especially as agentic features expand HR process automation and exposure. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, it is imperative to frame security not as an add-on, but as a co-evolving layer alongside new AI/agentic capabilities. This ensures risk mitigation evolves in lockstep with HR system innovation, and positions Deloitte as a trusted advisor for integrated, secure-by-design Workday programs.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/sophos-introduces-workspace-protection-simplify-hybrid-remote-work-security\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Docebo Acquires 365Talents to Expand AI-driven Skills Intelligence (Published 2026-01-20)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Docebo&#x27;s acquisition of 365Talents, an AI-powered skills management platform, marks a significant escalation in the battle for leadership in AI-driven skills intelligence solutions. 365Talents specializes in leveraging AI to identify, map, and match employee skills, streamlining reskilling and upskilling initiatives. This directly challenges Workday&#x27;s Skills Cloud, reinforcing that skills intelligence is becoming a core differentiator in enterprise HCM.\\n\\nThis move matters strategically for clients contemplating skills-centric talent strategies. Enterprises increasingly expect skill taxonomies, talent marketplaces, and intelligent mobility capabilities to be embedded in HR platforms—not simply as bolt-on features. As Docebo brings 365Talents’ AI-driven insights into its learning platform, the bar for holistic, end-to-end employee development experiences will rise. For Deloitte and its Workday practice, this underscores both the urgency and opportunity to define integration patterns with leading-edge AI skills engines. It also shapes advisory conversations: Deloitte teams should foreground the value of Skills Cloud’s recent enhancements, develop proactive readiness for external AI-powered skills tools, and remain engaged with the market’s rapid convergence on data-driven, autonomous skill management.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202601200630BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260120_BW961187-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;e&amp; and IBM Announce Enterprise-Grade Agentic AI Focused on Governance and Compliance (Published 2026-01-19)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IBM, in partnership with Middle East telecommunications operator e&amp;, announced a new suite of agentic AI solutions that place unparalleled focus on compliance, governance, and secure enterprise operations. The partnership harnesses IBM&#x27;s robust AI stack—including their governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) frameworks—to address the unique risk and regulatory needs of large enterprises.\\n\\nThis move positions IBM at the forefront of operationalizing responsible agentic AI in highly regulated contexts—a growing concern for global SaaS providers and their clients. The announcement signals to Workday and its ecosystem partners that the next wave of HR and business automation will hinge on transparent, auditable, and policy-aware AI. For Workday clients and Deloitte’s practice, the so what is clear: as agentic capabilities become more autonomous, the expectation for integrated governance, continuous assurance, and demonstrable compliance grows. Deloitte has an opportunity to help clients interpret these changes, assess gaps in current Workday and partner AI deployments, and preempt future regulatory mandates by embedding responsible AI best practices from the outset.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-19-e-and-ibm-unveil-enterprise-grade-agentic-AI-to-transform-governance-and-compliance\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Docebo\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Acquisition of 365Talents to bolster AI-first skills intelligence and talent mobility.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Docebo’s acquisition strengthens its market position in AI-driven skill and talent management, intensifying competition for Workday Skills Cloud. Large organizations may now have more choices for embedding AI skill mapping and reskilling tools in their HR ecosystems, which could necessitate more open integration approaches for Workday. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, this new competitive pressure means being prepared to articulate the differentiators of Workday’s Skills Cloud and advise clients on possible coexistence or integration with best-in-class external AI skills solutions.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;IBM\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Joint launch of enterprise-grade agentic AI solutions focused on governance and compliance in partnership with e&amp;.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;IBM is doubling down on responsible agentic AI, aligning its enterprise offerings with strict compliance, risk management, and regulatory needs. This strategy appeals directly to industries where robust, explainable AI is non-negotiable—overlapping with many of Workday’s key verticals.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;KPMG at the World Economic Forum in Davos&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;KPMG in collaboration with Microsoft, Mastercard and Cloudfare is discussing the agentic transformation and the multi-faceted impacts on individuals, citizens, economic structures and the roles of governments and businesses. As AI, quantum computing and immersive technologies converge, a new form of the internet is emerging, one that is agentic, immersive and hyper-personalized. This evolution fosters a web where autonomous agents interact seamlessly with users and other digital entities, and data is used in new ways.\n\nAttendees will gain insight into:\n\n How ‘the next generation of the internet’ will be reshaped by emerging technologies.\n The impact of this transformation on digital identity, authenticity and human agency.\n The wider impact on our economy, public services and society. [...] AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations. While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges. [...] This roundtable explores how global organizations, tech giants, and emerging AI innovation ecosystems can balance sovereignty requirements with global AI operating realities. It aims to identify where independence is essential, where collaboration remains strategically smart, and how to avoid new lock-ins while building resilient, multi-provider AI platforms. Ultimately, the discussion will examine pragmatic, sovereign-yet-global strategies and strategic partnerships across the AI stack to secure long-term competitive advantage, while still enabling global-scale innovation and enterprise value creation.​\n\n​Speakers: Microsoft, SAP, Mistral, Google​\n\nModerators:\n\n Rene Vader\n Hendrik Thorner​\n\n## Related content\n\n## Agentic AI advantage: Unlocking next-level value&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertical Agents, Invisible Intelligence: APAC&#x27;s Next Leap in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Insurance\n\nAustralia’s insurers are accelerating the use of agentic workflows to automate claims assessment and triage complex cases. Regionally, AI investment in insurance is expected to grow around 60% by 20276, with autonomous agents increasingly performing first-level assessment and anomaly detection.\n\n### Healthcare [...] This is why the region is moving rapidly toward data quality, governance and observability being built into the architecture rather than layered on top.\n\n## Modern iPaaS: The Foundation for Responsible Agentic Transformation\n\nModern iPaaS has become the architectural backbone for agentic AI. It is no longer just middleware or connectivity. It is the enterprise nervous system enabling:\n\n Consistent data quality and lineage\n Secure, governed API pathways\n Real-time event orchestration\n Multicloud interoperability\n Full lifecycle visibility over agent behaviour\n\nIt ensures AI agents operate with the right connections, context, and controls. Without this, autonomy becomes unpredictable, especially in high-stakes environments such as banking, healthcare, transportation, and public services. [...] Yet as vertical ecosystems multiply, integration complexity increases. The Straits Times reports that M&amp;A activity across APAC shows consolidation rising in fintech, healthcare, logistics, and digital infrastructure,8 each adding new systems and governance requirements.\n\nThis sets the stage for the second shift.\n\n## Prediction 2: Invisible, Embedded Intelligence — The Rise of Agentic Automation\n\nAgentic automation will embed itself directly into finance, HR, supply chain, healthcare, and other workflows. These agents won’t feel like standalone AI systems but like operational infrastructure that continuously orchestrates decisions behind the scenes.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Avis Budget Group is also using Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence to gain deeper analytics capabilities, drawing on data from Oracle Cloud ERP and EPM. The expansive insights and up-to-date dashboards provided by the platform help the company track key metrics around financial performance such as accounts payable processing and invoice approvals. The company also intends to take full advantage of the AI agents that Oracle currently offers and continues to develop to further reduce manual administrative work.\n\n## Partners [...] Avis Budget Group is a provider of global mobility solutions, with a fleet of more than 600,000 vehicles. To support its high rental volumes, Avis needed a better way to manage vehicle operations, planning, and maintenance. It also needed to consolidate and coordinate financial data and standardize its financial management processes globally. The company moved to Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM). In doing so, it gained greater visibility into and data around fleet vehicle purchases and associated costs—the company’s largest expense. Avis Budget also uses the embedded AI features in Oracle Fusion such as account combination defaulting, Intelligent Document Recognition, and supplier summarizations to [...] Industry background\nAvis Budget Group\n\n# Avis Budget Group gains AI-powered automation with Oracle Cloud ERP\n\nThe auto rental company uses unified Oracle Fusion apps to globally track and analyze critical business data and boost process efficiency with AI.\n\nUnited States | Travel\n\nVideo: Avis Budget Group Streamlines Global Finance with Oracle Cloud ERP (2:53)&quot;,

By enabling the world’s best scientists to move faster, we believe we can help save countless lives,” said\nEike Gerhardt, Cofounder and Chief Business Officer, Autopoiesis.\n\n## Why Autopoiesis chose Oracle\n\nAutopoiesis isn’t shy about its mission: “To define the AI-for-science era and build the most impactful company in history. By enabling the world’s best scientists to move faster, we believe we can help save countless lives,” says Eike Gerhardt, the company’s cofounder and chief business officer.\n\nAutopoiesis chose to run its “co-scientist” AI model, called Aristotle, on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for several reasons: [...] The daughter rushed to the hospital and insisted that her mother receive emergency attention. It was later discovered that without that timely action, her mother would have suffocated within 24 hours. The episode underscored for the team that developing an AI co-scientist could save countless lives in the future by helping caregivers make better decisions when the stakes are highest.\n\n## About the company\n\nAutopoiesis is a San Francisco–based startup building an AI model designed to help scientists accelerate discoveries, validate complex hypotheses, and address urgent challenges in medicine and biology.\n\nLearn more about Autopoiesis\n\n## Products list\n\n## Resources for\n\n## Why Oracle\n\n## Learn\n\n## News and Events\n\n## Contact Us [...] Industry background\nAutopoiesis\n\n# Autopoiesis taps Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to build AI “co-scientist”\n\nThe startup is developing an AI model that combines state-of-the-art reasoning with systematic doubt to accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nUnited States | Life Sciences\n\nStandard AI models are like your mother: They tend to love everything you do. Which is great if you’re a kid, but frustrating if you’re any sort of scientific researcher.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Introducing multi-agent collaboration capability for Amazon Bedrock (preview) | AWS News Blog&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation behind the scenes. By enabling agents to work together, you can achieve higher task success rates, accuracy, and enhanced productivity. In internal benchmark testing, multi-agent collaboration has shown marked improvements compared to single-agent systems for handling complex, multi-step tasks. [...] With the fully managed multi-agent collaboration capability on Amazon Bedrock, specialized agents work within their domains of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization. [...] I select the content-strategist agent and provide the collaborator name `content-strategist` along with the following instruction:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media content strategy tasks such as converting business goals into engaging social posts. The agent generates creative, on-brand content ideas that align with specified campaign goals and target audience.`\n\nThen, I choose Add collaborator, select the engagement-predictor agent, and provide the collaborator name `engagement-predictor` along with the following instructions:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media analytics to predict post performance and optimal timing.`&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Amazon Bedrock now supports multi-agent collaboration\n\nPosted on: Mar 10, 2025\n\nToday, AWS announces the general availability (GA) of multi-agent collaboration for Amazon Bedrock, allowing developers to create networks of specialized agents that communicate and coordinate under the guidance of a supervisor agent. This new capability allows you to tackle more intricate, multi-step workflows and scale your AI-driven applications more effectively. [...] This release also introduces agent monitoring and observability features, helping you track, monitor, and optimize agent interactions more efficiently. These features improve debugging and traceability, ensuring better visibility into agent workflows and making troubleshooting easier for developers.\n\nMulti-agent collaboration on Amazon Bedrock is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported. To learn more about this feature and how it can help you build more sophisticated AI applications, see the Amazon Bedrock product page or refer to the documentation for detailed information on getting started. [...] Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration GA introduces key enhancements designed to improve scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency. Inline Agents allow you to dynamically adjust agent roles and behaviors at runtime, making workflows more adaptable as your business needs evolve. With Payload Referencing, supervisor agents can reference linked data instead of embedding it in every request, reducing data transfer, improving response times, and lowering operational costs. Additionally, multi-agent now offers CloudFormation (CFN) and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) support so you can create reusable teams of agents as templates that can be shared across accounts within an organization.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock, customers can get more accurate results by creating and assigning specialized agents for specific steps of a project and accelerate tasks by orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel,” AWS said.\n\nCustomers build their specialized agents on Bedrock, and then make a supervisor or orchestrator agent to help manage the other agents. AWS said the supervisor agent “handles the coordination, like breaking up and routing tasks to the right agents, giving specific agents access to the information they need to complete their work and determining what actions can be processed in parallel.” [...] AWS first introduced agentic capabilities in 2023 with the release of Agents on Bedrock, which offered enterprises a way to start building agents. During its re:Invent event this week, AWS customers like PagerDuty and GitLab announced new agents that let users develop their applications on their platforms and use AWS agents to enhance their workflows.\n\n## Multiple agents becoming the norm [...] All Posts\n\n# AWS brings multi-agent orchestration to Bedrock\n\nEmilia David\n\nAWS is doubling down on AI agents with the announcement of multiagent capabilities on its Amazon Bedrock platform.\n\nDuring his keynote at the AWS re:Invent conference, AWS CEO Matt Garman said customers building agents on Bedrock wanted a means to make agents that work together.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;&gt; “_With AgentCore, we can easily develop and test our solutions using different Python frameworks, giving us flexibility and faster experimentation,_” said Xihui Wang, Reply Data Scientist. “_The built-in gateway enables us to securely integrate Lambda functions as tools while also making them reusable across multiple agents. In addition, AgentCore provides built-in memory management, observability, and identity services, which reduce development overhead and simplify scaling to production._“ [...] Reply partnered with Totemia to develop an Offer Agent built on Strands SDK and hosted on AgentCore Runtime. The solution leverages AgentCore Gateway to invoke AWS Lambda functions generating dynamic SQL queries via Amazon Bedrock foundation models (Anthropic Claude) based on client criteria. These functions connect to Amazon RDS to fetch real-time offers and return the top 5 matches. AgentCore Memory enables multi-turn conversations, refining recommendations based on previous interactions. When no exact match exists, the agent proactively suggests adjusting criteria through iterative refinement. AgentCore Identity via Amazon Cognito provides authentication, while AgentCore Observability tracks performance and reliability. [...] AgentCore’s ready-to-use building blocks eliminated custom infrastructure development, enabling Reply to move from prototyping to production rapidly. The agent narrows results from 60 to 5-10 tailored recommendations, achieving 65% reduced search time, 40% increased bookings, 24/7 availability, 25% conversion growth, and supporting 30,000 users monthly—projecting 200-300% ROI within year one.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese early-adopter success stories demonstrate how AWS Partners are capitalizing on AgentCore to deliver transformative value across industries – from financial services to travel, security to banking. As enterprise demand for AI agents accelerates, AgentCore enables partners to rapidly scale production-ready solutions while maintaining enterprise-grade security and performance.&quot;,

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below.&quot;,

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below. [...] it will likely be slow and selective. Overall, areas such as digital assets, operational resilience, and AI will likely attract more, not less, oversight.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Supervisors will expect AI use in TS to be governed as a material risk, with clear accountability, explainable decisions, and robust evidence of positive customer outcomes. This will require strong data governance, proactive bias detection, transparent disclosure of AI use to retail investors, and access to a human advisor where concerns arise. Ongoing effective model testing and continuous monitoring will also be essential to ensure AI systems can identify vulnerable customers and respond effectively to changing circumstances. See our AI and data op-ed for further details. [...] Source: ESMA, data correct as of 12/11/20254\n\nAll firms will need to consider how innovation can support offerings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be a key enabler in delivering TS, particularly through data analysis, market segmentation, and scaling personalised content for investors. In parallel, firms must understand and manage the risks AI exacerbates – including data and algorithmic bias – that could lead to investor harm. [...] ##### Endnotes&quot;,

Nonetheless, Workday (and HiredScore, prior to Workday’s acquisition of HiredScore) routinely conducts bias testing of its AI products that have the potential to significantly impact individuals’ economic opportunities. While Workday engaged an external consultant to conduct the bias testing of the Spotlight AI tool using the impact ratio approach as described in the NYC Law, the purpose of this testing is in furtherance of Workday/HiredScore’s commitments to identify and mitigate potential bias. Customers may need to conduct their own evaluation, testing and/or bias audits depending on their legal obligations. [...] HiredScore’s explainable AI outputs report to what extent a candidate’s application matches the job requirements using a simple A, B, C, D system, where A denotes the highest match between a candidate’s application and an employer-defined job requisition. Put another way, the technology acts like a “smart mirror” reflecting back the extent to which candidates fit the job requirements set by the employer. The A, B, C, D scores are never “curved.” This means that if a job requisition has commonly held requirements, there may be many more As and Bs than Cs and Ds. Conversely, if a job requisition has very uncommonly held requirements, there may be many more Cs and Ds than As and Bs, and each candidate will receive a score indicating how they align with the requirements; this score is [...] Designing and building responsible AI that our customers can trust and adopt in line with their legal compliance obligations has been part of HiredScore’s mission statement since the beginning.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Given that Workday’s 24 R2 release is scheduled for September 2024, it should just barely make its own timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle Cloud HCM made a clear announcement regarding its generative AI plans and use cases in June 2023. As of its first release in 2024, Oracle Cloud HCM customers have had access to embedded generative AI functionality that help customers improve decision making and enhance the employee experience. These include knowledgebase articles, job postings, performance feedback and development tips, and review summaries. It also includes many use cases that Workday has not announced on its roadmap, like a candidate experience summary, job category landing pages, and job match explanations. [...] Then co-CEO Carl Eschenbach first discussed preliminary plans for generative AI in March 2023. Workday’s generative AI use cases were clarified at Workday Rising in September 2023, talking about functionality such as job descriptions and employee growth plans. Plans for availability were set for 6-12 months from the event, or between March and September 2024. As of March 2024, Workday confirmed that there were three HCM use cases in an early adopter program as of its 24 R1 release, with none scheduled for general availability until the 24 R2 release or later. Workday subsequently put a fourth HCM use case into early adopter program during its DevCon 2024 event, with no clear plans for general availability. [...] Overall, Workday only has 25 generative AI use cases on its roadmap, while Oracle Fusion Applications have 50+ embedded use cases.\n\nThe innovation comparison is substantial. While Oracle Cloud HCM customers are benefiting from increased productivity, Workday users are made to wait.\n\n## 4. Deliver a personalized and meaningful experience to every employee&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird. [...] Entscheidend ist: Die Kontrolle bleibt stets bei unseren Kunden. Hiring Manager und Recruiting-Teams entscheiden selbst, wie sie KI-gestützte Erkenntnisse nutzen. Dieser menschenzentrierte Ansatz ist bewusst gewählt. Er stellt sicher, dass Technologie verantwortungsvoll, transparent und mit Respekt gegenüber Bewerbenden wie Arbeitgebern eingesetzt wird.\n\n## Unabhängig geprüft, weltweit anerkannt\n\nWorkday verlangt kein blindes Vertrauen. Unser Rahmenwerk für verantwortungsvolle KI wurde freiwillig einer strengen, unabhängigen Prüfung durch Dritte unterzogen und an international anerkannte Standards angepasst. [...] Seit vielen Jahren verfolgt Workday einen proaktiven, unternehmensweiten Ansatz für verantwortungsvolle KI. Dieses Engagement reicht von der Produktentwicklung über Governance-Strukturen bis hin zu operativen Prozessen. Dahinter steht eine klare Haltung: Vertrauen muss eingebaut werden. Es lässt sich nicht im Nachhinein ergänzen.\n\n## Menschenzentriert von Grund auf\n\nWorkday unterstützt Organisationen dabei, ihre wichtigsten Ressourcen zu steuern. Ihre Menschen und ihre Finanzen. Von Recruiting und Gehaltsabrechnung über Workforce Planning bis hin zu Buchhaltung und darüber hinaus. Diese Verantwortung nehmen wir seit dem ersten Tag ernst. Entsprechend entwickeln wir Technologien, die auf Vertrauen, Wirksamkeit und Verantwortlichkeit ausgelegt sind.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Financial Services\n\nSingapore’s MAS continues to set the region’s benchmark for responsible AI, emphasising fairness, explainability, and auditable decisioning.5 But this shift extends well beyond Singapore. Philippine banks are adopting AI to strengthen fraud detection and credit scoring. Malaysian financial institutions are modernising under Bank Negara’s risk governance standards. Globally, PwC estimates banking AI spend is projected to rise from US$6B in 2024 to about US$85B by 2030, and AI could generate US$2T in new banking value by 2028, increasing profitability by ~9% for early adopters.6\n\n### Insurance [...] Boomi AI  Lead agentic transformation\n Boomi Agentstudio  Design, govern and orchestrate AI agents\n AI Agents  Deploy AI agents for rapid automation\n Boomi MCP  Deliver agent-ready tools with enterprise governance\n Responsible AI  Enterprise-grade security and governance for agentic transformation\n\nAll Connectors Boomi for SAP    Oracle NetSuite\n\nExplore Boomi Marketplace Connect Any Application Connect with NetSuite Connect with Snowflake Connect with ChatGPT Connect with ServiceNow Connect with Shopify Connect with Google Drive Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Boomi [...] MIT’s “State of AI in Business 2025” found that 95% of organisations struggle to generate meaningful ROI from AI, largely due to weak data foundations and integration gaps. The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations. While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

The same product with the same features is now called Customer Experience Insights, or CX Insights for short.\n\nDataplex\n\nBreaking [...] Document AI\n\nFeature\n\nDocument AI is introducing document-level prompting for custom document processors. This feature allows you to provide an overall description of the document to inject deep business knowledge into the model, leading to improved extraction quality.\n\nDocument-level prompting offers improved accuracy by giving the model necessary context for extraction at the document level. This allows for easily supplied general information, such as geographical limitations (for example, _all the address fields are located in the USA_), to guide the model.\n\nFor more details, refer to the documentation on custom extractor mechanisms and document-level prompting.\n\nGemini Enterprise\n\nAnnouncement\n\nAgent Designer is generally available (GA).\n\nGoogle SecOps\n\nFeature [...] Dataflow\n\nFeature\n\nDataflow now serves a notice for when the Dataflow Runner v2 container image of a streaming pipeline will be upgraded. To use a new image and avoid the scheduled maintenance, launch a replacement job before the upgrade. For more information, see Runner v2 harness update.\n\nDataproc\n\nAnnouncement\n\nDataproc on Compute Engine: The following subminor image versions announced on January 06, 2026 have been rolled back:\n\n   2.0.156-debian10, 2.0.156-ubuntu18, 2.0.156-rocky8\n   2.1.105-debian11, 2.1.105-ubuntu20, 2.1.105-ubuntu20-arm, 2.1.105-rocky8\n   2.2.73-debian12, 2.2.73-ubuntu22, 2.2.73-ubuntu22-arm, 2.2.73-rocky9\n   2.3.20-debian12, 2.3.20-ml-ubuntu22, 2.3.20-rocky9, 2.3.20-ubuntu22, 2.3.20-ubuntu22-arm\n\nGenerative AI on Vertex AI\n\nFeature&quot;,

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk. Healthcare and financial services, two of the most regulated industries in APAC, continue to highlight gaps in AI guardrails, auditability, and real-time oversight.9 When AI is embedded deeply and silently, trust cannot be an afterthought.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit \n\nImage 9: Employee segments differ, but all indicate a high familiarity with gen AI.\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. [...] Image description ends.\n\n### Leaders can invest more in their employees\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in _Superagency_. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit). [...] AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations. While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges.

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Asia: Q4&#x27;25 Venture Pulse Report&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI remained a central focus for VC investment in Asia during Q3’25, with China attracting the largest share of capital. The quarter’s biggest raises included GLP ($348 million), a data center infrastructure developer, and MiniMax AI ($300 million), which specializes in text-to-video AI. In addition, smartphone-focused AI agent developer Z.ai secured $139 million, underscoring the diversity of AI applications gaining traction in China. [...] ## Deal volume remains subdued — except for D+ rounds\n\nDeal volume in Asia has been quite subdued this year, with numbers well off pace of 2024’s totals across most deal stages at the end of Q3’25. D+ deals were the exception, with deal volume well-positioned to see a modest increase year-over-year should trends continue through Q4’25, although average deal value was substantially lower. The increase in deal volume likely reflects the rapid maturation of startups in Asia — particularly in areas like AI and deeptech, and in jurisdictions like Japan, India, and Indonesia — and the growing number of companies raising later funding rounds. [...] Standout raises this quarter included Newmo (¥17.9B), and Terra Charge (¥10.4B). Hot sectors continue to be AI, healthcare, energy, space, and mobility, though polarization is clear: proven companies and large VC funds are thriving, while smaller funds and weaker startups face bigger hurdles.\n\n## Trends to watch for in Q4’25\n\nHeading into Q4’25, VC investment in Asia will likely remain subdued, particularly in China where economic recovery is expected to take some time. AI and deeptech will likely remain a top priority for investors across the region, in addition to areas like health and biotech.&quot;,

Microsoft Teams와 같은 커뮤니케이션 플랫폼과도 통합됩니다.\n\nWorkday의 새로운 글로벌 인재 동향 및 채용 트렌드 리포트에 의하면, AI 기반의 채용 어시스턴트 기능은 적합한 인재 발견이 점점 더 힘들어질 때 특히 진가를 발휘합니다.\n\n새로운 Expenses 에이전트는 AI를 활용하여 경비보고서를 자동으로 생성하고 제출합니다. 이를테면 출장 중인 직원이 조식 결제를 완료하는 즉시 영수증을 업로드하라는 문자 메시지를 받습니다. 그러면 시스템에서 영수증을 신용카드 거래와 매칭하여 자동으로 경비 라인을 생성합니다.\n\nSuccession 에이전트는 조직 차원에서 미래의 리더를 찾고 성장시키도록 돕습니다. 매니저가 승계 계획을 업데이트하도록 미리 알려주고, 조직의 전 범위에서 승계자를 자동으로 추천하고, 핵심 인재를 위한 맞춤형 개발 계획을 만들어 다음에 맡을 역할을 준비할 수 있게 합니다.\n\n마지막으로 Optimize 에이전트는 Workday의 비즈니스 프로세스를 능률화합니다. 병목 지점, 비효율성, 모범 사례와의 차이점을 밝혀냅니다. 이를테면 온보딩 프로세스의 문제점(예: 수동 데이터 입력, 순서가 맞지 않는 단계)에 자동으로 플래그를 지정하고 해결할 수 있습니다. [...] Bhusri는 기술 업계가 AI를 둘러싼 장밋빛 전망의 정점을 지나고 있으며 &#x27;AI가 실질적인 비즈니스 가치를 제공하는 것이 관건&#x27;임을 인정했습니다. Workday는 10여 년 전부터 AI에 투자하면서 생성형 AI 기능, Workday Extend 내 AI Gateway, Workday AI 마켓플레이스 등을 내놓았습니다.\n\nWorkday Illuminate는 Workday가 진행 중인 AI 로드맵이 진일보한 결과이며, 현실의 다양한 시나리오에서 그 가치를 발휘할 것입니다.\n\nBhusri는 AI가 매니저 경험을 혁신하는, 즉, 매니저가 팀에서 최고의 인재를 빠르게 발견하고 성장시키도록 지원하는 HR 환경에 관해 설명했습니다.\n\n그는 청중에게 모든 비즈니스 트랜잭션의 생성, 검증, 회계 처리가 사실상 비대면으로 이루어지고 계정이 셀프 조정되는 환경을 상상해 보라고 말했습니다.\n\n또한 Workday의 지난 화요일 발표에 의하면, Workday는 대표적인 AI 기반 문서 인텔리전스 플랫폼, Evisort를 인수하기 위한 최종 계약을 체결했습니다. Workday는 Evisort를 통해 HR 및 재무 제품군의 전 범위에서 AI 기반 문서 인텔리전스 솔루션을 추가할 계획입니다.\n\n## Workday Illuminate 탐구\n\nAI가 계속해서 기술 업계의 최대 관심사로 자리잡은 가운데, 진실과 과장을 구분하기가 쉽지 않습니다. AI/머신러닝 부문 VP, Shane Luke는 Workday가 진정한 가치 제공에 집중한다고 거듭 강조했습니다.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Do AI agents replace human workers or just assist them?\n\nOur AI agents are designed to augment human workers, not replace them. We take responsible AI seriously, holding ISO 42001 accreditation and independent attestation of alignment with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. The primary goal of Workday agents is to free your people to focus on higher-value work, such as strategic analysis and complex problem-solving, where human skills are most impactful.\n\n### Are AI agents available out of the box in Workday or fully customizable? [...] ### How can I be sure I’m getting value from AI agents?\n\nWorkday Agent System of Record provides deep agent analytics and clear visibility into the ROI you’re getting from each agent. This ensures you have the data to prioritize the AI capabilities that are delivering the most value.\n\n### What steps should companies take to get started with AI agents?\n\nStart by identifying high-impact business processes or employee friction points where agents can add the most value. Next, enable existing AI features you already have through Workday to complement and enhance agent capabilities. Finally, prepare your organization by equipping your workforce to interact with AI, including developing new skills, adapting workflows, and fostering a culture of collaboration with AI agents.

AI-driven workforce transformation is further accelerating the need for reskilling, while pathways to skilled global talent are narrowing due to immigration restrictions, H-1B visa policy changes, and expected work authorization delays. Domestic education-to-employment pipelines also remain insufficient, leaving gaps in the talent supply.&quot;,

They will need a clear, actionable risk appetite for AI, setting boundaries on where it can be used, acceptable levels of autonomy, and how outcomes are monitored and tested. Effective oversight depends on knowing where AI is deployed, the materiality of each use case, and how performance, incidents and limitations are reported. Boards will need reliable management information on AI performance and risks, and the ability to challenge assumptions, test management confidence, and ensure that AI remains within risk tolerances. They must also be confident that executives can act decisively when issues arise, with clear escalation routes, defined responsibilities, robust controls, and credible plans for pausing AI systems if necessary. [...] Responsibility for AI governance across FS remains uneven, with some exceptions.Oversight is often driven by first line functions or led by Chief Data Officers or Chief Information Officers, whose focus naturally leans towards technical performance. This can mean regulatory and risk considerations receive less attention than they should. More effective models distribute governance across technology, risk and compliance, ensuring a balanced view of performance, safety and regulatory obligations. While accountability may sit in different parts of the organisation depending on each firm’s structure, those accountable should ensure that AI risks are managed in line with regulatory expectations and agreed risk tolerances.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below. [...] Despite regional differences, regulators globally share a common goal: to foster innovation without diluting risk-based oversight. The core principle is that new capabilities, including Generative or agentic AI, must not override sound risk management. Firms can adopt AI quickly, provided they invest in essential capabilities and safeguards: a clear risk appetite, strong internal controls, robust risk management, and, crucially, accountability for outcomes.\n\n#### Operational resilience – efficiency meets reality&quot;,

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk. Healthcare and financial services, two of the most regulated industries in APAC, continue to highlight gaps in AI guardrails, auditability, and real-time oversight.9 When AI is embedded deeply and silently, trust cannot be an afterthought.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations. While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Asia: Q4&#x27;25 Venture Pulse Report&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI remained a central focus for VC investment in Asia during Q3’25, with China attracting the largest share of capital. The quarter’s biggest raises included GLP ($348 million), a data center infrastructure developer, and MiniMax AI ($300 million), which specializes in text-to-video AI. In addition, smartphone-focused AI agent developer Z.ai secured $139 million, underscoring the diversity of AI applications gaining traction in China. [...] ## Deal volume remains subdued — except for D+ rounds\n\nDeal volume in Asia has been quite subdued this year, with numbers well off pace of 2024’s totals across most deal stages at the end of Q3’25. D+ deals were the exception, with deal volume well-positioned to see a modest increase year-over-year should trends continue through Q4’25, although average deal value was substantially lower. The increase in deal volume likely reflects the rapid maturation of startups in Asia — particularly in areas like AI and deeptech, and in jurisdictions like Japan, India, and Indonesia — and the growing number of companies raising later funding rounds. [...] Standout raises this quarter included Newmo (¥17.9B), and Terra Charge (¥10.4B). Hot sectors continue to be AI, healthcare, energy, space, and mobility, though polarization is clear: proven companies and large VC funds are thriving, while smaller funds and weaker startups face bigger hurdles.\n\n## Trends to watch for in Q4’25\n\nHeading into Q4’25, VC investment in Asia will likely remain subdued, particularly in China where economic recovery is expected to take some time. AI and deeptech will likely remain a top priority for investors across the region, in addition to areas like health and biotech.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk. Healthcare and financial services, two of the most regulated industries in APAC, continue to highlight gaps in AI guardrails, auditability, and real-time oversight.9 When AI is embedded deeply and silently, trust cannot be an afterthought.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Rise and Fall of the American Monoculture&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For most of the 20th century, they were also the glue that held the country together. In a sprawling nation founded on the precept of individual liberty and populated primarily by immigrants from around the world, there was hardly one American experience. Maids in Boston, factory workers in Chicago and farmers in California lived much different lives despite being part of the same country.\n\nCinemas, radios, television sets and records changed all that. Americans might do different things during the workday, but at night and on weekends, we were watching and listening to the same things—things made in America, primarily for Americans, by the first modern celebrities.\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Conclusion: Meeting the AI future\n\nChapter 1\n\nAn innovation as powerful as the steam engine. This is the transformative potential of AI, a technology with a potential impact poised to surpass even the biggest innovations of the past, from the printing press to the automobile. AI does not just automate tasks but goes further by automating cognitive functions. Unlike any invention before, AI-powered software can adapt, plan, guide—and even make—decisions. That’s why AI can be a catalyst for unprecedented economic growth and societal change in virtually every aspect of life. It will reshape our interaction with technology and with one another. [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

AI-driven workforce transformation is further accelerating the need for reskilling, while pathways to skilled global talent are narrowing due to immigration restrictions, H-1B visa policy changes, and expected work authorization delays. Domestic education-to-employment pipelines also remain insufficient, leaving gaps in the talent supply.&quot;,

Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability.

Employment data such as hire date typically lives in systems like:\n\nWorkday\n\nSAP SuccessFactors\n\nOther HRIS platforms\n\nThat data only appears in Entra ID if you explicitly sync or write it there.\n\nSupported and recommended options\n\n1: Use a custom attribute\n\nIf your hire date comes from an HR system or is manually maintained:\n\nStore it in a custom Entra ID attribute, for example:\n\nextension\\_&lt;appId&gt;\\_hireDate\n\nor extensionAttribute1–15 (if synced from on-premises AD)\n\nMap that custom attribute directly to Okta using Okta’s attribute mapping or expressions\n\nThis is the most common and supported approach.\n\n2: Use employeeHireDate\n\nYou can map employeeHireDate only if: [...] employeeHireDate exists but must be explicitly written to\n\nThere is no default expression to derive hire date in Entra ID\n\nBest practice is to store hire date in a custom Entra attribute sourced from HR and map that to Okta.\n\nPlease refer this\n\nI Hope this helps.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The surge in AI investment was not confined to the U.S. and Europe. In Canada, Cohere raised $600 million, while in China, MiniMax AI closed a $300 million round. Beyond these headline transactions, numerous AI-focused startups across regions secured meaningful growth capital. Highlights included U.S.-based Sierra ($350 million), a developer of AI-powered customer service agents; China-based GLP ($348 million) and Runhui Technology Development ($256 million), both focused on AI-driven data center development; Sweden-based Lovable ($200 million), which enables AI-enhanced web and app development; and Canada-based Blue J ($122 million), a legal research platform leveraging AI. [...] ## AI remains the top priority for VC investors\n\nVC investors globally continued to double down on AI in Q3’25, with companies developing AI models and platforms attracting many of the largest funding rounds of the quarter. In addition to the blockbuster $1 billion-plus raises by Anthropic, xAI, and Mistral, New York–based Reflection AI secured $1 billion, reinforcing the sustained appetite for transformative AI bets. [...] Together, these transactions illustrate that AI remains the defining theme in global VC, attracting capital at scale across geographies and use cases — from foundational models and infrastructure to applied vertical solutions. The intense interest in AI solutions has created a highly competitive environment for AI talent across regions; this has led a number of corporates looking to modernize their activities to consider acquiring AI-focused startups in order to gain access to their highly skilled talent.\n\n## Defensetech continues to attract attention globally&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Asia: Q4&#x27;25 Venture Pulse Report&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI remained a central focus for VC investment in Asia during Q3’25, with China attracting the largest share of capital. The quarter’s biggest raises included GLP ($348 million), a data center infrastructure developer, and MiniMax AI ($300 million), which specializes in text-to-video AI. In addition, smartphone-focused AI agent developer Z.ai secured $139 million, underscoring the diversity of AI applications gaining traction in China. [...] ## Deal volume remains subdued — except for D+ rounds\n\nDeal volume in Asia has been quite subdued this year, with numbers well off pace of 2024’s totals across most deal stages at the end of Q3’25. D+ deals were the exception, with deal volume well-positioned to see a modest increase year-over-year should trends continue through Q4’25, although average deal value was substantially lower. The increase in deal volume likely reflects the rapid maturation of startups in Asia — particularly in areas like AI and deeptech, and in jurisdictions like Japan, India, and Indonesia — and the growing number of companies raising later funding rounds. [...] Standout raises this quarter included Newmo (¥17.9B), and Terra Charge (¥10.4B). Hot sectors continue to be AI, healthcare, energy, space, and mobility, though polarization is clear: proven companies and large VC funds are thriving, while smaller funds and weaker startups face bigger hurdles.\n\n## Trends to watch for in Q4’25\n\nHeading into Q4’25, VC investment in Asia will likely remain subdued, particularly in China where economic recovery is expected to take some time. AI and deeptech will likely remain a top priority for investors across the region, in addition to areas like health and biotech.&quot;,

They will need a clear, actionable risk appetite for AI, setting boundaries on where it can be used, acceptable levels of autonomy, and how outcomes are monitored and tested. Effective oversight depends on knowing where AI is deployed, the materiality of each use case, and how performance, incidents and limitations are reported. Boards will need reliable management information on AI performance and risks, and the ability to challenge assumptions, test management confidence, and ensure that AI remains within risk tolerances. They must also be confident that executives can act decisively when issues arise, with clear escalation routes, defined responsibilities, robust controls, and credible plans for pausing AI systems if necessary. [...] Responsibility for AI governance across FS remains uneven, with some exceptions.Oversight is often driven by first line functions or led by Chief Data Officers or Chief Information Officers, whose focus naturally leans towards technical performance. This can mean regulatory and risk considerations receive less attention than they should. More effective models distribute governance across technology, risk and compliance, ensuring a balanced view of performance, safety and regulatory obligations. While accountability may sit in different parts of the organisation depending on each firm’s structure, those accountable should ensure that AI risks are managed in line with regulatory expectations and agreed risk tolerances.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is redefining how organizations create, coordinate, and capture value. As enterprises become AI-native, traditional organizational models are being dismantled and the boundaries of what a ‘job’ is are being reshaped entirely.\n\nCollaboration between humans and AI agents is transforming organizations from rigid structures into dynamic systems of intelligence. Acting as co-workers and autonomous economic actors, they reshape work, markets, and accountability. Business models shift toward Intelligence-as-a-Service, capability marketplaces, and algorithmic organizations. While AI boosts agility and scalability, it raises governance, transparency, and ethical challenges.

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below. [...] Despite regional differences, regulators globally share a common goal: to foster innovation without diluting risk-based oversight. The core principle is that new capabilities, including Generative or agentic AI, must not override sound risk management. Firms can adopt AI quickly, provided they invest in essential capabilities and safeguards: a clear risk appetite, strong internal controls, robust risk management, and, crucially, accountability for outcomes.\n\n#### Operational resilience – efficiency meets reality&quot;,

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk. Healthcare and financial services, two of the most regulated industries in APAC, continue to highlight gaps in AI guardrails, auditability, and real-time oversight.9 When AI is embedded deeply and silently, trust cannot be an afterthought.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] In the Philippines, AI-enabled back-office augmentation is accelerating across the IT-BPM sector. In Australia, higher education institutions and utilities are integrating autonomous assistants into scheduling, student engagement and load management. Malaysia’s airlines and hospitality providers are piloting conversational and operational agents to improve service responsiveness.\n\nBut autonomy brings risk.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

AI-driven workforce transformation is further accelerating the need for reskilling, while pathways to skilled global talent are narrowing due to immigration restrictions, H-1B visa policy changes, and expected work authorization delays. Domestic education-to-employment pipelines also remain insufficient, leaving gaps in the talent supply.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertrauen durch Design. Wie Workday KI baut, die ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In diesem Kontext entsteht KI bei Workday mit einem klaren Ziel: Menschen zu unterstützen, nicht sie zu ersetzen. Das ist besonders im Recruiting von zentraler Bedeutung. Unsere KI trifft keine Einstellungsentscheidungen. Sie lehnt keine Bewerbungen automatisch ab und entscheidet nicht darüber, wer eine Stelle erhält. Stattdessen hilft sie Recruiterinnen, Recruitern und Hiring-Teams dabei, Prozesse mit hohem Volumen effizienter zu steuern, relevante Informationen sichtbar zu machen und administrative Aufgaben zu reduzieren. So bleibt mehr Zeit für fachliche Expertise und menschliches Urteilsvermögen bei Einstellungsentscheidungen. [...] Diese Überzeugung prägt unseren KI-gestützten, menschenzentrierten Ansatz in der Technologieentwicklung. Die KI-Funktionen von Workday sind darauf ausgelegt, Kunden, ihre Mitarbeitenden und Bewerbende zu unterstützen. Sie eröffnen Chancen, liefern klare und verantwortungsvolle Erkenntnisse und stärken die menschliche Entscheidungsfindung, statt sie zu ersetzen. Von der Konzeption unserer Systeme bis zu ihrer Steuerung und ihrem Einsatz gilt: Vertrauen ist kein nachträglicher Zusatz. Es ist von Anfang an Teil des Designs. [...] ## Governance und Aufsicht\n\nVerantwortungsvolle KI braucht mehr als gute Absichten. Sie braucht klare Governance-Strukturen und verbindliche Verantwortlichkeiten. Bei Workday ist die Aufsicht über KI-Systeme fest in unserer Arbeitsweise verankert. Mit klar definierten Rollen, strukturierten Prüfprozessen und aktiver Einbindung der Führungsebene.\n\nUnser internes Responsible AI Advisory Board tagt regelmäßig, um das Programm für verantwortungsvolle KI zu begleiten. Dazu gehören auch neue Funktionen und Anwendungsfälle. Zusätzlich überwacht der Vorstand von Workday den Einsatz neuer Technologien. Darunter generative und agentische KI. Diese Strukturen sorgen gemeinsam dafür, dass KI bei Workday durchdacht, konsistent und im Einklang mit unseren Werten entwickelt und eingesetzt wird.&quot;,

They will need a clear, actionable risk appetite for AI, setting boundaries on where it can be used, acceptable levels of autonomy, and how outcomes are monitored and tested. Effective oversight depends on knowing where AI is deployed, the materiality of each use case, and how performance, incidents and limitations are reported. Boards will need reliable management information on AI performance and risks, and the ability to challenge assumptions, test management confidence, and ensure that AI remains within risk tolerances. They must also be confident that executives can act decisively when issues arise, with clear escalation routes, defined responsibilities, robust controls, and credible plans for pausing AI systems if necessary. [...] Responsibility for AI governance across FS remains uneven, with some exceptions.Oversight is often driven by first line functions or led by Chief Data Officers or Chief Information Officers, whose focus naturally leans towards technical performance. This can mean regulatory and risk considerations receive less attention than they should. More effective models distribute governance across technology, risk and compliance, ensuring a balanced view of performance, safety and regulatory obligations. While accountability may sit in different parts of the organisation depending on each firm’s structure, those accountable should ensure that AI risks are managed in line with regulatory expectations and agreed risk tolerances.&quot;,

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below. [...] it will likely be slow and selective. Overall, areas such as digital assets, operational resilience, and AI will likely attract more, not less, oversight.&quot;,

[...] “The Deloitte study shows that business leaders worldwide continue to place climate change and sustainability among their strategic priorities. With the recent regulatory easing across Europe, including in Romania, executives now have more room to channel resources and vision into turning sustainability from a compliance exercise into a true transformation tool for medium and long-term value creation. Companies are prioritizing in-depth analysis of their processes and operations, supply-chain reviews, and risk mapping as critical steps for unlocking financial efficiencies and enhancing resilience, and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, play a key role in enabling what is an increasingly data-driven corporate sustainability agenda. In fact, most leaders see investing [...] Despite uncertainty and dynamic regulatory changes, sustainability continued to attract investments in 2025, especially technology-related, and remains a priority for 45% of business leaders globally in 2026, next to technology adoption and artificial intelligence (44%), according to Deloitte2025 C-suite Sustainability Global Report. Respondents indicate that they feel less pressure to act on sustainability across nearly every major stakeholder group. That includes regulators, which topped the list in 2022, with 77%, and decreased to 58% in 2025, board members (from 75% in 2022 to 60% in 2025), customers (from 75% to 57%), civil society and NGOs (from 72% to 57%), shareholders (from 71% to 58%), and employees (from 65% to 54%).

They will need a clear, actionable risk appetite for AI, setting boundaries on where it can be used, acceptable levels of autonomy, and how outcomes are monitored and tested. Effective oversight depends on knowing where AI is deployed, the materiality of each use case, and how performance, incidents and limitations are reported. Boards will need reliable management information on AI performance and risks, and the ability to challenge assumptions, test management confidence, and ensure that AI remains within risk tolerances. They must also be confident that executives can act decisively when issues arise, with clear escalation routes, defined responsibilities, robust controls, and credible plans for pausing AI systems if necessary. [...] Responsibility for AI governance across FS remains uneven, with some exceptions.Oversight is often driven by first line functions or led by Chief Data Officers or Chief Information Officers, whose focus naturally leans towards technical performance. This can mean regulatory and risk considerations receive less attention than they should. More effective models distribute governance across technology, risk and compliance, ensuring a balanced view of performance, safety and regulatory obligations. While accountability may sit in different parts of the organisation depending on each firm’s structure, those accountable should ensure that AI risks are managed in line with regulatory expectations and agreed risk tolerances.&quot;,

Policymakers, keen to foster innovation and growth, are expanding sandboxes and industry collaborations to support safe AI use. However, as adoption grows, 2026 will likely bring firmer supervisory scrutiny. As AI becomes more deeply embedded in core business processes and decision-making, supervisors will look for rigorous testing, comprehensive documentation, measurable outcomes, and board-level accountability. The AI agenda connects directly to operational resilience and the growing reliance on third-party providers, themes explored further below. [...] Despite regional differences, regulators globally share a common goal: to foster innovation without diluting risk-based oversight. The core principle is that new capabilities, including Generative or agentic AI, must not override sound risk management. Firms can adopt AI quickly, provided they invest in essential capabilities and safeguards: a clear risk appetite, strong internal controls, robust risk management, and, crucially, accountability for outcomes.\n\n#### Operational resilience – efficiency meets reality&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Types of AI Agents: Definitions, Roles, and Examples&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Information Extraction Agent: This agent transforms unstructured documents (such as PDFs, emails, reports, etc.) into structured data for analysis.\n Knowledge Assistant Agent: This type creates a high-quality, customizable chatbot that can answer questions based on your organization&#x27;s specific data and documents (e.g., HR policies, technical manuals, or product documentation), providing citations for its answers.\n Custom LLM Agent: This agent handles specialized text generation and transformation tasks, such as summarizing customer calls, classifying content by topic, analyzing sentiment, or generating on-brand marketing content. [...] AI agents are moving from novelty to necessity. What began as simple automation and chat-based assistants is evolving into systems that observe their environment, decide what to do next and take action across real workflows. These agents execute jobs, call tools, update systems and influence decisions that once required human judgment.\n\nAs AI systems take action, the stakes increase. Errors can cascade through downstream systems and produce outcomes that are difficult to trace or reverse. This shift turns agentic AI into a system design challenge, requiring teams to think earlier about autonomy, control, reliability and governance. [...] Misunderstandings about intelligence further complicate matters. Agents that appear intelligent often rely more on structure, constraints and careful design than on sophisticated reasoning. Effective agent design is not about maximizing autonomy or intelligence, but about balancing control, flexibility and cost. Teams that make these trade-offs explicit are far more likely to build agents that succeed in production over time.\n\n## Where agentic AI is headed\n\nAgentic AI is evolving quickly, but the direction is becoming clearer. Large language models are changing how agents reason, interact with tools and work with unstructured inputs, making them more flexible and expressive. What they do not change are the fundamental trade-offs that shape agent behavior.&quot;,

Unauthorized or rogue LLM deployments can silently consume cloud resources, leak data, or violate regulatory requirements. A single user error, selecting the wrong model, exposing sensitive data, or triggering runaway costs, can lead to fines or costly remediation in the absence of guardrails. Organizations should therefore maintain a centralized AI asset inventory through AIOps platforms, enforce approval workflows for model deployment, and implement financial controls to prevent uncontrolled spending and risk accumulation.\n\n#### Conclusion&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;MIT’s “State of AI in Business 2025” found that 95% of organisations struggle to generate meaningful ROI from AI, largely due to weak data foundations and integration gaps. The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2 [...] Boomi AI  Lead agentic transformation\n Boomi Agentstudio  Design, govern and orchestrate AI agents\n AI Agents  Deploy AI agents for rapid automation\n Boomi MCP  Deliver agent-ready tools with enterprise governance\n Responsible AI  Enterprise-grade security and governance for agentic transformation\n\nAll Connectors Boomi for SAP    Oracle NetSuite\n\nExplore Boomi Marketplace Connect Any Application Connect with NetSuite Connect with Snowflake Connect with ChatGPT Connect with ServiceNow Connect with Shopify Connect with Google Drive Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Boomi [...] This is why the region is moving rapidly toward data quality, governance and observability being built into the architecture rather than layered on top.\n\n## Modern iPaaS: The Foundation for Responsible Agentic Transformation\n\nModern iPaaS has become the architectural backbone for agentic AI.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One AI technology that has yet to take off in UEM is agentic AI, Cipolla says. This involves the use of AI applications known as agents that execute complex workflows, make decisions, take actions, and interact with other agents — all with limited oversight from humans.\n\n“Agentic AI is a potential transformational force in endpoint management tools, but not currently widely enabled by vendors,” Cipolla says. “We are watching this closely as we expect rapid innovation. Agentic AI not only can generate insights, but can act based on those insights and the risk, business, and operational goals of the organization.” [...] “The endpoint management market is undergoing a rapid transformation fueled by SaaS-powered innovations, deeper integration of threat intelligence, growing reliance on digital [employee] experience tools, and breakthroughs in AI/ML and generative AI [genAI],” says Tom Cipolla, vice president and analyst, Digital Workplace Infrastructure and Operations at research firm Gartner.\n\n“These trends are setting the stage for next-generation solutions that prioritize automation and intelligence,” Cipolla says.\n\nAI, and specifically genAI, are now solidly part of the mobility landscape, as enterprises and vendors continue to look for ways to automate functions and increase efficiency.\n\n## The AI push [...] Enterprises need to understand their genAI use cases well and make a case for return on investment, Roberts says. “AI is not good for its own sake,” he says. “Look for things that AI is good at: anomaly detection, predictive analytics are cool.”\n\nAs with other applications of AI and automation, the technology should not just replace people, but enable them to be more productive. “Keep humans in the loop until you’ve figured out how the system behaves with confidence,” Roberts says. “It’s not a given that AI will make things easier or more efficient, so keeping an eye on the system before you let auto-remediation run rampant is wise.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The next frontier for AI innovation is cross-platform and cross-cloud agentic interoperability, enabling products to operate seamlessly across ecosystems while unlocking new automation and orchestration opportunities. Interoperability will become a core design principle as enterprises demand flexibility across multi-cloud environments and heterogeneous IT stacks.\n\nRobotics and other physical AI devices and systems are emerging as key areas for innovation, creating opportunities for differentiated offerings. Autonomous systems and industrial automation when combined with interoperable agent frameworks will be able to span multiple clouds and commercial platforms. [...] In brief\n\n Technology companies can accelerate growth in 2026 through M&amp;A, partnerships and designing for agentic interoperability across clouds and platforms.\n The adoption of distributed accountability models can play a key role in enabling enterprise-wide AI adoption.\n Linking pricing to outcomes while embracing a flexible approach to model adoption can address customer expectations and accelerate global growth. [...] As AI adoption accelerates and pressure to deliver measurable outcomes grows, technology companies are focusing on getting real returns from their AI investments by rethinking business models and scaling execution. Technology leaders are no longer asking if AI will transform their business, they are focusing on how to operationalise AI strategies safely and reliably and on capturing value with agentic AI solutions.\n\nIn an operating environment that is increasingly nonlinear, accelerated, volatile and interconnected (NAVI), competitive advantage will hinge on organisations embracing maximum flexibility, where autonomous systems handle routine execution while human leaders focus on strategic direction.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Yet as vertical ecosystems multiply, integration complexity increases. The Straits Times reports that M&amp;A activity across APAC shows consolidation rising in fintech, healthcare, logistics, and digital infrastructure,8 each adding new systems and governance requirements.\n\nThis sets the stage for the second shift.\n\n## Prediction 2: Invisible, Embedded Intelligence — The Rise of Agentic Automation\n\nAgentic automation will embed itself directly into finance, HR, supply chain, healthcare, and other workflows. These agents won’t feel like standalone AI systems but like operational infrastructure that continuously orchestrates decisions behind the scenes.

The same study revealed a significant governance gap: 90% of employees use AI tools informally, while only 40% of organisations officially support them, creating unmanaged operational risk.1\n\nBoomi and FT Longitude’s “Navigating the AI Agent Governance Gap” report reinforces this urgency: just 2% of organisations have fully accountable AI agents, and nearly 80% lack visibility or control over agent behaviour.2&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Docebo Acquires 365Talents – Company Announcement&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;365Talents brings deep expertise in AI-driven skills intelligence, applying autonomous agents and machine learning to continuously map, infer, and manage skills across the workforce. Its platform helps enterprises understand gaps and guide employees toward roles, projects, and development opportunities in a more dynamic way.\n\nIndividually, skills intelligence and learning platforms deliver value. Together, they create a multiplier effect. By combining Docebo’s AI-powered learning platform with 365Talents’ agent-based skills intelligence, the combined company is creating a new, AI-native way to manage skills, from detection to development to deployment. [...] “In today’s economy, skills only matter if they can be used,” said Alessio Artuffo, President and CEO of Docebo. “When skills sit on a shelf or live in static models, they quickly lose value. Most vendors help organizations collect and analyze skills, but very few help them act on them.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why AI Without Humanity Is Incomplete&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A skills-led organization takes a holistic view of employees’ skills across the entire employee life cycle—from recruiting and learning to talent development and succession management. Its defining capability is the ability to adapt with speed to external changes and disruptions. A company can adjust required skills almost in real time. This is a prerequisite to staying competitive and responding quickly to customer and market needs.\n\nAI is the catalyst for this adaptability: it identifies skill gaps in real time, personalizes learning journeys, and enables talent to move fluidly to where it is most needed. This turns skills management from a static process into a dynamic system, preparing a workforce that evolves alongside technology rather than being overtaken by it. [...] Consequently, this shift also places new expectations on leaders. As AI progresses, human leadership becomes increasingly important, not less. Leaders must design environments where human and artificial intelligence reinforce each other, and they must actively drive the effective use of AI to deliver business outcomes. This requires adopting a new model, in which leaders fluently manage integrated systems of people and AI agents. They are accountable not only for their human teams’ performance, but also for the limitations of the AI models they deploy. This means creating a working environment where experimentation is encouraged and where people feel supported as their roles evolve. [...] Yet this potential only materializes when people trust the AI tools they use: trust built not just on transparency, but on daily experience of systems that help them succeed.\n\n## Designing the new architecture of work\n\nTo set these human-AI power couples up for success, organizations must rethink the very architecture of work. Trust and collaboration are not enough if the underlying structures remain rigid. Traditional roles and hierarchies cannot keep pace with continuous technological change. Work will become increasingly fluid, shaped by skills, collaboration, and shared intelligence. Our time demands adaptive organizations that continuously learn and enable their teams to take on new challenges as they arise.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Mitsubishi Electric Develops Multi-agent AI for Expert-level ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 19, 2026-- Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO: 6503) announced today that it has developed the manufacturing industry’s first multi-agent AI technology that leverages an argumentation framework to automatically generate adversarial debates among expert AI agents, enabling rapid expert-level decision-making with transparent reasoning. The technology is an outcome of the company’s Maisart® AI program and is designed to improve efficiency in complex expert-level decision-making. [...] To address these challenges, Mitsubishi Electric has developed new technology that applies the concept of “adversarial generation,” as seen in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to multi-agent AI debates, enabling expert AI agents to compete with each other to derive better conclusions. This technology enables deep insights through adversarial debate and evidence-based decision-making, which are difficult with conventional cooperative multi-agent AI systems. Mitsubishi Electric’s solution allows AI to be deployed in highly specialized decision-making involving complex trade-offs, such as security analysis, production planning, and risk assessment, contributing to operational efficiency.\n\nFor the full text, please visit:   www.MitsubishiElectric.com/news/ [...] Businesses are facing increasingly complex decision-making involving trade-offs, such as security risk assessment and production planning. However, these operations require advanced expertise and are prone to dependency on specific individuals, leading to potential difficulties in making decisions when key personnel are absent and time-consuming consensus-building for compromise solutions. Moreover, concerns about the opacity of AI reasoning have led to resistance in applying AI in critical decision-making. AI adoption has been particularly limited in decisions related to security and safety, where transparent reasoning and evidence are essential.&quot;,

And, are you prioritising Responsible AI practices to safeguard stakeholder trust?\n What untapped opportunities exist to drive revenue growth and profitability by adding climate-friendly products and services to your portfolio?\n Do you have a clear view of the potential for your industry’s structure and boundaries to shift—and of how your company’s operations, capabilities and business model need to change—as technology and climate change create new opportunities and constraints?\n Are you investing enough in (and putting enough talent against) your biggest priorities? [...] Looking forward, almost half of CEOs say that their biggest priorities over the next three years are integrating AI (including GenAI) into technology platforms as well as business processes and workflows. Fewer are planning to use AI to develop new products and services or reshape core business strategy. For most companies, this order of priorities makes sense. More surprising is that only a third of CEOs are planning to integrate AI into workforce and skills strategy. This could be a misstep. Realising the potential of GenAI will depend on employees knowing when and how to use AI tools in their work—and understanding the potential pitfalls. [...] and effective programmes to build workforce skills. These foundational moves will also position organisations to seize bigger opportunities ahead, whether this means transforming a specific function or undertaking a more dramatic change of business model. The impact of GenAI will vary among sectors, but its disruptive potential in most is high.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In parallel, novel risks are emerging or intensifying, from Generative and agentic AI and digital assets to operational resilience and geopolitical challenges. While new regulations aim to address some areas, others will likely see increased supervisory focus. This confluence of global regulatory divergence, rapidly evolving risks, and shifting supervisory expectations will make the landscape more complex for firms to navigate. [...] Despite regional differences, regulators globally share a common goal: to foster innovation without diluting risk-based oversight. The core principle is that new capabilities, including Generative or agentic AI, must not override sound risk management. Firms can adopt AI quickly, provided they invest in essential capabilities and safeguards: a clear risk appetite, strong internal controls, robust risk management, and, crucially, accountability for outcomes.\n\n#### Operational resilience – efficiency meets reality [...] Business Process Solutions\n               Services\n               Business Process Solutions\n               Overview\n               Finance Operate (Tax)\n               HR &amp; Payroll Operate\n               Tax &amp; Statutory Compliance\n\n           Customer\n               Services\n               Customer\n               Overview\n               Customer Strategy &amp; Design\n               Customer as a Service/Operate\n               Marketing &amp; Commerce\n               Sales &amp; Services\n\n           Cyber\n               Services\n               Cyber\n               Overview\n               Cyber Defence &amp; Resilience\n                Cyber Operate \n               Cyber Strategy &amp; Transformation\n               Digital Trust &amp; Privacy\n               Enterprise Security&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Recent studies report 41%-56%1 vulnerability rates to injection attacks across state-of-the-art models, underscoring how systemic this issue remains.\n\nThe threat landscape expands further with the rise of Agentic AI. The 2025 OWASP list introduces risks such as excessive agency, where autonomous LLMs are authorized to invoke tools, call APIs, or interact with other systems. Research shows that 82,4%2 of AI agents execute malicious commands when requested by another agent, even when mediated by protocols such as MCP or agent-to-agent (A2A) controls. [...] Authors:\n\n##### To the point\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are transforming enterprise operations, but their adoption introduces new and distinct attack surfaces. From prompt injection to manipulation of autonomous agents, adversaries are exploiting these weaknesses with alarming success, creating a tangible link between vulnerability to trust.\n\nIn this article, we highlight three critical areas for business and security leaders:\n\nDrawing on proven threat modelling methodologies and real-world AI red-teaming, we show why strong security fundamentals remain the bedrock of both enterprise security and AI trust.\n\n#### Introduction [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog&quot;,

With over 300 MGAs now operating in the UK - a remarkable 60% growth since 2019 – these entities are reshaping the market.15 The EU market has also seen significant growth, with most of the MGAs being domiciled in Benelux, Germany and Italy.16,17\n\nUnder the MGA model, traditional insurance carriers provide capital and delegate key functions such as pricing and underwriting to specialised MGAs. This allows the carrier to enter new markets without having to build deep expertise and to take advantage of the more nimble nature of MGAs to operate their business. [...] 15.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot Readiness: Data &amp; Access Security ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In one large services organization, Copilot began returning fragments of budgets and cost analyses to marketing employees — content they were never meant to see.\nThis was not a Copilot malfunction. The root cause was years-old inherited SharePoint permissions that silently granted marketing indirect access to dozens of sensitive locations through outdated folder-level inheritance.\nThis scenario is becoming increasingly common. Microsoft 365 Copilot uses all data a user already has access to — including access that is accidental, inherited or misconfigured. As a result, many organizations unknowingly expose HR files, financial documents, executive materials or legal content. ISCG’s assessment eliminates these risks and prepares the environment for a secure and compliant Copilot rollout. [...] Deep Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Governance Skills\n• Experts in SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Entra ID, Purview and Copilot\n• Strong track record in eliminating oversharing and restoring least privilege\n\nTrusted by Regulated &amp; Large Organizations\n• 20+ years of Microsoft 365 experience\n• Delivery for enterprise, public sector and regulated industries\n• Security clearances: Classified: “NATO Secret”, “EU/ESA Secret”, PKI\n• IT &amp; Security teams prepared for safe AI adoption\n\n### Rychlý přehled\n\n## Další konzultační služby od ISCG so. z o.o.\n\npower-automate product icon\npower-virtual-agents product icon\npowerapps product icon [...] Scope of the Service:\n\nWe analyze real, effective access across SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams and Entra ID, identifying:\n• oversharing and misconfigured permissions\n• broken inheritance and outdated folder structures\n• public Teams and unmanaged private channels\n• excessive Entra ID group access and nested permissions\n• high-risk areas (HR, Finance, Executive, Legal)\n\nWe also validate core security and data protection controls:\n• Microsoft Purview (Sensitivity Labels, DLP, Content/Access Explorer)\n• Entra ID governance (PIM, Access Reviews, role assignments)\n• Conditional Access and MFA resilience\n• overall data visibility from Copilot’s perspective&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Our research finds that the functional areas where AI presents the greatest economic potential are also those where employee outlook is lukewarm. Employees in sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, and R&amp;D contribute roughly three-quarters of AI’s total economic potential, but the self-reported optimism of employees in these functions is middling (Exhibit 14). It may be the case that these functions have piloted AI projects, leading employees to be more realistic about AI’s benefits and limitations. Or perhaps the economic potential has made them worry that AI could replace their jobs. Whatever the reasons, leaders in these functions might consider investing more in employee support and elevating the change champions who can improve that sentiment.\n\nExhibit 14 [...] In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale.\n\nIt’s critical that leaders meet this moment. It’s the only way to accelerate the probability that their companies will reach AI maturity. But they must move with alacrity, or they will fall behind.\n\nChapter 3\n\nDelivering speed and safety.\n\nExhibit 6 [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Vertical Agents, Invisible Intelligence: APAC&#x27;s Next Leap in 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Yet as vertical ecosystems multiply, integration complexity increases. The Straits Times reports that M&amp;A activity across APAC shows consolidation rising in fintech, healthcare, logistics, and digital infrastructure,8 each adding new systems and governance requirements.\n\nThis sets the stage for the second shift.\n\n## Prediction 2: Invisible, Embedded Intelligence — The Rise of Agentic Automation\n\nAgentic automation will embed itself directly into finance, HR, supply chain, healthcare, and other workflows. These agents won’t feel like standalone AI systems but like operational infrastructure that continuously orchestrates decisions behind the scenes. [...] EY’s wider assessments reveal the same bottlenecks across the region: siloed systems, inconsistent data quality, and a shortage of AI-ready skills.3 Boston Consulting Group reports that although APAC is the second-fastest region globally for GenAI adoption, only around 30% of enterprise workflows are mature enough to support AI safely at scale.4\n\n2026 is the year these gaps must close, beginning with the rise of vertical agent ecosystems.\n\n## Prediction 1: The Verticalisation of Agentic AI Ecosystems\n\nAI in APAC is evolving beyond general-purpose models into sovereign and sector-specific ecosystems that reflect the data, regulations, and workflows of each industry.\n\n### Financial Services [...] This is why the region is moving rapidly toward data quality, governance and observability being built into the architecture rather than layered on top.\n\n## Modern iPaaS: The Foundation for Responsible Agentic Transformation\n\nModern iPaaS has become the architectural backbone for agentic AI. It is no longer just middleware or connectivity. It is the enterprise nervous system enabling:\n\n Consistent data quality and lineage\n Secure, governed API pathways\n Real-time event orchestration\n Multicloud interoperability\n Full lifecycle visibility over agent behaviour\n\nIt ensures AI agents operate with the right connections, context, and controls. Without this, autonomy becomes unpredictable, especially in high-stakes environments such as banking, healthcare, transportation, and public services.&quot;,

HR may prioritize people analytics, workforce planning and performance management while IT focuses on building scalable, governed data foundations.\n\nThese outcomes have value, but without clarity on the goals each effort is meant to achieve, specific initiatives may not support business activity, profitable growth, customer and employee satisfaction, competitive positioning, enterprise value or risk reduction. As a result, sound initiatives can stall, not for lack of value, but because teams are not aligned on the meaning of success.\n\nThe solution? Coordinate on business goals before integrating data for AI.\n\n## How to align on business goals before data integration [...] When HR and IT execute on business goals and treat data integration as a shared, strategic capability, they&#x27;re better positioned to support generative and agentic workflows that move the business forward.\n\nGo deeper: Join HR and IT leaders for an engaging discussion on how data integration and AI can enhance collaboration, streamline operations and improve business outcomes.\n\nAccess the webinar\n\nBrett Daniel contributed to this article.\n\n## Recommended for You\n\n### Tools &amp; Resources\n\nTake your organization to the next level with practical tools and resources that can help you work smarter.\n\nVisit Resource Center\n\n### Recommend a Topic\n\nIs there a topic or business challenge you would like to see covered on SPARK?\n\nStay in the know on the latest workforce trends and insights.&quot;,

Customer service and R&amp;D also show about 50 percent of employees with a positive outlook on gen AI, but a much lower potential economic value. Several functions, such as operations, HR, Strategy, and IT, cluster together with low potential economic value and similarly middling employee optimism. Employes in IT, finance, and procurement are the most optimistic about gen AI, with about 70 percent of employees reporting positive sentiment, but these functions represent low economic potential from gen AI. [...] The exhibit further illustrates employees’ comfort levels with using gen AI results, belief in the net benefits of gen AI within the next five years, and plans to utilize gen AI more in their personal lives. In the Doomer archetype, 47 percent say they are comfortable using gen AI results, 54 percent believe in gen AI’s net benefit within the next five years, and 49 percent plan increased personal use of gen AI. The Gloomer archetype shows markedly higher percentages in these three areas: 79 percent, 82 percent, and 77 percent respectively. The Bloomer and Zoomer archetypes present even higher percentages across these three metrics; for instance, 91 percent of Zoomers are comfortable using gen AI results, 87 percent believe in gen AI’s net benefit within five years, and 85 percent plan to [...] The exhibit shows the anticipated timeline for US employees&#x27; and business leaders’ use of gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily work tasks, presented as two stacked bar charts, one for C-suite respondents and one for employees. The segments are broken down into five categories representing different timeframes: Already using, less than a year, 1-5 years, over 5 years, and don&#x27;t anticipate it. A final category, not sure, is also included. A key finding highlighted in the chart is that employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so).

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Fragmented stacks, hand-coded ETL and static dashboards are dead; AI is forcing data management to finally grow up in 2026.\n\n### Why CIOs need a new approach to unstructured data management\n\nUnstructured data isn’t an asset by default — it’s a liability until CIOs govern, lifecycle and curate it for AI-ready value.\n\n### The workforce shift — why CIOs and people leaders must partner harder than ever\n\nAI isn’t just another tech rollout — it changes how work feels and flows, which is why CIOs and people leaders have to redesign jobs together.\n\n### The illusion of control: Why IT leaders cannot rely on clear roles and responsibilities\n\nTrying to lock down roles won’t tame uncertainty — empowering teams to adapt, learn fast and focus on outcomes works far better in today’s IT reality. [...] AI isn’t failing because it’s immature.

Projects fail without good change management and everyone needs to be involved. Your teams must understand that people aren’t resistant to change. They’re resistant to having change done to them. You have to teach them how to bring others through the change process instead of pushing change at them.\n\nTeach your project teams how to engage stakeholders early and often so they feel part of the change journey. When people are included, feel heard, and involved in shaping the solution, resistance starts to fade and you create a united force that supports your accelerated delivery plan.\n\n## Mistake #5: Communicating for compliance instead of engagement&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] Image 7: \&quot; \&quot;\n\n### World Economic Forum: A debrief of Davos 2026\n\n_January 28, 10:30 - 11:00 a.m. ET / 4:30 - 5:00 p.m. CET_\n\nJoin Senior Partners Becca Coggins and Shelley Stewart for a dynamic debrief on the conversations that stood out at Davos. They&#x27;ll explore the themes rising to the top of the 2026 agenda—from agentic AI and the future of 21st-century leadership to geopolitics and new pathways to growth—and share practical takeaways every leader can put into action now.\n\nRegister here\n\n### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] Image 7: \&quot; \&quot;\n\n### World Economic Forum: A debrief of Davos 2026\n\n_January 28, 10:30 - 11:00 a.m. ET / 4:30 - 5:00 p.m. CET_\n\nJoin Senior Partners Becca Coggins and Shelley Stewart for a dynamic debrief on the conversations that stood out at Davos. They&#x27;ll explore the themes rising to the top of the 2026 agenda—from agentic AI and the future of 21st-century leadership to geopolitics and new pathways to growth—and share practical takeaways every leader can put into action now.\n\nRegister here\n\n### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024.&quot;,

Control maintains compliance\n\nThere are lot of governance challenges related to instantiating a single bot, let alone thousands. One Deloitte client spent several meetings trying to determine whether its bot was male or female, a valid gender question, but one that must take into account human resources, ethics, and other areas of compliance for the business.\n\n### 8. Build an RPA center of excellence\n\nThe most successful RPA implementations include a center of excellence staffed by people responsible for making efficiency programs a success within the organization. Not every enterprise, however, has the budget for this. The RPA center of excellence develops business cases, calculating potential cost optimization and ROI, and measures progress against those goals.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;1. EY launching EY.ai Agentic Platform, created with NVIDIA AI, to drive multi-sector transformation starting with tax, risk and finance domains | EY - Global\n\n#### Summary\n\nAgainst a backdrop of an extremely volatile operating environment, technology companies must continue to execute AI at pace and scale if they are not to cede ground to competitors. Organisations still face significant challenges, including a shifting regulatory landscape, talent shortages, and persistent concerns about potential AI harms. Yet this is also an opportunity to lead by adopting new governance approaches and commercial strategies tailored for the AI era.\n\nRelated content\n\nHow TMT companies can lead the charge towards a sustainable future [...] A recent EY poll of tech CEOs found that 83% are prioritising joint ventures and alliances in the coming months, up nearly 30% compared to January 2025. Technology companies are forming structured alliances and partnerships to unlock new markets, scale distribution and secure data rights. The EY collaboration with NVIDIA1 to launch risk management solutions on the EY.ai agentic platform illustrates how alliances can combine domain expertise with advanced AI infrastructure to accelerate innovation and deliver value. Such collaborations not only accelerate growth but also enable access to sectors that were previously restricted due to regulatory or financial barriers.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;e&amp; and IBM have introduced an agentic AI solution built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate – a product offering more than 500 tools and customizable, domain-specific agents from IBM and its partners – to help employees and auditors quickly access and interpret legal, regulatory, and compliance information. Integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio, the solution delivers clear, traceable responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.\n\nImage 2: Download e&amp; and IBM unveil enterprise-grade agentic AI at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Ana Paula Assis, SVP and Chair for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific, IBM and Hatem Dowidar, Group CEO, e&amp; [...] IBM watsonx Orchestrate enables agentic AI that goes beyond chat-based interactions, allowing AI agents to reason, orchestrate tasks, and integrate with enterprise systems under governance controls. For e&amp;, it provides a foundation for trusted, explainable AI that can scale across compliance and other enterprise domains. It helps to streamline compliance tasks, reduce response times, and enable 24/7 self-service access across the organization. [...] “As organizations move from experimenting with AI to embedding it into the fabric of how they operate, governance and accountability become just as important as intelligence,” said Ana Paula Assis, SVP and Chair for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific, IBM. “Through our collaboration with e&amp;, this proof of concept intends to demonstrate how agentic AI can be designed and validated for enterprise-scale use, deeply integrated into core systems, governed by design, and trusted to support human-led decisions and outcomes.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What is Cyber Resilience? | IBM&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Future of cyber resilience\n\nCyber resilience strategies continue to evolve as new technologies create both security opportunities and threats. Extended detection and response (XDR) platforms are maturing to deliver integrated threat detection across multiple security layers, while AI-powered threat detection systems advance to identify sophisticated attack patterns that traditional tools miss. Rather than replacing human expertise, AI is amplifying it.\n\nIn the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) study, Cybersecurity 2028, 65% of executives surveyed report that AI and automation are creating more productive environments for their IT and security teams. And 62% said that they are already seeing significant returns from integrated AI capabilities. [...] Flash storage with built‑in, AI‑driven protection and immutable snapshots to defend against cyberattacks and enable fast recovery.\n\nProtect and safeguard your data against failures, cyberattacks, and disasters with AI‑powered threat detection, immutable snapshots, and enterprise‑grade storage resilience.\n\nAI-powered detection, monitoring, and rapid response to protect IT, OT, and hybrid-cloud environments.\n\nIBM FlashSystem Cyber Resilience and Storage for Data Resilience — AI‑powered protection, immutable backups, and fast recovery for secure, reliable data. [...] ## Essential tools for cyber resilience\n\nThe following tools allow organizations to withstand and recover from cyberattacks, minimize disruptions and maintain business operations:\n\n## Cyber resilience in the age of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence and generative AI present both opportunities and risks for cyber resilience. While AI-powered security tools can enhance threat detection and response capabilities, ungoverned AI systems create new vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Generative AI tools also introduce unique challenges around data governance and potential misuse.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI powers true end-to-end automation by replacing rigid workflows with adaptive, goal-driven orchestration. Unlike traditional automation that follows fixed rules, it acts as a proactive collaborator — sensing, deciding and acting across interconnected systems, Kompella pointed out. \n\n“Everybody wants to talk about agentic AI,” she said. “The technology promise means, first of all, end-to-end process automation experience, end-to-end seamless coordination between organizational processes — people, clients and employees. It’s possible because of the ability of memory, perception, reasoning, learning, which gives the ability to act and be decisive, which was not there in traditional automation technologies before.” [...] Agentic AI solutions elevate human potential by serving as collaborative, goal-driven partners. Rather than executing pre-defined tasks, the agents make decisions, adapt to change and proactively drive outcomes across sectors such as supply chain, warehousing and manufacturing, according to Lim. [...] “In the current world, the human resource, the people are the most important parts,” he said. “The robots and agents are actually strategic enablers to help us deliver the outcomes. With the AI agents in some of the places like warehousing, service supply networks, we have actually reduced the number of hours required from days to actually hours. For example, one of our key business experts was working previously in a warehouse environment performing more of the tasks in the warehouse itself. Now he has moved to become an analyst.”&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI Tool: Modernize Legacy - Capgemini Switzerland&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Capgemini, we have developed an innovative approach that takes advantage of agentic AI coding agents to significantly reduce the time needed to modernize legacy applications.\n\nOur AI agent tool – a sophisticated multi-agent system – is purpose-built to make legacy systems future-safe. We have designed it to support software teams in migrating custom-built applications from outdated technology stacks to modern platforms.\n\nAt the heart of the solution is the orchestration of a collaborative team of AI agents. This allows development teams to automate a large portion of the modernization process (see figure 2), resulting in a far more efficient, scalable approach to modernizing and migrating software. [...] The instructions transfer Capgemini’s deep expertise to the agent, both in understanding the legacy system and in designing the target software architecture. They also determine the specific role each AI agent is assigned in the migration.\n\nSo that the transition runs smoothly, the roles of these AI agents mirror those in a human development team migrating a legacy application (see figure 3). A software developer agent analyzes the existing source code and rewrites it using the target technology. A testing or quality assurance (QA) agent then validates the code against predefined test cases. If any tests fail, the QA agent provides detailed error messages and returns the code to the developer for revision. [...] ##### Jun 9, 2025\n\n## Capgemini’s innovative AI agent tool is helping organizations in the public sector and beyond to reduce the cost and time of modernizing their legacy applications\n\nFor years, and across industries, rapid developments in digitalization have been creating challenges for companies around adapting to technological change. Particularly challenging are “legacy issues” such as outdated applications or obsolete software that need transferring to current technologies to stay maintainable.\n\nThis has unfortunately resulted in us talking about legacy modernization for so long that the first modernizations are already due to be modernized again.&quot;,

Transforming Financial Services with Agentic AI | Capgemini. * Reimagining financial services with agentic AI. Reimagining financial services with agentic AI. * **Agentic AI goes beyond generative chat:** It employs agents that plan, act, and adapt across banking and insurance throughout the cloud modernization lifecycle. Agentic AI in financial services reimagines business flows by enabling systems to make autonomous decisions, adapt in real time, and optimize outcomes across complex processes. Agentic AI solutions can think, take decisions, and pick the right path to execute, which brings sophisticated automation to human intensive legacy processes – supporting many agentic AI use cases across the industry. While generative AI enhances individual tasks, agentic AI drives end-to-end value by integrating reasoning, memory, and control into enterprise-scale processes. * Agentic AI is a complex, multi-dependency program: governance, data, models, controls, and organizational change all at once. Agentic AI is rapidly transforming the insurance value chain – bringing speed, intelligence, and efficiency to every touchpoint. Banks are moving towards agentic AI platforms to drive intelligent automation, personalization, and operational agility. In investment management, agentic systems accelerate research, optimize risk models, and streamline compliance, allowing firms to respond faster to market shifts. Meanwhile, in cards and payments, agentic AI enhances fraud detection, automates dispute resolution, and enables dynamic credit decisioning – delivering safer, faster, and more adaptive services – strengthening the**benefits of artificial intelligence in banking**. ### Agentic AI: driving acceleration and efficiency in the cloud modernization lifecycle. One Capgemini customer, a US bank, reported a 20–30% increase in developer throughput with an agentic approach, as developers spent less time on code comprehension, validation, and documentation, and more time on value-added tasks – enabling more features to be delivered per sprint. This not only streamline modernization efforts, but also empowers firms to build adaptive, resilient applications more quickly – unlocking differentiated value and reducing time to market – a strong illustration of**agentic AI in finance**. ****Agentic AI Redefining Cloud Management**:**. With agentic AI, cloud management becomes not just smarter – but radically more agile, resilient, and future-ready. She plays a key role in leading Capgemini’s agentic AI platform capabilities and go-to-market, to drive enterprise transformation in financial services.&quot;,

And the findings confirm what many CIOs and CTOs feel every day: organizations are excited about agentic AI, but few believe their foundations are mature enough to let AI agents operate at the core of their business. [...] A recent Fortune analysisof the study underscores the urgency: only 6% of companies fully trust AI agents to autonomously run core business processes, yet 86% plan to increase their investment in agentic AI over the next two years\n\nThis widening gap between ambition and readiness is the defining challenge of enterprise AI adoption.  \nAnd it’s exactly where enterprise orchestration and the Enterprise MCP come in.\n\nBulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.Bulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.\nBulding turst in agentic AI, a study by Harvard Business Review and Workato.\n\n## AI Agents Are Coming Fast—But Core Systems Aren’t Ready [...] More than 74% of organizations are working on or planning to implement enterprise orchestration to prepare for agentic AI—because orchestration provides the connective tissue agents need to safely operate across systems, data, and workflows.\n\nThis is why the foundation of Enterprise MCP is so important.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Click to increase view\n\n Activate to open full-size image in lightbox overlay\n\nThe focus on automation, AI and digital spend shows that the pivot to AI is already underway, with the center of gravity shifting from on-demand content generation to autonomy and orchestration directly serving business goals, or as we call it: agentification of processes.\n\n## What is agentic AI, and why the hype?\n\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent software that autonomously makes decisions and acts upon it to achieve defined goals without continuous human input. It operates around the clock, learns from its environment, and adapts as conditions change. In HR, its power lies in how it combines three complementary capability levers:\n\n 1 [...] In recruiting, for instance, AI agents can plan searches, screen CVs, score candidates, schedule interviews, validate skills and draft recommendations for candidate selections, adapting shortlists based on recruiter feedback and continuously optimizing alignment with company goals and recruiter feedback. The shift is less about a setting up a single “super agent”, and more about carefully scaled individual agents for HR key areas that keep humans in the loop where judgment and context matters (e.g., talent sourcing, L&amp;D, HR ticket resolution).\n\nBecause it unites autonomy, learning, and orchestration, agentic AI can already support more than 70% of HR processes. The gains vary by process: some primarily deliver FTE reduction, others improve service quality, and some unlock both. [...] 1\n\n  Transactional automation accelerates repetitive, rule-based tasks to reduce errors and cost\n 2\n\n  Strategic augmentation supports human decisions with real-time insights for better strategy and planning\n 3\n\n  Central orchestration coordinates complex workflows across systems for real-time, end-to-end execution\n\nTraditional generative tools excel at creating content from prompts but remain reactive. Agentic AI builds on these capabilities by adding goal-directed reasoning, persistent memory, and the ability to plan and execute actions within defined guardrails. In practice, this transforms static outputs into dynamic workflows that continuously learn from human feedback.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How do you tell your 20-year-tenured employee in the call center, “Now there is this agent that is going to do the job much better than you”? This person would probably say, “How can this AI thingy that got trained yesterday replace my 20 years of experience?” And there is a big step toward driving the incentives for usage, role modeling communication, and creating the right change story for these employees to understand, “Look at all the great possibilities this unlocks for you.”\n\nThis tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\n### McKinsey Talks Talent Podcast [...] Jorge Amar: First, HR will need to be at least business proficient in what an agentic workforce can do. How can you drive a change management program if you don’t know what your agentic workforce can and cannot do, or what will be possible in three years?\n\nSecond, I think HR will play an important role in reskilling human employees. Today, you can probably fully agentize the workload of a level-one support engineer. But you might want to repurpose that person to become a prompt engineer or to do content generation for AI training. An HR function that can do that at scale is another critical component and skill set that HR will need to develop if you think about the next three, five years: “What is the evolution of that role?” [...] Apple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights&quot;,

[...] By effectively acting as coworkers, today’s multiagentic systems can boost the productivity and efficiency of operational teams and make possible previously unimaginable business process transformations. They also represent a step-up from both predictive AI models and single large language models (LLMs) in their ability to automate complex, multistep workflows, get better over time, and perform tasks within clear guardrails (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2\n\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;An enterprise-wide AI/agentic strategy. Senior leaders are aligned with the strategy, and enterprise-level programs tie directly to the company’s biggest priorities. Agents are used to reimagine business models and create new sources of value as well as propel efficiency.\n These critical capabilities:\n  + People. Employees are equipped for a world of human–agent collaboration. Some companies have introduced new roles such as agent orchestrator and human-in-the-loop designer.\n  + Governance. A strong governance framework defines agents’ autonomy levels, decision boundaries, and overnight mechanisms.\n  + Tech architecture. Over time, enterprise architecture will be reshaped by agents as they become the connective tissue of day-to-day operations. [...] Capturing the value of agentic AI requires wielding the power of an agentic AI mesh—a composable, distributed, and governed architecture that enables multiple agents to reason, collaborate, and act autonomously across systems in a secure and scalable way. The agentic AI mesh becomes the connective tissue of the enterprise; it coordinates the work of multiple agents, integrates with core systems, and evolves along with the technology itself.\n\nResetting a company’s approach to AI transformation is no simple task.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI explained: Video series | McKinsey\n\nSkip to main content\n\nAgentic AI explained: When machines don’t just chat, but act\n\nPrint\n\nSave\n\n# Agentic AI explained: When machines don’t just chat, but act\n\n| Article\n\nPrint\n\nSave\n\nThree McKinsey experts explain how agentic AI could reshape workflows, decision-making, and how humans and machines collaborate.\n\nAgentic AI—the latest wave of artificial intelligence—doesn’t just generate text or code. It takes action. Whereas early large language models (LLMs) could answer questions or summarize information, agentic systems can now perform complex tasks independently, autonomously trigger workflows, and collaborate with other agents.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights [...] Michael Chui: In any organization, you have different people specializing in different things. When we look toward the agentic enterprise of the future, we can imagine AI agents that specialize in doing different things, too. You might have an agent that’s planning, for example, and you might have an agent that’s interacting with customers. You might have an agent that specializes in logistics and supply chain. The idea of an agentic mesh is that you’ll need some sort of technological substrate so that all of these agents can coordinate and talk to each other.\n\n## How agentic AI could change day-to-day work [...] ## Balancing risk with opportunity\n\nMichael Chui: There are a lot of risks that come with AI agents, which echo the risks of AI itself. LLMs are nondeterministic; they can have a variety of outputs, and sometimes those include what we call a hallucination, or a confidently stated opinion that just isn’t true. There are also risks involved with agents interacting with customers; they may be perceived as being rude or insufficiently empathetic. And when you have different agents interacting in an agentic mesh, you can get what computer scientists call race conditions: where agents end up in a cycle that doesn’t technically work.&quot;,

Accelerating agentic AI deployment at a top pharmaceutical company. # Accelerating agentic AI deployment at a top pharmaceutical company. How we accelerated agentic AI POCs for specific domains to prepare for enterprise-wide transformation. McKinsey leveraged agentic AI to enhance productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction across sales and service divisions to scale for organizational transformation. ### The challenge. The client faced inefficiencies in market access operations due to manual processes, siloed data, and decentralized insight. The market access operations team had deployed limited AI use cases compared to other commercial sub-domains. The client identified AI agents as enablers to empower teams to focus on higher-value work and handle increased workloads. ### The Solution. Collaborating with Microsoft, McKinsey helped the client quickly develop agentic AI POCs to streamline market access operations. McKinsey also conducted an art of the possible gen AI/agentic AI workshop with clients to identify 14 core use cases to address. Based on this, the team developed a 12- to 18-month phased deployment approach based on priority use cases, starting with building and testing POCs to accelerate output. The effort then progressed to a 6-month MVP build of targeted areas to expand knowledge and conduct a “big bang” style launch. ### The Result. McKinsey and Microsoft successfully deployed a Microsoft Copilot solution to deliver insights and support Commercial Sales in pre-call planning, which resulted in a 1–2 percent revenue increase. McKinsey also developed an integrated AI-enabled platform to review and correct Commercial Marketing content that led to a 5–20 percent reduction in content costs and streamline time to launch to 1–2 weeks.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The future of agentic AI in travel and hospitality | McKinsey. # Remapping travel with agentic AI. Agentic AI could upend the travel industry. Travel and hospitality organizations should explore how agentic can help catalyze AI’s transformative potential. ##### Remapping travel with agentic AI. Given the tremendous potential of agentic AI, travel and hospitality companies are beginning to experiment with it. What does the travel industry need to know as it ponders going all in on agentic AI? A new report, *Remapping travel with agentic AI*—a collaboration between McKinsey and Skift—examines the potential for agentic AI to unleash the full value of AI in travel. Based on analysis incorporating surveys of 1,002 travelers and 86 travel executives, the report traces the digital prologue that brought the industry to this moment, details agentic AI’s transformative capabilities for both travelers and travel companies, and provides a blueprint for travel and hospitality leaders who are eager to accelerate their organizations’ agentic AI initiatives. In a survey of 86 mostly US-based travel executives conducted for this report, 26 percent of respondents say that introducing AI to their organizations has led to cost reductions in operations, 30 percent say that it’s aiding faster decision-making, 33 percent say that it’s improving customer personalization, 36 percent say that it’s enabling higher-quality outputs, and 59 percent say that it’s increasing employee productivity. Perhaps chief among these is the advent of agentic AI, a cutting-edge technology poised to revolutionize the travel industry. ## The agentic-AI-powered future of customer experience in travel. ## How agentic AI can improve travel’s internal workflows. ### Agentic AI’s value for frontline travel workers. Of the travel executives we surveyed, 90 percent say that their organizations currently use gen AI in some capacity, but 38 percent say that they’re not using agentic AI at all. Insights and lessons learned from tech adoption efforts across various industries can provide a valuable road map for travel companies that hope to initiate or accelerate their own adoption of agentic AI. Technologies such as agentic AI don’t reimagine the *why* of travel. It will be the companies that can deploy agentic AI in ways that feel authentic to both the organization and the customers it serves.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;29th Global CEO Survey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Looking forward, almost half of CEOs say that their biggest priorities over the next three years are integrating AI (including GenAI) into technology platforms as well as business processes and workflows. Fewer are planning to use AI to develop new products and services or reshape core business strategy. For most companies, this order of priorities makes sense. More surprising is that only a third of CEOs are planning to integrate AI into workforce and skills strategy. This could be a misstep. Realising the potential of GenAI will depend on employees knowing when and how to use AI tools in their work—and understanding the potential pitfalls. [...] and effective programmes to build workforce skills. These foundational moves will also position organisations to seize bigger opportunities ahead, whether this means transforming a specific function or undertaking a more dramatic change of business model. The impact of GenAI will vary among sectors, but its disruptive potential in most is high.
