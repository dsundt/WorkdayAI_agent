<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset='utf-8'><meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width,initial-scale=1'><title>No Significant Daily Updates in Workday Ecosystem (Dec 21–22, 2025)</title><style>body{font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;max-width:760px;margin:32px auto;padding:0 16px;line-height:1.5}</style></head><body><h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No major AI, agentic, or ecosystem developments were published in the Workday ecosystem in the last 24 hours.</strong><br/>
    <p>During the reporting window (2025-12-21T06:38 to 2025-12-22T06:38 ET), there were no new press releases, executive statements, analyst reports, or ecosystem partner activities linked to Workday’s HCM/Finance capabilities, AI agent strategies, or adjacent competitive moves. This lack of news provides stability but also reaffirms the ongoing importance of proactive surveillance, as past weeks have seen rapid change in AI enablement, competitive posturing, and risk awareness. Clients and practitioners should use the lull for knowledge enablement, preparation for new solution rollouts, and engagement on governance topics. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, maintaining readiness and upskilling on AI agent concepts remains prudent despite the absence of breaking news from this window.</p>
    <p>If this lack of activity persists for several days, it may indicate industry pause ahead of year-end or a tactical regroup among major vendors. However, given the highly dynamic nature of this space, more substantial updates or risks may emerge with little notice. For now, organizations are afforded a brief window to consolidate recent learnings, reinforce safe adoption practices, and revisit their agentic AI roadmaps.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Global HCM SaaS Vendors (SAP, Oracle, UKG, Dayforce, ServiceNow, ADP, etc.)</strong><br/>
    <p>No significant competitive launches or AI/agentic announcements identified in the last 24 hours.</p>
    <p>While the equilibrium holds, Deloitte practitioners and Workday clients should remain alert for year-end announcements or strategic pivots, which are common in this season. Competitive dynamics could shift swiftly given recent moves earlier in December from several vendors regarding AI agent integration, AI-enabled admin tools, and expanded partnerships. Deloitte must ensure knowledge hygiene and readiness to compare, contrast, and articulate Workday advantages if competitors announce new features or partnerships later this week.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Continuous monitoring of Workday AI, agentic, and governance developments</strong><br/>
    <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource: Workday Newsroom</a>
    <p>By re-dedicating team resources to monitoring and synthesizing ecosystem shifts, Deloitte’s Workday teams remain on the front foot, prepared to translate rapid change into actionable insight for prospects and clients.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Review and consolidate learnings from recent Workday AI agent/model releases in November and early December, focusing on implications for client roadmaps and Deloitte accelerators.</li>
  <li>Develop talking points and enablement collateral on Workday’s AI and agentic features compared to competitive SaaS vendors, in anticipation of potential late December/January updates.</li>
  <li>Continue risk monitoring for responsible AI, data governance, compliance, and competitive responses, with a readiness to escalate material changes or emerging threats.</li>
  <li>Encourage Deloitte Workday practitioners to attend internal enablement sessions on AI-driven workflow automation and governance best practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potential for sudden, impactful competitor announcements outside normal cycles creating pressure on Workday and Deloitte’s value proposition.</strong><br/>
    Mitigation: Maintain daily horizon scanning using pre-vetted, authoritative sources, and coordinate with alliance, sales, and solution architecture leads for immediate synthesis and client communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk of complacency or knowledge stasis among Deloitte’s Workday practitioners during periods of low news volume.</strong><br/>
    Mitigation: Use quieter periods for concentrated enablement on technical, regulatory, and risk-averse AI adoption practices, updating knowledge repositories in anticipation of new industry moves.</li>
</ul>

This lack of news provides stability but also reaffirms the ongoing importance of proactive surveillance, as past weeks have seen rapid change in AI enablement, competitive posturing, and risk awareness. Clients and practitioners should use the lull for knowledge enablement, preparation for new solution rollouts, and engagement on governance topics. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, maintaining readiness and upskilling on AI agent concepts remains prudent despite the absence of breaking news from this window.\\n\\n  If this lack of activity persists for several days, it may indicate industry pause ahead of year-end or a tactical regroup among major vendors. However, given the highly dynamic nature of this space, more substantial updates or risks may emerge with little notice. For now, organizations are afforded a brief window to consolidate recent learnings, reinforce safe adoption practices, and revisit their agentic AI roadmaps.\\n  Source: Workday Newsroom https://newsroom.workday.com/press-releases\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- Global HCM SaaS Vendors (SAP, Oracle, UKG, Dayforce, ServiceNow, ADP, etc.): No significant competitive launches or AI/agentic announcements identified in the last 24 hours.\\n  While the equilibrium holds, Deloitte practitioners and Workday clients should remain alert for year-end announcements or strategic pivots, which are common in this season.

[...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agent autonomy without guardrails is an SRE nightmare&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As AI use continues to evolve in large organizations, leaders are increasingly seeking the next development that will yield major ROI. The latest wave of this ongoing trend is the adoption of AI agents. However, as with any new technology, organizations must ensure they adopt AI agents in a responsible way that allows them to facilitate both speed and security. [...] The first is shadow AI, when employees use unauthorized AI tools without express permission, bypassing approved tools and processes. IT should create necessary processes for experimentation and innovation to introduce more efficient ways of working with AI. While shadow AI has existed as long as AI tools themselves, AI agent autonomy makes it easier for unsanctioned tools to operate outside the purview of IT, which can introduce fresh security risks. [...] Secondly, organizations must close gaps in AI ownership and accountability to prepare for incidents or processes gone wrong. The strength of AI agents lies in their autonomy. However, if agents act in unexpected ways, teams must be able to determine who is responsible for addressing any issues.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Rather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work. [...] The role of agentic AI is expanding—and so is the scope of decisions that must be made around it. Leaders must be intentional when shaping that transformation to unlock long-term advantage.\n\nWant to go deeper on how agentic AI is transforming work at scale? Discover how Workday is building enterprise-grade AI agents designed for trust, impact, and action.\n\nElevating Human Potential: The AI Skills Revolution [...] Choosing the right use cases also means aligning stakeholders around success metrics. That might mean reduced cycle time in finance, faster resolution in HR, or improved compliance in healthcare. With these metrics in place, organizations can scale with purpose—and make agentic AI a sustained part of how business gets done.\n\n&gt; Eighty-three percent of workers believe AI can boost their careers, help them develop skills, and allow them to focus on more meaningful work.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Grippo said using Extend has been a powerful tool for nontechnical workers to bring ideas to life that otherwise they would not be able to create. By combining it with Copilot, it will combine the best of both worlds, helping bridge the gap between the highly technical and those with less coding experience who are just throwing together more simple applications. [...] The company said it’s also expanding the Developer Copilot, its conversational AI codeveloper that allows developers to work faster, with Workday Extend, a low-code no-code tool that allows users to quickly take ideas from alpha mode to deployment. [...] With the new AI Agent Gateway developers will be able to connect third-party agents to the Workday Agent System of Record, a platform the company launched in February aimed at helping businesses onboard agents and treat them like any new piece of software. At the time the company said businesses were facing an unprecedented influx of AI agents from all corners that were serving to solve numerous use cases, but didn’t have a good way to manage them.&quot;,

Policy rules execute the moment data lands, while learning algorithms observe usage patterns and fine-tune safeguards in the background.

[...] By integrating AI-driven insights into your governance engine, you create a system that not only enforces rules but anticipates issues, continuously refines controls, and empowers your team to focus on strategy rather than data maintenance.\n\n&gt; Gartner predicts that without a catalyst for modernization, 80% of data governance strategies will fail by 2027.\n\n## Solutions for a Strong Governance Foundation [...] While automation rapidly executes across governance pillars, it still runs on fixed rules.

[...] To me (BE) there are 3 words:  \n   \n \&quot;Workaday\&quot; (adjective) = mundane; common; usual; standard (of quality); \&quot;The new cell phone is not remarkable at all, it has a workaday processor and last year&#x27;s screen.\&quot; (Often used in the phrase \&quot;[in the] workaday world of high finance/professional football/aviation/teaching, etc, etc.\&quot; meaning &#x27;normal and not exciting area of activity&#x27;) [...] In general, if it&#x27;s an adjective, it will be written as one word but if it is being used with \&quot;day\&quot; as a noun, it will be written as two words. The same is true for \&quot;every day\&quot; and \&quot;everyday\&quot;  \n   \n The workday world can be difficult.  \n I missed three work days due to illness.  \n   \n The everyday habits of my friend are just like mine.  \n I have classes every day, Monday through Friday.  \n   \n That&#x27;s just a general pattern, and I can&#x27;t guarantee that it will always be followed.\n\n#### PaulQ&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A workday or work day is a day on which you work: Monday to Friday, normally. A working day could be the same as that, but is perhaps more often used for the hours of the day you&#x27;re at work. If something happens during the working day, it happens between 9 and 5.30 or whenever. My working day was busy yesterday.\n\nS\n\n#### sasmith\n\n##### Member\n\nBritish English\n\n #5 [...] You are using an out of date browser.

This is the usual expression if you mean those five days. We&#x27;d talk about working days only if there was a possibility of them being different - so &#x27;working days&#x27; excludes public holidays. A bank might guarantee to clear a cheque (put the money in your account) within three working days.

But jour ouvrable suivant = next business day. I thik business day is mostly used for commerce and finance.   \n   \n Now - as already suggested - there is a difference to be made between jour ouvré and jour ouvrable.   \n   \n As found in the GDT, under jour ouvrable  \n&gt; Définition :  \n&gt;  Jour de la semaine qui est normalement consacré au travail ou aux activités professionnelles et qui n&#x27;est pas un jour férié. [...] My understanding of the GDT definitions is that you cannot say jour ouvré, unless you actually work that day.   \n   \n Monday to Friday is the regular workweek/working week or schedule of workdays/working days.   \n   \n Some places open on Saturday, and other places (e.g. convenience stores) are open 7 days a week. You can be scheduled to work, or not. Those days are all ouvrables but not necessarity ouvrés (worked) by every employee on the payroll.&quot;,

About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right.

We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want [...] AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. [...] The exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group. Each row represents a different sentiment, from top to bottom: has extensive familiarity with gen AI, is comfortable using gen AI at work, provides feedback on gen AI tools, and wants to participate in the design of gen AI tools. The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each [...] Chapter 2 delves into the attitudes and perceptions of employees and leaders. Our research shows that employees are more ready for AI than their leaders imagine. In fact, they are already using AI on a regular basis; are three times more likely than leaders realize to believe that AI will replace 30 percent of their work in the next year; and are eager to gain AI skills. Still, AI optimists are only a slight majority in the workplace; a large minority (41 percent) are more apprehensive and will&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The top section of the exhibit examines the frequency of inquiries that managers field from their employees about using new gen AI tools at work. This is depicted as a horizontal bar chart showing percentages of respondents. 5 percent of managers report less than quarterly inquiries; 5 percent report quarterly inquiries; 12 percent report inquiries once a month; 15 percent report once a week; 28 percent report a few times a week; 9 percent report once a day; and 16 percent report multiple times [...] Already in 2024, our research identified about an hour of such daily activities with the technical potential to be automated. By 2030, expansion of use cases and continued improvements in AI safety could increase automation potential up to three hours per day. When people use AI-enabled tools—say, an autonomous vehicle for transportation or an interactive personal finance bot—they can repurpose time for personal fulfillment activities or being productive in other ways. [...] believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What it means for CP companies: Here, AI shatters the hype and reinvents society as a whole: how we live, how we work and how we shop. Agentic systems anticipate consumer needs, design products around them and run operations end to end. Consumers expect seamless, predictive experiences — and brands that cannot deliver disappear. The winners are those bold enough to rebuild their entire value chain around AI, re-engineering how products are made, moved, marketed and sold. [...] In this future, AI capabilities advance steadily along current trajectories, driven by incremental improvements rather than major breakthroughs. Efforts to regulate the technology are outweighed by productivity gains from humans leveraging AI. By 2030, domain-specific AI agents have achieved remarkable proficiency in operational functions across finance, HR, legal and other business areas. This evolution enables new organizational models featuring highly automated back offices and AI-augmented [...] In this scenario, the widespread adoption of advanced reasoning and agentic AI systems creates unprecedented opportunities for business innovation and value creation (via EY.com US). By 2030, enterprise-grade AI platforms have become robust, trustworthy and widely accessible, massively augmenting human capabilities and automating even complex workflows and activities across multiple domains. Democratizing AI enables organizations to completely reimagine how they work, creating lightweight and&quot;,

[...] \&quot;What we&#x27;ve done is we&#x27;ve created a very unique user experience where anybody, non-technical user, is able to create automations, agentic automations, with no prompting, no drag and drop,\&quot; explained Juhasz. \&quot;The way it works is you sit down with the agent and you collaboratively work through a task together.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;6 AI breakthroughs that will define 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Today, most AI agents operate in walled gardens, unable to communicate or collaborate with agents from other platforms. That’s about to change. By 2026, the next major frontier in enterprise AI will be interoperability—the development of open standards and protocols that allow disparate AI agents to speak to one another. Just as the API economy connected different software services, an “agent economy” will allow agents from different platforms to autonomously discover, negotiate, and exchange [...] In 2026, the biggest obstacle to scaling AI agents—the build up of errors in multi-step workflows—will be solved by self-verification. Instead of relying on human oversight for every step, AI will be equipped with internal feedback loops, allowing them to autonomously verify the accuracy of their own work and correct mistakes. This shift to self-aware, “auto-judging” agents will allow for complex, multi-hop workflows that are both reliable and scalable, moving them from a promising concept to a [...] learn from past actions and operate autonomously on complex, long-term goals. With these improvements, agents will move beyond the limitations of single interactions and provide continuous support.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Organizations should consider agentic platforms that comply with high security standards and are validated by enterprise-grade certifications such as SOC2, FedRAMP or equivalent. Further, AI agents should not be allowed free rein across an organization’s systems. At a minimum, the permissions and security scope of an AI agent must be aligned with the scope of the owner, and any tools added to the agent should not allow for extended permissions. Limiting AI agent access to a system based on [...] In conjunction, operations teams, engineers and security professionals must understand the role they play in supervising AI agents’ workflows. Each agent should be assigned a specific human owner for clearly defined oversight and accountability. Organizations must also allow any human to flag or override an AI agent’s behavior when an action has a negative outcome. [...] AI agency continues to evolve at a fast pace. However, we still need human oversight when AI agents are given the  capacity to act, make decisions and pursue a goal that may impact key systems. A human should be in the loop by default, especially for business-critical use cases and systems. The teams that use AI must understand the actions it may take and where they may need to intervene. Start conservatively and, over time, increase the level of agency given to AI agents.&quot;,

In order to utilise opportunities and avoid risks, three measures are once again key: [...] The decisive factor was an integrated approach consisting of change management, taking into account applicable legislation, communication and training, supplemented by regular lessons learnt sessions for continuous improvement. [...] 1. Regularly test algorithms: AI systems must be continuously checked for possible bias. Only through continuous evaluation can discriminatory patterns be recognised and corrected at an early stage.\n2. Ensure human control: Decisions should not be based on AI alone. Professionally qualified HR managers must evaluate, categorise and, if necessary, correct results.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI agents for HR are artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to automate and enhance various human resources functions. These agents use the advanced natural language processing techniques of large language models (LLMs) to respond to user inputs, autonomously execute HR-related workflows and perform real-time data analysis. [...] To retain top talent and continuously engage employees, leading enterprises have turned towards personalization and employee-focused service delivery models. AI agents can proactively address employee needs before they arise, helping to improve workplace culture and reduce friction across an organization. [...] AI agents automate a wide variety of HR system tasks such as payroll processing, benefits administration, scheduling, interview summarization and compliance monitoring, increasing efficiency and reducing errors. These tools can ensure compliance with company policies by flagging potential risks and suggesting corrective actions. AI self-service portals enable employees to access information and submit requests without human intervention, reducing administrative overhead.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a hybrid talent system, humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly to drive organizational outcomes. This transformation elevates HR from a traditional support function to an enterprise integrator of business strategy, technology, and human capital. It entrusts HR with reshaping the very fabric of work, talent design, culture, and operations for an AI-first world. To succeed, HR will need to reimagine the core products and services it provides, using AI to deliver even greater business [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Most strategy work (shaping talent programs, workforce design and culture, etc.) will remain human led. But AI agents can help drive or assist roughly 50% of advisory work (guiding leadership on talent opportunities and workforce risk). Agent-automated or agent-assisted work can rise to over 60% for day-to-day (functional) HR processes. And for administrative work (routine transactions, forms and reporting), AI agents can enable over 88% of HR workflows. [...] If your HR team is stuck in operational mode, you&#x27;re not alone. Too often, people spend their days managing processes instead of driving impact. AI agents can change that—fast. By taking on routine tasks, they free your team to focus where it counts: shaping culture, delivering business value and reimagining how HR works across the hire-to-retire lifecycle. [...] AI agents can deliver value quickly because they scale smoothly, reusing proven workflows, integration patterns, and agent architecture, enabling measurable impact in weeks and a new AI-powered operating model within months.&quot;,

Human resources should manage agent performance and engagement much like their human counterparts, focusing on optimizing human and digital workforce collaboration to deliver higher-touch services. [...] Agents themselves will deliver real-time performance insights on how the human-digital workforce is performing. These insights may include productivity levels, task efficiency, employee engagement, skill utilization, and collaboration metrics. For example, AI agents can provide data on which tasks are best handled by digital labor versus human talent, how well employees are adapting to new technologies, or where skill gaps might exist. Organizations can use these insights to evaluate workforce [...] AI-powered digital labor—specifically AI agents—is rapidly becoming a reality, shaking up traditional approaches to workforce planning. As digital workers integrate into the workforce, companies must shift their focus from simply filling roles to securing skills and deciding whether humans or digital entities are best suited for certain tasks. This shift poses significant implications for human resources leaders and their business stakeholders as they transition to a hybrid human-digital&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The ability to reason is growing more and more, allowing models to autonomously take actions and complete complex tasks across workflows. This is a profound step forward. As an example, in 2023, an _AI bot_ could support call center representatives by synthesizing and summarizing large volumes of data—including voice messages, text, and technical specifications—to suggest responses to customer queries. In 2025, an _AI agent_ can converse with a customer and plan the actions it will take [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, [...] Agentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input.\n\nApplication programming interface (API): Intermediary software components that allow two applications to talk to each other; a structured way for AI systems to programmatically access (usually external) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale. [...] Our research finds that the functional areas where AI presents the greatest economic potential are also those where employee outlook is lukewarm. Employees in sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, and R&amp;D contribute roughly three-quarters of AI’s total economic potential, but the self-reported optimism of employees in these functions is middling (Exhibit 14). It may be the case that these functions have piloted AI projects, leading employees to be more realistic about [...] As noted at the beginning of this chapter, employees anticipate AI will have a dramatic impact on their work. Now they would like their companies to invest in the training that will help them succeed. Nearly half of employees in our survey say they want more formal training and believe it is the best way to boost AI adoption. They also would like access to AI tools in the form of betas or pilots, and they indicate that incentives such as financial rewards and recognition can improve uptake.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The leadership role of HR in strategic AI change&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When HR systems fail, it is rarely due to the technology alone. More often, it is due to a lack of employee involvement, legal issues or a corporate culture that does not support change.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Single AI solutions are giving way to coordinated agent ecosystems,” Ramasamy says. “As business processes become more interconnected and dynamic, only multi-agent architectures can deliver the agility and resilience required to thrive in today’s environment. These systems enable specialized AI agents to collaborate seamlessly, breaking down operational silos and driving end-to-end automation across functions like finance, HR, supply chain, and customer service.” [...] “The internal productivity gains are allowing our employees to level up their work and insights and focus more time on strategic planning and execution. AI models and technologies and tools, coupled with strong professionals, operators, and employees make a powerful combination. That human in the loop is important as we look to deliver the best products and provide the right guardrails and oversight,” he says. [...] Richard says this past year his IT team found that the enterprise AI tools offered by vendors “have been super interesting and exciting and are helping our end users work in more productive ways.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the _McKinsey Talks Talent_ podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock:In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,

This will likely require an entirely new framework for managing agents that not only leans on traditional human resource management concepts for areas where agents share similarities with human workers, but also diverges to account for their unique characteristics. Some areas of focus for HR, such as workplace culture, employee loyalty, and worker motivation, won’t be applicable to agents [...] This evolution represents a fundamental reimagining of what work means, how it’s performed, and who performs it. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that AI agents and human workers have different skill sets. While agents excel at defined processes, humans remain essential for navigating the shifting ground of business requirements and complex problem-solving scenarios.\n\nThis transformation creates two primary areas that human workers are moving toward. [...] The key to success lies in recognizing that agentic transformation is not about replacing humans with machines, but about creating new forms of human-AI collaboration that leverage the unique strengths of both human and silicon-based workers. The organizations that figure out how to drive this collaboration effectively will define the future of work itself.\n\n### The jagged frontier: Ethan Mollick on AI agents in the workforce&quot;,

For example, the KPIs might include social media presence, brand recognition or how a client responds to the sponsorship events. Intangible factors matter.\n\nInvesting in women&#x27;s sport can have a positive impact on brand awareness, image and employee engagement Image: Deloitte Consulting [...] We’re at an inflection point. That’s why Deloitte is a founding member along with AT&amp;T, Capital One, and Cisco of the Athena Pledge, which aims to mobilize investment, research and opportunities in the industry and to rally other brands and companies to increase investment and support for women’s sports.\n\nThe potential of women’s sports for brand and market growth is significant. It’s time to get in the game and champion a more inclusive future in sport, for all. [...] Furthermore, by gaining greater visibility for women&#x27;s sports, companies help to create new role models for girls that can encourage them to stay in sports. Studies show that girls who play sports develop skills such as the ability to strategize, team, coach and execute, which have a tremendously positive impact on their careers later on. In a Deloitte study, 85% of surveyed women who had played sports said the skills they developed on the field and court were important to success in their&quot;,

Barriers include limited awareness of EO applications, a shortage of specialized talent, fragmented standards, and difficulty navigating the complex EO marketplace—all of which can result in limiting uptake of this technology globally.&quot;,

The EY Agentic AI in the Workplace Survey reveals a paradox: while agentic AI optimism is high, confusion and anxiety threaten to stall this transformative period in the future of work. The research also uncovered how generational differences are creating a wide managerial divide on how to lead these [...] The human readiness gap: enthusiasm meets an overwhelmed workforce\n\nAgentic AI is already delivering tangible value, with 86% of employees reporting that working with AI agents has had a positive impact on their team&#x27;s productivity. This proven success breeds confidence across the workforce: a vast majority (90%) of desk workers already using agentic AI are confident in their abilities to use AI agents today. [...] The survey, which polled more than 1,100 desk workers across six industries at companies with $1B+ in revenue in the U.S., found that 84% of employees are eager to embrace agentic AI in their roles, anticipating positive impacts on productivity, efficiency and work experience. Yet, more than half (56%) simultaneously worry about their own job security working alongside AI agents, and 51% worry that agentic AI will make their job obsolete.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the _McKinsey Talks Talent_ podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock:In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Think of a call center or store environment. You generate an agentic customer, and you say, “This is a type of call. This is a type of customer. Record an interaction.” It’s not only simulating a real phone call. You’re also getting live, detailed scoring of how you, as a frontline employee, are doing in that interaction. Are you using the right words? Have you remembered every single step of the process? It gives you very detailed coaching instructions.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve still got some hurdles to overcome. Accuracy, consistency, bias, speed, and cost are all things we need to consider carefully when implementing agentic AI within organizations. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to set clear boundaries and rules for how they operate. Just like we wouldn&#x27;t give a new employee free rein over sensitive systems, we need to control what our AI agents can access and do. [...] But to truly achieve business transformation, agents are needed. The real value of agentic AI lies in its ability to drive dramatic productivity gains and deliver a clear return on investment. By automating complex tasks and orchestrating workflows, AI agents free up employees to focus on higher-value work, leading to increased efficiency and innovation. [...] for record keeping, but also budgeting and forecasting, ensuring compliance with regulations, and delivering strategic guidance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When deployed properly, AI agents open up capacity for HR teams to be more strategic and build better relationships. Agents can handle the administrative load without requiring constant oversight, which allows HR professionals to focus on more complex, human-centric responsibilities like coaching, retention, and culture. In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them. [...] Agentic AI for HR fills the gap. It can interpret nuance, make decisions dynamically, and take initiative across multi-step processes, offloading the complexity that BPA wasn’t built to handle. For example: Agents can identify when a benefits request doesn’t follow the usual path or when a policy requires clarification and either make the adjustment itself or flag the issue to a human to handle it.\n\nSome of the areas where HR agents are already providing essential support: [...] In a world where workforce needs change quickly, HR leaders need better tools to see around corners. Agentic systems can continuously pull data from HRIS, finance, and operations tools to maintain real-time models of workforce supply and demand.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the _McKinsey Talks Talent_ podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock:In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Single AI solutions are giving way to coordinated agent ecosystems,” Ramasamy says. “As business processes become more interconnected and dynamic, only multi-agent architectures can deliver the agility and resilience required to thrive in today’s environment. These systems enable specialized AI agents to collaborate seamlessly, breaking down operational silos and driving end-to-end automation across functions like finance, HR, supply chain, and customer service.” [...] “It’s a bit surprising how quickly these tools became useful, compared to what I thought of them a little more than a year ago. I thought these tools were too clunky. But now there is a lot of exciting possibilities on the horizon with LLMs and agentic AI and integrating them into the massive data sets that organizations own,” Richard adds.\n\n## 2. ‘It’s important to keep a fast pace and experimentation mindset’ [...] Neal Ramasamy, global CIO at Cognizant, says 2025 taught him it’s time to create architecture that can support widespread agentic AI.&quot;,

In this way, agentic AI represents an opportunity to enhance employee performance, rather than replace them. [...] Agentic AI for HR fills the gap. It can interpret nuance, make decisions dynamically, and take initiative across multi-step processes, offloading the complexity that BPA wasn’t built to handle. For example: Agents can identify when a benefits request doesn’t follow the usual path or when a policy requires clarification and either make the adjustment itself or flag the issue to a human to handle it.\n\nSome of the areas where HR agents are already providing essential support: [...] In a world where workforce needs change quickly, HR leaders need better tools to see around corners. Agentic systems can continuously pull data from HRIS, finance, and operations tools to maintain real-time models of workforce supply and demand.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Enhanced employee experience\n\nAgentic AI can empower workers with instant access to personalized HR-related information, reducing wait times and improving response accuracy. Individualized AI-driven learning and development programs also help employees grow in their careers, leading to greater job satisfaction. When HR managers spend less time performing time-consuming repetitive tasks, they’re free to focus on relationship-building along with more creative strategic initiatives. [...] ### Improved, highly specific decision-making\n\nHR departments receive massive amounts of highly specific information about prospects, employees and performance—along with third-party data like compliance requirements. Whether analyzing resumes or providing HR professionals with performance insights, agentic AI can help ingest metrics and data points and help organizations make informed decisions about hiring, promotion and retention strategies.\n\n### Increased productivity [...] AI agents for HR are artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to automate and enhance various human resources functions. These agents use the advanced natural language processing techniques of large language models (LLMs) to respond to user inputs, autonomously execute HR-related workflows and perform real-time data analysis.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Despite slow take-up in HR and mixed reports about the return on investment (ROI), global executives see AI as the top business priority and the biggest potential value driver in 2025. Agentic AI is transforming company systems, processes and the workforce, and HR leaders who don’t prepare will be left behind. [...] The true power of agentic AI isn’t just in automation; it’s in augmentation. While other types of AI are excellent tools for specific tasks, agentic AI is uniquely suited to augment the workforce more broadly. Agents can mimic human reasoning, interactions and decision-making to effectively work alongside human employees, rather than just supporting them. When we blend human creativity with AI’s analytical capabilities, we create a workforce that’s greater than the sum of its parts. [...] Let’s be clear: The human and digital parts of our workforce are not the same. IT will certainly handle the more technical, tactical side of agent adoption and management. But in a climate of cyber risk, cost optimization and skills shortages, the rise of agentic AI poses new challenges and opportunities for HR to consider.\n\n###&quot;,

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Strategic workforce planning: With agentic AI, static approaches to workforce planning based on human roles will give way to dynamic, activity-based models that specify which tasks are performed by humans, AI agents, or hybrid teams. HR should reimagine workflows “AI first,” reshaping human activities and roles to optimize value from human-agent collaboration. With real-time data and analytics, HR can forecast workforce needs, identify existing and adjacent skills, and redeploy talent&quot;,

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] This tells me HR still will play a critical role in the adoption of this agentic workforce. Maybe HR will not be screening each resume, but it will be critical in driving the change management efforts in adopting an agentic AI workforce.\n\nImage 5: McKinsey Talks Talent\n\n### _McKinsey Talks Talent_ Podcast\n\nBryan Hancock, Brooke Weddle, and other talent experts help you navigate a fast-changing landscape and prepare for the future of work by making talent a competitive advantage. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

[...] As agents take on execution, people will increasingly define goals, make trade-offs, and steer outcomes. This will change how companies plan for a hybrid workforce, whom they hire (or borrow), how they deploy human or AI talent, and how they measure success. HR systems not only track human employees but also are a repository of agents and agentic workflows. Performance management anchored in task completion will give way to systems that track how well people orchestrate agents, unlock value, [...] running an end-to-end process such as onboarding a customer, launching a product, or closing the books. Agentic AI can extend the scope and autonomy of a product team more than ever.&quot;,

Now, with the rapid rise of agentic AI, organizations must continue to upskill their workforces, adapt their tech infrastructure, and deploy agent-specific governance mechanisms.

But in a climate of cyber risk, cost optimization and skills shortages, the rise of agentic AI poses new challenges and opportunities for HR to consider.\n\n### [...] This is the Year of Agentic AI — and with HR functions on track to show early achievements, the future of work is brighter than ever. Executives think AI and automation will have the biggest impact on cost optimization this year, so conversations around cost and efficiency can help secure buy-in for agents.

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down.
