  <li><strong>IBM NRF Study: AI Accelerates Transformation of Retail and Brand Decisions (Published 2026-01-07)</strong><br />
    IBM's new NRF study illustrates how AI is fundamentally altering brand and retail strategies, including driving engagement and automating the customer journey long before purchase decisions are made. Retailers are leveraging AI for marketing, personalization, inventory, and operational efficiency. These advances intersect Workday’s people analytics and operational data strengths, especially for retail customers who need to integrate workforce and operational AI. Deloitte’s Workday practice should anticipate rising demand among retail clients for agentic AI pilots and broader integrations, partnering with Workday to deliver industry-tailored solutions. <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-07-IBM-NRF-Study-Brands-and-Retailers-Navigate-a-New-Reality-as-AI-Shapes-Consumer-Decisions-Before-Shopping-Begins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a>.

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP: AI-Powered Compliance Validation in HCM</strong><br />
    SAP is actively testing and promoting AI-driven role assignment validation for HCM compliance, detailed in recent community discussions as of Jan 7, 2026. This positions SAP as a trusted AI provider in regulated industries, highlighting auditability and extensibility. For Deloitte and Workday clients, this underscores the strategic importance of reinforcing Workday’s compliance and governance features within its Skills Cloud and HCM AI stack. <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/human-capital-management-q-a/ai-powered-sap-role-assignment-validation-for-hcm-compliance/qaq-p/14303153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More on SAP HCM AI Compliance</a>; <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/beyond-the-buzz-making-sap-business-ai-work-for-the-real-world/ba-p/14303013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business AI Real World Applications</a>.<br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>ADP: Trends Signal Standardization of Agentic AI in HR Platforms</strong><br />
    ADP's end-of-year trends brief underlines that agentic AI and smart automation will soon be table stakes in enterprise HR technology. This raises the bar for Workday and ecosystem partners: clients will expect seamless, intelligent self-service and orchestration capabilities. Deloitte teams must proactively shape AI adoption strategies and accelerate Workday solution enablement with agent-centric workflows. <a href="https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2025/12/key-hr-technology-trends-for-2026-and-how-to-plan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADP 2026 Tech Trends</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI Concepts for HR</strong> — Gain hands-on knowledge of agentic HR AI, including current use cases and how to demo value to clients. <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>. <br />Expected in 90 days: Consultants can confidently launch pilot projects and client education efforts.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Workday-Microsoft Unified AI Agent Experience</strong> — Develop skills to advise on and implement cross-SaaS automation using Workday and Microsoft AI integration. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-09-16-Workday-and-Microsoft-to-Deliver-Unified-AI-Agent-Experience-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integration resource</a>.<br />Outcome: Ability to unlock cross-platform productivity for clients by Q2 2026.
  </li>
  <li><strong>AI Risk & Governance in SaaS Transformation</strong> — Understand frameworks to identify/manage AI-related compliance, privacy, and ethics risks during SaaS-driven transformation. <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/Industries/technology/blogs/managing-the-hidden-risks-of-the-next-tech-revolution.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte resource</a>.<br />Outcome: Teams are equipped to guide Workday clients through responsible AI adoption programs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Scan in-flight Workday client programs for agentic AI pilot opportunities (esp. regulated/retail sectors).</li>
  <li>Circulate SAP and ADP AI product differentiation takeaways to client-facing teams.</li>
  <li>Deliver enablement (live or recorded) on recent Workday/Microsoft AI integrations and agentic workflow capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Competitor AI launches accelerate client perception of Workday lag (esp. compliance AI).
    <br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Reinforce Deloitte-Workday AI roadmap updates and prioritize showcasing compliance automation in pilots.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Client confusion over integrating cross-SaaS agents (Workday, Microsoft Copilot, SAP, etc.).
    <br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Develop and distribute clear technical and strategic reference frameworks.
  </li>
</ul>

Ecosystem and competitor moves underscore an accelerating shift to AI-driven SaaS automation and cross-platform partnerships, which remains highly material for Workday clients and partners like Deloitte.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;IBM NRF Study: AI Accelerates Transformation of Retail and Brand Decisions (Published 2026-01-07)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IBM released a new NRF study on January 7, 2026, highlighting how artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing the way brands and retailers guide consumer decisions—beginning well before the point of purchase. According to the report, retailers and brands are deploying AI-driven insights to optimize marketing, personalize engagement, enhance inventory management, and automate significant portions of the customer journey.\\n\\nFor the Workday ecosystem, these findings are strategically relevant because Workday has been advancing its own AI and agent-based tools, especially for retail clients that use Workday for workforce management, scheduling, and talent analytics. Workday’s differentiators around people data and operational context could help it serve as the nexus for AI-driven, cross-departmental automation—from front-line staff scheduling to corporate FP&amp;A. \\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this momentum validates an increased client appetite for AI-enabled retail transformation projects, and will inevitably raise expectations for native AI capabilities, particularly in Skills Cloud and agentic HR workflows. Partners should proactively help clients define strategies for integrating Workday with broader AI investments, including retail-focused AIs from vendors like IBM or SAP.

/&gt;\\n    IBM&#x27;s new NRF study illustrates how AI is fundamentally altering brand and retail strategies, including driving engagement and automating the customer journey long before purchase decisions are made. Retailers are leveraging AI for marketing, personalization, inventory, and operational efficiency. These advances intersect Workday’s people analytics and operational data strengths, especially for retail customers who need to integrate workforce and operational AI. Deloitte’s Workday practice should anticipate rising demand among retail clients for agentic AI pilots and broader integrations, partnering with Workday to deliver industry-tailored solutions. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2026-01-07-IBM-NRF-Study-Brands-and-Retailers-Navigate-a-New-Reality-as-AI-Shapes-Consumer-Decisions-Before-Shopping-Begins\\\&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAP: AI-Powered Compliance Validation in HCM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\n    SAP is actively testing and promoting AI-driven role assignment validation for HCM compliance, detailed in recent community discussions as of Jan 7, 2026.
