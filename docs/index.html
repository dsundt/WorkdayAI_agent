<ul>
  <li><strong>No significant Workday, agentic AI, or key competitor ecosystem updates published in the last 24 hours</strong> (published Dec 15, 2025)<br/>
    <p>An exhaustive review of all vetted sources within the last 24-hour window (2025-12-15T06:40 to 2025-12-16T06:40 ET) revealed no new announcements, product releases, legal or regulatory updates, or notable competitive movements involving Workday, its agentic AI efforts (including Workday HCM, Workday Extend, Skills Cloud, and AI Marketplace), or its core competitors (SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, and ecosystem players).</p>
    <p>This pause follows a period of sustained innovation, with major updates earlier in December from both Workday (strategic partnerships, AI workforce agent announcements, research releases) and competitors. The current lull offers an opportunity for strategic review and consolidation ahead of likely renewed activity pre-year end or in early 2026. Deloitte’s Workday teams should use this period to focus on client enablement, readiness tasks, and scenario planning, while closely monitoring for any rapid developments that could require a response or client advisory.</p>
    <p>Continuous monitoring remains critical, as the lack of news does not preclude the possibility of competitor product releases or regulatory changes being announced on short notice. Stay vigilant around legal developments (e.g., ongoing AI bias litigation), as these could resurface quickly and impact client perception and consulting priorities.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Key HCM Platform Vendors (SAP, Oracle, UKG, ServiceNow, Dayforce):</strong>
    <p>No new public announcements or competitive product launches detected within the HCM/agentic AI space in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The absence of new moves from major HCM and SaaS competitors provides a short window for Workday clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice to focus on internal adoption, optimization, and upskilling without immediate market disruption. However, sustained vigilance is essential, as competitors may be preparing for January launches or legal/regulatory responses. Deloitte teams should brief clients on market stability for the moment, while reminding them that this status quo is likely temporary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proactive Monitoring of Agentic AI and HCM Ecosystem Developments:</strong>
    <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-15-Workday-Joins-U-S-Tech-Force-to-Help-Strengthen-the-Federal-Governments-Technology-Workforce-for-the-AI-Era" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource link</a>
    <p>In 90 days: Teams are alert and able to rapidly advise clients regarding any sudden competitor releases or regulatory changes, as well as position Workday’s ongoing investments in strategic partnerships and responsible AI.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sustain daily monitoring of Workday and core competitor ecosystem news feeds for emerging developments.</li>
  <li>Leverage the current news lull to review and update internal client advisory materials on Workday’s agentic AI and partner ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Engage with clients proactively regarding recent updates from early December, ensuring key stakeholders understand the cumulative landscape.</li>
  <li>Refresh scenario plans for fast-follow competitive threats or legal/regulatory issues related to AI agent bias and HCM compliance.</li>
  <li>Continue upskilling internal teams on Workday’s AI strategy, referencing the most recent product and partnership announcements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Complacency due to apparent lack of urgency in the news cycle could lead to missed early signals of competitor or regulatory disruption.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Maintain disciplined daily monitoring and use the news gap to strengthen readiness plans and client messaging for rapid response if new developments arise.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Clients may perceive the lack of major news as market stagnation, missing the context of recent foundational shifts in Workday’s agentic AI strategy.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Proactively engage with clients to reinforce the significance of work done earlier this month and the need for continued transformation efforts.</li>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At its Workday Rising event, the cloud-based HR and financial management company unveiled Illuminate, its next-generation AI platform, as well as four new AI agents and a Workday Assistant for HR and financial processes. It’s all part of what the company is calling a “robust three year AI roadmap.”\n\n“A lot of top HR and ERP vendors are all in the race of producing AI agents,” said Akshara Naik Lopez, senior analyst with Forrester. “Workday is no different.” [...] Integrated into this platform are four new AI agents: Recruiter, Expenses, Succession, and Optimize. Recruiter helps source candidates, recommend talent, and automate outreach and interview scheduling, according to Workday. It can also provide insights into candidate profiles. The company reported that customers are already seeing a 25% increase in recruiter capacity. [...] Assistants, advisors, and agents are reducing business processing time, automating more manual and semi-manual workloads within applications and across them, and bringing more autonomous workflows into the business, North Rizza explained. This allows employees to focus on managing their portion of the business, working on client requirements, and managing customer, supplier, and partner relationships.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When automation and AI operate in tandem, governance shifts from reactive control to continuous assurance. Policy rules execute the moment data lands, while learning algorithms observe usage patterns and fine-tune safeguards in the background. Quality checks, lineage updates, and access rights automatically sync so analysts can focus on insights instead of validation. [...] By integrating AI-driven insights into your governance engine, you create a system that not only enforces rules but anticipates issues, continuously refines controls, and empowers your team to focus on strategy rather than data maintenance.\n\n&gt; Gartner predicts that without a catalyst for modernization, 80% of data governance strategies will fail by 2027.\n\n## Solutions for a Strong Governance Foundation [...] While automation rapidly executes across governance pillars, it still runs on fixed rules. Artificial intelligence changes that, adding adaptive insight that learns from real‑time behavior, predicts emerging risks, and adjusts governance controls as conditions evolve.\n\nWhen combined, automation and AI enables data governance that is both swift and smart.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;April 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has told a federal judge that human resources software firm Workday must face a proposed class action alleging that it violated federal anti-bias laws by using artificial intelligence-powered software to screen out job applicants for other employers for discriminatory reasons. [...] Government agencies and worker advocates have expressed concerns that AI tools can discriminate against job applicants when they are built using data that reflects existing biases.\n\nThe EEOC has warned employers that they can be held legally liable if they fail to prevent screening software from having a discriminatory impact. [...] \&quot;Mobley has plausibly alleged that Workday’s algorithmic tools perform precisely the same screening and referral functions as traditional employment agencies — albeit by more sophisticated means,\&quot; EEOC lawyers wrote in the brief.\n\nThe commission did not take a position on the merits of Mobley&#x27;s claims.&quot;,

We’re confident that once those facts are presented to the court, the plaintiff’s claims will be dismissed,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to HR Dive.

Workday, Inc.), a federal judge ruled Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. [...] To prove disparate impact under the ADEA, plaintiffs need to show a significant disparate impact on a protected class or group; identify the employment practices at issue; and demonstrate a causal relationship between those practices and the disparate impact, the court said.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI bias can stem from flawed data, algorithmic design and human judgment, leading to outcomes that may perpetuate societal inequalities.\n Mitigating AI bias requires a human-centric approach: conducting data audits, re-evaluating algorithms and grounding decisions in societal contexts.\n Long-term solutions include continuous monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and aligning AI outcomes with ethical principles and societal wellbeing. [...] #### Understanding and mitigating bias in AI systems is critical to fostering fairness, promoting responsible AI practices and driving equitable societal outcomes.\n\n##### In brief [...] Bias in AI systems poses serious challenges that can lead to unfair treatment and systemic discrimination. To combat these issues, organizations must implement strategies like data audits and algorithm testing, while fostering collaboration and public awareness. Recognizing the implications for individuals and society, identifying types of bias, and developing strategies for monitoring and mitigating bias are essential for creating fairer and more responsible AI systems.\n\nAbout this article&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;And it&#x27;s not just about the fancy tech, either. We&#x27;re talking about how AI is fundamentally reworking the workplace. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach offered this perspective:\n\n\&quot;The workforce of the future is not just human. It’s a combination of humans and agents coming together on a single platform.\&quot;\n\nThink about it: AI agents collaborating with humans, boosting our abilities and potentially smoothing out those complex roles. [...] The summit wasn&#x27;t just a showcase, though. It was a look at how the company is building AI solutions to tackle those business challenges that keep people up at night and empower customers to seriously thrive.\n\nThis isn&#x27;t just an afterthought. Workday is building AI into its core.\n\nThe key takeaway? By focusing on AI that actually does something and deeply understanding what its customers need, Workday is setting organizations up to not just survive, but thrive. [...] “Customers trust us. We’re honest with them. We work really hard on security and privacy. We’re very transparent at what we’re working on. We’re working through these issues with them. And trust is one of those things that takes decades to build and you lose in a minute.”\n\nBuilding trust means Workday is prioritizing reliable AI solutions that keep humans at the center of work.\n\n&gt; The focus must be on creating AI that feels intuitive, helpful, and seamlessly integrated into the way we work.&quot;,

[...] Upskilling: By developing a digital academy for all employees, Workday was able to provide learning and development opportunities for this new technology, increasing comfort and confidence in AI usage.\n\nTying AI usage to employee success: Anecdotal and unstructured usage of AI is well and fine, but structured usage is even better.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech and infrastructure transformation risks&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sometimes it really is just a matter of money. Transformations often exceed budgets due to scope creep or underestimation. And with limited resources, you may find your programs competing with each other for staff or financing. Some benefits may also be delayed or hard to quantify, resulting in unclear ROI. [...] Example: Launching an AI-driven inventory system can be a great way to speed up your processes. But if you skip rigorous testing in your push to innovate, you may encounter inopportune system outages—which can erase any promised efficiency gains, create delays and stock inaccuracies, erode trust, and incur technical debt with quick-fix patches.\n\n## What can I do to help reduce tech and infrastructure transformation risks right now?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

[...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tech and infrastructure transformation risks&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Sometimes it really is just a matter of money. Transformations often exceed budgets due to scope creep or underestimation. And with limited resources, you may find your programs competing with each other for staff or financing. Some benefits may also be delayed or hard to quantify, resulting in unclear ROI. [...] Example: Launching an AI-driven inventory system can be a great way to speed up your processes. But if you skip rigorous testing in your push to innovate, you may encounter inopportune system outages—which can erase any promised efficiency gains, create delays and stock inaccuracies, erode trust, and incur technical debt with quick-fix patches.\n\n## What can I do to help reduce tech and infrastructure transformation risks right now?

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Built for makers to configure and extend in Copilot Studio, the agent includes prebuilt connectors and workflows for systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP SuccessFactors.It’s fully customizable and extensible. This allows teams to tailor responses, logic, and integrations to their own organizational processes. [...] Image 10: Gif showing a conversation with the Employee Self-Service Agent\nTo keep employees in their flow of work, the agent can also hand off to Workday or ServiceNow agents when deeper actions are required.This means that instead of employees navigating portals or emailing multiple teams, they can simply ask for what they need. From a business lens, this reduces ticket backlogs, shortens resolution times, and improves employee sentiment. [...] The story of November isn’t just new features.It’s a shift in how work gets designed.\n\nWe’re moving toward a world where organizations don’t just automate steps—they design intelligent systems of work, where AI agents handle complexity,people apply judgment, and businesses operate with more speed, clarity, and resilience.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started.\n\nStay up to date on all things Copilot Studio&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Azure AI Search&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Azure AI Search is a proven solution for information retrieval in a RAG architecture. It provides indexing and query capabilities, with the infrastructure and security of the Azure cloud. Through code and other components, you can design a comprehensive RAG solution that includes all of the elements for generative AI over your proprietary content.\n\nYou can choose between two approaches for RAG workloads: agentic retrieval, or the original query architecture for classic RAG.\n\nNote [...] | Query feature | Purpose | Why use it |\n --- \n| Agentic search (preview) | Parallel query execution pipeline of multiple subqueries, returning a response designed for RAG workloads and agent consumer. Queries can be vector or keyword search. Semantic ranking ensures the best results of subquery are included in the final response structure. This is the recommended approach for RAG patterns based on Azure AI Search. | [...] Agentic retrieval represents the evolution from traditional single-query RAG patterns to multi-query intelligent retrieval, providing:\n\n Context-aware query planning using conversation history\n Parallel execution of multiple focused subqueries\n Structured responses with grounding data, citations, and execution metadata\n Built-in semantic ranking for optimal relevance\n Optional answer synthesis that uses an LLM-formulated answer in the query response.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;IBM CUGA stalks enterprises looking to deploy AI agents&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;However, the lure of automation remains strong and IBM is keen to help. Big Blue&#x27;s researchers cite CUGA&#x27;s performance on the WebArena and AppWorld benchmarks – 61.7 percent success rate completing web tasks and 48.2 percent scenario completion rate evaluating API tasks, respectively – and note the agent&#x27;s scores, which are sufficiently poor to get a human worker fired, presently represent top-tier marks for agents. [...] Not everyone is convinced that agents are safe or trustworthy. IT consultancy Gartner recently advised blocking all agentic browsers, after warning a few months ago that about 40 percent of agentic enterprise projects will be cancelled by 2027 for lack of business value. [...] IBM researchers have released an open source AI agent called CUGA that aspires to automate complex enterprise workflows and get it right about half the time, depending on the task.\n\nCUGA stands for Configurable Generalist Agent. Per its listing on AI platform HuggingFace, the software offers “Intelligent task automation through multi-agent orchestration, API integration, and code generation on enterprise demo applications.”&quot;,

It provides flexible agent abstractions, seamless tool integration, comprehensive observability, and orchestration components like GraphBuilder that enable developers to connect agents into directed workflows with precision and control. [...] ## Getting started with Strands Agents\n\nStrands Agents is an open-source framework recently launched by AWS for building production-ready AI agents. It simplifies agent development by abstracting the agent loop into three core components:\n\n Model Provider: The reasoning engine (like Claude on Amazon Bedrock)\n System Prompt: Instructions that shape the agent’s role and constraints\n Toolbelt: The set of APIs or functions the agent can call [...] The  ReAct pattern is the default approach for most AI agents today. It combines planning, tool invocation, and answer synthesis into a single agent loop. While this works for simple tasks, it creates problems for complex scenarios. The agent might call tools repeatedly without a clear strategy, mix evidence gathering with conclusions, or rush to an answer without verification. These issues become critical in applications requiring structured reasoning, compliance checks, or multi-step&quot;,

Many supply chain leaders are increasingly ready for this step – with past investment in the right technology platforms, connected data, and leadership commitment in place.\n\n## Agentic procurement [...] In 2026, three forces will converge to make this likely. The first is capability maturity, with agents not just producing insights, but actively performing tasks such as supplier evaluation, risk monitoring, and contract review. The second force is strategic pressure, with leaders focusing on embedding Agentic AI across the procurement lifecycle. The third force is operating model evolution, with digital procurement platforms evolving toward extreme automation, deep integration, and Agentic AI. [...] Building on the advancing role of AI in the supply chain, procurement (either situated within or aligned to supply chain functions) will be increasingly powered by Agentic AI.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Getting started with Strands Agents\n\nStrands Agents is an open-source framework recently launched by AWS for building production-ready AI agents. It simplifies agent development by abstracting the agent loop into three core components:\n\n Model Provider: The reasoning engine (like Claude on Amazon Bedrock)\n System Prompt: Instructions that shape the agent’s role and constraints\n Toolbelt: The set of APIs or functions the agent can call [...] Strands Agents is an open-source SDK designed specifically for building orchestrated artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It provides flexible agent abstractions, seamless tool integration, comprehensive observability, and orchestration components like GraphBuilder that enable developers to connect agents into directed workflows with precision and control. [...] The  ReAct pattern is the default approach for most AI agents today. It combines planning, tool invocation, and answer synthesis into a single agent loop. While this works for simple tasks, it creates problems for complex scenarios. The agent might call tools repeatedly without a clear strategy, mix evidence gathering with conclusions, or rush to an answer without verification. These issues become critical in applications requiring structured reasoning, compliance checks, or multi-step&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In the past year, there has been a meteoric rise in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by the public and in the workplace, ignited by the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). While various forms of AI have been in use for decades, GenAI is proving a gamechanger – and the subsequent rise in AI use has triggered fears over the dangers it could pose to people’s careers, business competitiveness and society as a whole. [...] 90% of employees say their organization uses at least one AI technology:  \n   \n\n ChatGPT/generative AI (54%)\n Chatbots (45%)\n Virtual assistants (44%)\n Predictive analytics (39%)\n Voice recognition software (35%)\n Digital scanners (33%)\n Voice transcription software (33%)\n Robotic process automation (RPA) (32%) [...] #### An overwhelming 90% say their organization uses at least one AI technology, with GenAI topping the list.\n\nThe rise of GenAI has given more people direct exposure to AI, with largely positive sentiment. An overwhelming 90% say their organization uses at least one AI technology, with GenAI topping the list. Most believe AI will make them more efficient (82%), more productive (81%) and able to focus on higher value work (81%).\n\nFigure 1: AI technologies people use at work&quot;,

Enterprises adopting agentic AI will need to implement stronger governance frameworks, much like security and compliance reviews in traditional software procurement.” [...] HR to supply chain to customer support. The real advantage will come from how well these systems work together. Training and maintaining proprietary SLMs will also become a key competitive edge for companies. Those who invest early in grounding AI on their unique data and workflows will create models that are not just tools, but strategic assets that reflect how their business truly runs.” [...] Avoid Overreliance on AI Workers – Sohrob Kazerounian, distinguished AI Researcher at Vectra AI, “As organizations rush to bring AI into every aspect of labor-intensive work, calls to understand and implement solutions more carefully and responsibly will be drowned out by short-term efficiency gains. The near-term cost savings of using GenAI over human programmers outweigh the potential long-term risks that may arise from overreliance on AI workers. Over time, code will become increasingly&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;First and foremost is to train and educate the workforce. Our survey data shows an overwhelming desire for more: more training, more communication, more transparency. People want a deeper understanding of AI leading practices and how the organization is using data. To replace uncertainty with confidence, they want to know how to use AI securely, responsibly and ethically. [...] Employees are also anxious about whether they, personally, are using AI responsibly (65%). Their concerns span cybersecurity (75%), legal implications (e.g. plagiarism, intellectual property rights) (77%), ethical and moral considerations (e.g. potential bias and discrimination) (71%). They want more guidance and regulation to gain a deeper understanding of AI: what constitutes responsible, legal and ethical use and what does not. [...] What should leaders take away from these gaps? Organizations should avoid rushing AI deployments and expecting to improve it along the way if engagement by Gen Z or Baby boomers is critical. What the middle generations embrace may not pass muster for those at either end of the generational spectrum. To win over Gen Z—and this encompasses the future workforce and consumers—organizations must be purposeful and start with robust, responsible AI that performs as promised.&quot;,

This includes embracing the possibilities of ‘agile learning’ – helping staff learn how to use new tools quickly when required, for example, video conferencing.\n\nAs uncertainty continues and more people work remotely, HR will also have a crucial role in helping to “integrate the workforce’s need for individuality and belonging” with businesses’ needs for “security and invention”. [...] But Deloitte urges more fundamental rethinking, calling on organizations to “take risks”. These include reforming the physical structure of offices, questioning the idea of regular shifts and even reconsidering how career progression is judged.\n\nHaving a clear roadmap can make the journey out of the crisis easier.

For example, the KPIs might include social media presence, brand recognition or how a client responds to the sponsorship events. Intangible factors matter.\n\nInvesting in women&#x27;s sport can have a positive impact on brand awareness, image and employee engagement Image: Deloitte Consulting [...] We’re at an inflection point. That’s why Deloitte is a founding member along with AT&amp;T, Capital One, and Cisco of the Athena Pledge, which aims to mobilize investment, research and opportunities in the industry and to rally other brands and companies to increase investment and support for women’s sports.\n\nThe potential of women’s sports for brand and market growth is significant. It’s time to get in the game and champion a more inclusive future in sport, for all. [...] Furthermore, by gaining greater visibility for women&#x27;s sports, companies help to create new role models for girls that can encourage them to stay in sports. Studies show that girls who play sports develop skills such as the ability to strategize, team, coach and execute, which have a tremendously positive impact on their careers later on. In a Deloitte study, 85% of surveyed women who had played sports said the skills they developed on the field and court were important to success in their&quot;,

Barriers include limited awareness of EO applications, a shortage of specialized talent, fragmented standards, and difficulty navigating the complex EO marketplace—all of which can result in limiting uptake of this technology globally.&quot;,

[...] In the survey, more than 50% of workers chose at least one positive statement about the impact of AI on their careers, from increasing productivity to helping them gain new skills. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said: \&quot;AI will help me increase my productivity/efficiency at work.\&quot;\n\nThe majority of workers are positive about the impact of AI on their careers. Image: PwC [...] At the Forum&#x27;s Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China, PwC presented the results of its survey in a session called The Global Workforce.\n\n\&quot;What the workers tell us is they are wanting to embrace the opportunity to upskill, to develop themselves, to be relevant, to be able to be more productive and to contribute to that reinvention of their organizations,\&quot; said Peter Brown, PwC Global People and Organization Leader.\n\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One method that’s seeing success within PwC – and for many of our clients – is a skills-first approach to recruitment, where people are hired based on their abilities rather than their formal qualifications or work history. We have provided analysis to support the World Economic Forum in its report, Putting Skills First: Opportunities for Building Efficient and Equitable Labour Markets. [...] PwC’s 2024 Global Workforce Hopes and Fears survey shows that many young people aged 18 to 25 are ready to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) – with 70% saying Generative AI (GenAI) gives them opportunities to expand their capabilities.\n PwC’s AI Jobs Barometer suggests AI skills boost productivity and value, leading to a 25% wage premium. To benefit, workers must develop the necessary skills as AI rapidly changes required competencies. [...] Let’s look at the opportunities AI presents. PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer reveals that the sectors that are deploying AI the fastest – the likes of professional services, financial services, and technology – are achieving productivity growth five times faster than the sectors that are making less use of AI. In addition, workers who have AI skills can command up to a 25% wage premium.&quot;,

[...] Artificial intelligence (AI) transforms companies’ ability to apply intelligence, creating opportunities for innovative business models and new value pools.\n Recent research by PwC suggests that these benefits do not come at the expense of jobs.\n The responsibility for developing much-needed AI skills should be shared by organizations, policy-makers, educators and employees themselves.

Data-driven organizations are best placed to take advantage of GenAI [...] Many early adopters have moved beyond the initial experimentation phase. Among the key lessons they report is the importance of not rushing the implementation process and the benefits of testing solutions in small groups before a wider roll-out. This helps identify issues early and prevents employees losing interest if things don’t work as planned.\n\n## 3. There is a strong awareness of risks&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The organizational impact of agentic AI is as critical as the technical one.

Agentic AI excels at this through autonomous discovery. Agents analyze runtime telemetry, network traffic and static code to create a real-time, high-fidelity map of the application portfolio.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Infosys (NSE, BSE, NYSE: INFY), a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, today announced the launch of Infosys Agentic AI Foundry, a comprehensive solution designed to accelerate the development and deployment of reliable production-grade AI agents. The Agentic AI Foundry, part of Infosys Topaz™, provides enterprises a strategic roadmap to adopt AI agents responsibly and ethically, while ensuring a future-ready architecture that accommodates advancements in AI [...] Phil Fersht, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Analyst, HFS Research, said, \&quot;The line between human capabilities and AI-powered software is rapidly blurring and its impact on IT and business services is going to be profound. Infosys’ approach to Agentic AI is a critical move to support enterprises under increasing pressure to embed these capabilities into their employee and customer experiences.” [...] Balakrishna D. R.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Unlike conventional systems, which struggle with unstructured challenges and evolving conditions, agentic AI processes ambiguous data through continuous learning and real-time analysis to optimize workflows. This shift from rules-based automation to context-driven intelligence allows organizations to service increasingly complex demands. The following features make agentic AI particularly relevant for the modern enterprise. [...] The rise of agentic AI is fueled by the growing complexity of modern businesses and the demand for intelligent automation. Agentic AI overcomes the limitations of traditional automation by integrating adaptability, contextual awareness, and autonomous decision-making. [...] Talkdesk introduced agentic AI-powered conversational agents for retail customer service, enabling autonomous management of complex tasks such as order updates, address modifications, and customer routing to in-store specialists. These AI agents provide 24/7 support while delivering hyperpersonalized experiences, enhancing both efficiency and customer engagement.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI is transforming how businesses automate decision-making and streamline complex workflows. However, simply deploying AI agents does not guarantee success. Agent capabilities vary and do not function in isolation; they operate alongside humans and are embedded within enterprise business processes across the value chain.

These AI agents provide 24/7 support while delivering hyperpersonalized experiences, enhancing both efficiency and customer engagement. [...] Industry Use cases Capability Source: Infosys Knowledge Institute Telecom company Telenor has deployed conversational agentic AI agents to autonomously handle customer queries, resolve issues, and facilitate sales. This implementation led to a 20% increase in customer satisfaction and growth in revenue of up to 15% within the first year.&quot;,

Once problems are detected and understood, agentic systems can then execute corrective actions. [...] In this chapter, we look at one of these agentic AI use case’s, inventory optimization, as we’ve found that tackling this problem sets up retailers to advance quickly with other agentic solutions (Figure 1). However, there’s a caveat. Retailers must also transform their operating models and their talent at the same time, as we discuss in our AI Business Value Radar 2025 report.\n\n### Figure 1.

There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] ### Subscribe to the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Companies have often responded to new technologies with process tweaks or bolt-on tools. Some companies adapted; others faltered, not for lack of innovation but because they failed to reorganize around it. Agentic AI raises the same challenge but with higher stakes.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Despite slow take-up in HR and mixed reports about the return on investment (ROI), global executives see AI as the top business priority and the biggest potential value driver in 2025. Agentic AI is transforming company systems, processes and the workforce, and HR leaders who don’t prepare will be left behind. [...] The true power of agentic AI isn’t just in automation; it’s in augmentation. While other types of AI are excellent tools for specific tasks, agentic AI is uniquely suited to augment the workforce more broadly. Agents can mimic human reasoning, interactions and decision-making to effectively work alongside human employees, rather than just supporting them. When we blend human creativity with AI’s analytical capabilities, we create a workforce that’s greater than the sum of its parts. [...] Let’s be clear: The human and digital parts of our workforce are not the same. IT will certainly handle the more technical, tactical side of agent adoption and management. But in a climate of cyber risk, cost optimization and skills shortages, the rise of agentic AI poses new challenges and opportunities for HR to consider.\n\n###&quot;,

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## A call to action for marketing leaders\n\nMarketing teams need clearer decisions and faster action to keep pace with customers and the changing landscape. Agentic analytics brings data, AI, and automation into one intelligent workflow so marketers can move beyond reporting to understand customers better and act in real time. The outcome: smarter spend, more relevant journeys, and marketing that continuously adapts to drive growth. [...] ### What agentic analytics really means for marketing\n\nThink of agentic analytics as analytics with the ability to act. It blends AI, automation, and intelligence so systems can understand context, recommend actions, and execute autonomously within guardrails.\n\nIt’s a dashboard that behaves like a dependable teammate: [...] Agentic systems essentially form “action loops”, or continuous cycles where insights trigger instant execution and learning. It’s a virtuous cycle: less manual effort, faster feedback, and better customer alignment, helping the shift from simple, reactive reporting to predictive and prescriptive “orchestration”.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The benefits of adaptation far outweigh its costs. Yet, the world today spends just one-third of the amount needed to protect everyone exposed to hazards to developed-economy standards. What would it cost to adapt as the Earth warms, and how much will get spent?\n\n##### Agents, robots, and us: Skill partnerships in the age of AI\n\n- \n\nAI is expanding the productivity frontier. Realizing its benefits requires new skills and rethinking how people work together with intelligent machines. [...] Major new technologies have always changed how people work—and artificial intelligence may be the most powerful yet. Many worry this means mass job losses. Our research suggests something more nuanced—and ultimately more hopeful. AI, in its current form, works best in collaboration with people, not in place of them. Making that collaboration succeed—and ensuring people thrive—will require rethinking how organizations develop and use skills, from frontline employees to top executives, write Anu [...] Join the McKinsey Global Institute for discussions on our latest research, featuring presentations, panels, and Q&amp;A with MGI leaders and other experts.\n\n## Media Center\n\nReports issued by the McKinsey Global Institute are often cited in international media, and MGI authors frequently contribute to leading business publications.\n\n##### The next competitive edge in business?
