    <strong>Cognizant and Uniphore Announce Partnership to Deliver Domain-Specific AI for the Enterprise (Published 2026-02-02)</strong>
    <p>Cognizant and Uniphore have joined forces to deliver smarter, domain-specific AI solutions that blend deep conversational AI capabilities with Cognizant’s broad system integration and consulting expertise. This alliance aims to provide industry-targeted automation, including AI-enabled contact centers, intelligent agents for enterprise workflows, and business process optimization. <br> <br>Strategically, the move signals the rise of deep, verticalized AI co-developed by GSIs and specialized firms rather than just relying on hyperscaler models. For the Workday ecosystem, it means intensifying demand for intelligent, natively embedded AI agents that closely connect to HR, finance, and operations processes. For Deloitte, clients will increasingly expect more than generic enterprise AI—they will seek domain-specific, process-aware automation closely tied to SaaS platforms. <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-02-Cognizant-and-Uniphore-Partner-to-Deliver-Smarter,-Domain-Specific-AI-for-the-Enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>

    <strong>Linq Secures $20M to Enable Embedded AI Assistants Within Enterprise Messaging (Published 2026-02-02)</strong>
    <p>Linq’s $20M funding round will accelerate the deployment of native AI agents embedded in workplace messaging tools like Slack and Teams. The platform lets companies implement persistent, customizable AI personas that operate inside chat environments, directly supporting HR workflows, knowledge retrieval, approvals, and more. <br> <br>This approach exemplifies the shift toward agentic, context-aware AI that delivers real-time support and automation in the flow of work, challenging HR and SaaS vendors to enable seamless integrations. For Deloitte’s Workday-centered practice, the lesson is clear: client demand will increasingly center on intelligent workflow capabilities embedded in messaging ecosystems, demanding open APIs and rapid integration blueprints. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/linq-raises-20m-to-enable-ai-assistants-to-live-within-messaging-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cognizant & Uniphore</strong>: Announced a partnership to deliver industry-specific conversational and generative AI, targeting automation and engagement in enterprise settings. <br>
    <em>Implication:</em> Cognizant strengthens its positioning with verticalized AI, raising stakes for SaaS vendors like Workday to deepen their ecosystem’s contextual AI capabilities. Deloitte’s Workday teams must anticipate client demand for pre-built, industry-specific agentic accelerators and seamless integration options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Linq</strong>: Secured funding to further AI agent development for seamless operation inside enterprise messaging platforms. <br>
    <em>Implication:</em> This reinforces a major usability trend—expectations for agentic AI to surface directly within chat and collaboration tools. Workday offerings must evolve to become actionable within these environments, or risk disintermediation by flexible agentic middleware.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI Governance—Frameworks for SaaS and HR Technology:</strong> Deepen your knowledge using <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/artificial-intelligence/ai-masterclass/responsible-ai-governance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s AI Masterclass</a>. Outcome: Integrate responsible AI tools and regulatory considerations into every transformation engagement.</li>
  <li><strong>Latest Applications and Benefits of AI in HR:</strong> Review <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-ca/topics/ai/ai-in-hr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s latest guidance on embedded AI in HR</a>. Outcome: Communicate the value of Workday’s native AI and automation story in client conversations and RFPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI in the Modern Enterprise:</strong> Study Deloitte’s primer on <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/ca/fr/services/consulting/services/agentic-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agentic AI enablement</a>. Outcome: Advise clients on current and future-state architectures and the governance of AI agent adoption in HR, payroll, and operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Benchmark recent GSI and ISV AI partnerships for inclusion in competitive and market analysis.</li>
  <li>Evaluate client deployments for potential integration points with messaging-based agentic AI frameworks.</li>
  <li>Update client education resources to reflect the newest responsible AI governance recommendations from Workday and Deloitte.</li>
  <li>Engage with technology and client teams on readiness for agent-based interfaces in HR and finance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Competitors’ rapid advances in agentic AI may erode Workday’s differentiation.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Prioritize ecosystem integration, rapid prototyping, and monitoring GSI/ISV partnership innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Gaps in AI governance and regulation could create compliance and reputational risks for clients.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Institutionalize responsible AI governance frameworks in every advisory and transformation engagement.</li>

Workday and ecosystem leaders must closely track the maturation of enterprise agent frameworks and evolving service partnerships.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant and Uniphore Announce Partnership to Deliver Domain-Specific AI for the Enterprise (Published 2026-02-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant and Uniphore announced a major strategic partnership aiming to deliver smarter, domain-specific AI solutions across enterprise clients, with a focus on conversational and generative AI. The alliance combines Uniphore’s deep expertise in enterprise AI conversation automation with Cognizant’s consulting and system integration reach. Together, they promise to deliver tailored AI-powered solutions—such as AI-enabled contact centers, intelligent process automation, and employee service agents—to enhance business performance, customer experience, and internal operations.\\n\\nThis matters strategically because it signals a maturing trend in which GSIs no longer simply resell hyperscaler or platform-native AI capability, but invest jointly with ISVs and specialized AI firms to create verticalized and highly contextualized solutions. For the Workday ecosystem, this intensifies the race to embed, orchestrate, and operationalize intelligent workflows that are natively connected to real-world business processes. Technically, partnerships like this are likely to accelerate the integration of agentic AI and natural language processing models within HR, finance, and back-office functions, challenging traditional SaaS workflows.\\n\\nFor Deloitte and Workday clients, the move highlights the imperative to differentiate through ecosystem integration and industry-targeted AI use cases, not just broad AI enablement. Consulting partners should expect that clients will demand both technology and industry/process depth as more domain-specific, agentic AI packages become table stakes for competitive HR and operations transformation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-02-Cognizant-and-Uniphore-Partner-to-Deliver-Smarter,-Domain-Specific-AI-for-the-Enterprise\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Linq Secures $20M to Enable Embedded AI Assistants Within Enterprise Messaging (Published 2026-02-02)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Linq, a prominent AI startup, announced a $20 million fundraising round dedicated to embedding AI assistants directly into enterprise messaging platforms. Linq&#x27;s agentic AI aims to act natively within real-time collaboration environments, translating user intent into action, and automatically orchestrating complex business workflows. Their platform enables companies to build custom AI personas with persistent memory that can interact with data, process requests, and support HR or workplace processes inside common chat tools—drastically reducing friction for users.\\n\\nThis development reflects a growing recognition that the future of work will be shaped by pervasive, context-aware AI agents operating inside existing digital communication channels. For Workday and its ecosystem, Linq’s model presents both a technical opportunity to integrate with new endpoints (e.g., Teams, Slack, proprietary messaging) and a challenge, as expectations rise for seamless, proactive agentic automation rather than siloed chatbots or static integrations.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the trend points to the increasing competitive pressure to deliver AI-powered workflow solutions that are truly embedded where work happens. Clients may soon expect Workday workflows, document retrieval, approvals, and even policy guidance to occur via intelligent agents inside their messaging apps. Solution architects must prioritize open ecosystem integrations and readiness for agentic interfaces.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/linq-raises-20m-to-enable-ai-assistants-to-live-within-messaging-apps\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant &amp; Uniphore\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Announced a strategic partnership to deliver industry- and domain-specific conversational and generative AI, targeting enterprise business process automation and client engagement.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This move positions Cognizant as a leader in delivering verticalized AI solutions for enterprise clients, with the ability to closely align automation with specific industry requirements. Workday’s traditional strength in HR and financial workflows will be directly challenged if major GSIs like Cognizant make rapid progress in agentic, contextual automation.

This alliance aims to provide industry-targeted automation, including AI-enabled contact centers, intelligent agents for enterprise workflows, and business process optimization. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Strategically, the move signals the rise of deep, verticalized AI co-developed by GSIs and specialized firms rather than just relying on hyperscaler models. For the Workday ecosystem, it means intensifying demand for intelligent, natively embedded AI agents that closely connect to HR, finance, and operations processes. For Deloitte, clients will increasingly expect more than generic enterprise AI—they will seek domain-specific, process-aware automation closely tied to SaaS platforms. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-02-02-Cognizant-and-Uniphore-Partner-to-Deliver-Smarter,-Domain-Specific-AI-for-the-Enterprise\\\&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\n    &lt;strong&gt;Linq Secures $20M to Enable Embedded AI Assistants Within Enterprise Messaging (Published 2026-02-02)&lt;/strong&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Linq’s $20M funding round will accelerate the deployment of native AI agents embedded in workplace messaging tools like Slack and Teams.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Copied to clipboard\n\nWe are thrilled to announce a major milestone: the General Availability (GA) of Auth0 for AI Agents!\n\nAuth0 for AI Agents is a suite of features to empower developers to build secure agentic applications and experiences. The solution suite includes updates to: Token Vault for secure token based access to third-party APIs and applications; and Asynchronous Authorization for user approvals to keep the human in the loop for sensitive agent actions.\n\nHere are some highlights of the latest updates to the solution suite: [...] Connecting AI Agents and Third Party Apps in an enterprise introduces two key challenges: poor IT visibility into data sharing and repetitive user consent flows. Cross App Access (XAA) solves this by enabling IT teams to centralize control over these connections, eliminating constant user consent prompts and providing better governance and visibility into data sharing.\n\nThis new feature provides built-in support for SaaS providers to get their APIs ready for secure connection by AI Agents and other SaaS Apps in enterprise environments. No code changes needed, simply configure the feature in your Auth0 tenant to instantly support central policy enforcement and a seamless user experience.\n\nThis Beta release is for testing purposes only.\n\nTo learn more, read our documentation. [...] # Auth for MCP: Now in Early Access\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\nAuth0 is thrilled to announce that Auth for MCP is officially in Early Access! This release extends the power of Auth0’s standards-based authorization platform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), securing your MCP servers, MCP clients, AI agents and the APIs they interact with.\n\nWith Auth for MCP, Auth0 integrates OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect directly into the MCP ecosystem, ensuring consistent access control and auditability across every agentic interaction.\n\nKey capabilities include:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”\n\nOpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release. [...] Under the deal, Snowflake’s 12,600 customers will have access to OpenAI models across all three major cloud providers. Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products. [...] If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a $200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;OpenAI launches new macOS app for agentic coding&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.\n\nBut for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.” [...] Image Credits:OpenAI\n\nAI\n\n, at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from SWE-bench, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.

[...] Balancing autonomy with control: Organizations must also decide how much autonomy an AI agent should have. While some tasks can be fully automated, others—such as those involving financial analysis, healthcare recommendations or sensitive customer interactions—benefit from human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Determining where agents operate independently and where humans intervene is key to building intelligent systems that are both efficient and trustworthy. Finding the right balance of human intervention ensures safety without sacrificing efficiency.&quot;,

Then, the fingerprint is passed back to the Systems Manager service when the agent sends a `RegisterManagedInstance` command.\n\nLater, when sending a `RequestManagedInstanceRoleToken` command, the agent checks the fingerprint and hardware hash in the Vault to make sure that the current machine attributes match with the stored hardware hash. If the current machine attributes do match the hardware hash stored in the Vault, the agent passes in the fingerprint from the Vault to `RegisterManagedInstance`, resulting in a successful call. [...] ###### Hibernation communication behavior\n\nWhen SSM Agent enters hibernation mode, its communication pattern with the Systems Manager service changes:\n\n Normal operation: The agent regularly communicates with Systems Manager (typically every few minutes) to check for new commands and report status.\n Hibernation mode: The ping frequency starts at 5 minutes and gradually increases to once per hour by default (configurable up to 24 hours). This reduced communication frequency helps minimize unnecessary network traffic while still allowing the agent to potentially recover if conditions change.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Use the interpolation parameter to improve security\n:   For `String` type parameters in your SSM documents, use the parameter and value `interpolationType\&quot;: \&quot;ENV_VAR` to improve security against command injection attacks by treating parameter inputs as string literals rather than potentially executable commands.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Automating updates to SSM Agent - AWS Systems Manager&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Automatically updating SSM Agent\n\nYou can configure Systems Manager to automatically update SSM Agent on all Linux-based and Windows-based managed nodes in your AWS account. If you turn on this option, then Systems Manager automatically checks every two weeks for a new version of the agent. If there is a new version, then Systems Manager automatically updates the agent to the latest released version using the SSM document `AWS-UpdateSSMAgent`. We encourage you to choose this option to ensure that your managed nodes are always running the most up-to-date version of SSM Agent.\n\n###### Note [...] Automating updates to SSM Agent - AWS Systems Manager\n\nDocumentationAWS Systems ManagerUser Guide\n\nAutomatically updating SSM Agent\n\nAWS Systems Manager Change Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see AWS Systems Manager Change Manager availability change.\n\n# Automating updates to SSM Agent\n\nAWS releases a new version of AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) when we add or update Systems Manager tools. If your managed nodes use an older version of the agent, then you can&#x27;t use the new tools or benefit from the updated tools. For these reasons, we recommend that you automate the process of updating SSM Agent on your managed nodes using any of the following methods. [...] If you prefer to update SSM Agent on your managed nodes manually, you can subscribe to notifications that AWS publishes when a new version of the agent is released. For information, see Subscribing to SSM Agent notifications. After you subscribe to notifications, you can use Run Command to manually update one or more managed nodes with the latest version. For more information, see Updating the SSM Agent using Run Command.\n\n## Automatically updating SSM Agent&quot;,

Our approach to earned wage access does not disrupt a company&#x27;s payroll or time tracking process and Immediate is a zero-cost benefit to the employer. With the ADP Vantage HCM® integration, your team can begin offering EWA in as little as one hour.\nWhen the workday ends, Immediate&#x27;s AI compares employee shift history with new work log items to verify time worked. Team members then have access to their earned but not yet paid wages through the ImmediatePay app. The integration with ADP Vantage HCM® allows Immediate to see real-time data and provide an automatic deduction file for the next pay period. Immediate is then reimbursed through the payroll process. [...] The Immediate application integrates with ADP to provide earned wage access to your employees. This is a real-time integration that pushes the details to and from the Immediate platform and integrates the data in and out of ADP Vantage HCM. The Immediate integration fully automates bringing your employee census and time data to the Immediate platform in real time. Once your pay period closes the Immediate platform writes back payroll deductions to the ADP system so that it fits seamlessly into your payroll workflow.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Public community content in Engage also contributes to the grounding sources that Microsoft 365 Copilot can reference when employees ask questions across Microsoft 365 apps. Copilot understands your organization’s knowledge, drawing from conversations in public communities with citations that link directly back to the original conversation. Learn more here.\n\n### Go deeper with community scenarios [...] Communities power learning, dialogue, and engagement across the organization. They enable modern, two‑way communication between leaders and employees and help build trust at scale. With communities in Teams, these connections now happen where people already collaborate, making communication more accessible and impactful.\n\nThis integration unifies all conversation spaces in Teams—from rapid 1:1 and group chats, to collaborative project channels, to open communities that support broad connection and shared learning across the organization.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation behind the scenes. By enabling agents to work together, you can achieve higher task success rates, accuracy, and enhanced productivity. In internal benchmark testing, multi-agent collaboration has shown marked improvements compared to single-agent systems for handling complex, multi-step tasks. [...] With the fully managed multi-agent collaboration capability on Amazon Bedrock, specialized agents work within their domains of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization. [...] In Supervisor mode, the supervisor agent analyzes the input, breaking down complex problems or paraphrasing the request. It then invokes subagents either serially or in parallel, and it might consult knowledge bases or invoke action groups. After receiving responses from subagents, the supervisor agent processes them to determine if the problem is solved or if further action is needed.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] Beyond cost pressures, enterprises must also navigate data sovereignty requirements, latency constraints, intellectual property protection and system resilience. According to Deloitte Insights, the answer is not a binary choice between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, but a more deliberate, workload-driven hybrid approach that aligns technical requirements with business priorities.\n\nOrganizations that act now to modernize infrastructure and build workforce capabilities are better positioned to shape the next phase of enterprise computing. Advances in specialized chipsets, high-speed networking and intelligent workload orchestration are becoming foundational to AI at scale.\n\nHybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative [...] © 2026.

On the recruiting side, we have AI with a note taker in the interview process, which is also a coach that can give guidance to the interviewer.” [...] In addition to taking into account employees’ wants and needs, new technologies need to be accessible to employees and meet them where they are. For industrial gases company Air Liquide, which has a mix of white-collar and blue-collar employees, placing self-service within reach of all employees was crucial, says Agnès Le Guern, HR Transformation Project Director, Air Liquide. “We offer all of our employees the same level of self-service, regardless if you are in the manufacturing environment or if you are office-based,” Le Guern says. [...] Automation frees up HR leaders for more high-touch tasks, ramping up both efficiency and efficacy. It also may make traditionally error-prone processes more seamless and successful for employees. Before Mondelēz launched its onboarding automation, about three-quarters of employees’ laptops and other devices did not arrive before their start date, resulting in lost productivity and, for employees, an unfortunate first impression of their new company. Now, with automation, over 90 percent of devices are delivered by employees’ first day on the job.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nor are rising levels of graduate and youth unemployment the smoking gun that some believe. Unfortunately, young people are always the first to feel any weakening in the job market. When things start to cool, employers cut hiring first, hitting younger workers, while existing, older employees sit tight. Rates of youth unemployment are far more volatile than rates of unemployment for older workers.\n\nSo even the squeeze on tech jobs and younger workers, which at first sight looks like clear-cut evidence of the impact of AI, can be explained by more prosaic factors – the surge in business costs, a sharp rise in interest rates and the equity sell-off. [...] Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

Our commitment here is a reflection of our core values, including a focus on our employees, customer service, innovation, and integrity. [...] 2024 report Global Study Closing the AI trust gap Closing the AI Trust Gap | 2 Introduction At Workday, we believe successfully unlocking human potential with AI is only possible with a foundation of trust. The future of work starts here— with trust at the center.\nAs a values-driven organization, we’ve prioritized trust since day one. Security and protection are our top priorities when it comes to our customers’ critical data. Today, we’re committed to taking an equally trust-centric approach with Workday AI. [...] “ We know how these technologies can benefit economic opportunities for people—that’s our business. But people won’t use technologies they don’t trust. Skills are the way forward, and not only skills, but skills backed by a thoughtful, ethical, responsible implementation of AI that has regulatory safeguards that help facilitate trust. Chandler C. Morse VP, Public Policy, Workday More from this expert Our vision for AI and the future of work.\n• We develop AI technologies to amplify human potential for positive societal impact.\n• We follow a robust responsible AI framework, ensuring a deep understanding of where human intervention is needed.\n• We champion transparency and fairness and deliver on our commitment to data privacy and protection.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

Our commitment here is a reflection of our core values, including a focus on our employees, customer service, innovation, and integrity. [...] 2024 report Global Study Closing the AI trust gap Closing the AI Trust Gap | 2 Introduction At Workday, we believe successfully unlocking human potential with AI is only possible with a foundation of trust. The future of work starts here— with trust at the center.\nAs a values-driven organization, we’ve prioritized trust since day one. Security and protection are our top priorities when it comes to our customers’ critical data. Today, we’re committed to taking an equally trust-centric approach with Workday AI. [...] “ We know how these technologies can benefit economic opportunities for people—that’s our business. But people won’t use technologies they don’t trust. Skills are the way forward, and not only skills, but skills backed by a thoughtful, ethical, responsible implementation of AI that has regulatory safeguards that help facilitate trust. Chandler C. Morse VP, Public Policy, Workday More from this expert Our vision for AI and the future of work.\n• We develop AI technologies to amplify human potential for positive societal impact.\n• We follow a robust responsible AI framework, ensuring a deep understanding of where human intervention is needed.\n• We champion transparency and fairness and deliver on our commitment to data privacy and protection.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] Beyond cost pressures, enterprises must also navigate data sovereignty requirements, latency constraints, intellectual property protection and system resilience. According to Deloitte Insights, the answer is not a binary choice between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, but a more deliberate, workload-driven hybrid approach that aligns technical requirements with business priorities.\n\nOrganizations that act now to modernize infrastructure and build workforce capabilities are better positioned to shape the next phase of enterprise computing. Advances in specialized chipsets, high-speed networking and intelligent workload orchestration are becoming foundational to AI at scale.\n\nHybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative [...] © 2026.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nor are rising levels of graduate and youth unemployment the smoking gun that some believe. Unfortunately, young people are always the first to feel any weakening in the job market. When things start to cool, employers cut hiring first, hitting younger workers, while existing, older employees sit tight. Rates of youth unemployment are far more volatile than rates of unemployment for older workers.\n\nSo even the squeeze on tech jobs and younger workers, which at first sight looks like clear-cut evidence of the impact of AI, can be explained by more prosaic factors – the surge in business costs, a sharp rise in interest rates and the equity sell-off. [...] Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels.&quot;,

Our commitment here is a reflection of our core values, including a focus on our employees, customer service, innovation, and integrity. [...] 2024 report Global Study Closing the AI trust gap Closing the AI Trust Gap | 2 Introduction At Workday, we believe successfully unlocking human potential with AI is only possible with a foundation of trust. The future of work starts here— with trust at the center.\nAs a values-driven organization, we’ve prioritized trust since day one. Security and protection are our top priorities when it comes to our customers’ critical data. Today, we’re committed to taking an equally trust-centric approach with Workday AI. [...] “ We know how these technologies can benefit economic opportunities for people—that’s our business. But people won’t use technologies they don’t trust. Skills are the way forward, and not only skills, but skills backed by a thoughtful, ethical, responsible implementation of AI that has regulatory safeguards that help facilitate trust. Chandler C. Morse VP, Public Policy, Workday More from this expert Our vision for AI and the future of work.\n• We develop AI technologies to amplify human potential for positive societal impact.\n• We follow a robust responsible AI framework, ensuring a deep understanding of where human intervention is needed.\n• We champion transparency and fairness and deliver on our commitment to data privacy and protection.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Unternehmen, die diesen Übergang gestartet haben, behandeln agentenbasierte Fähigkeiten als Katalysatoren für Disziplin. Workday zum Beispiel konzentriert sich stark darauf, den Agenten die richtigen Daten bereitzustellen, die Autorität hinter den Aktionen der Agenten zu validieren und sicherzustellen, dass die Governance-Muster auf jeder Ebene konsistent sind. Ihr Ansatz unterstreicht, dass verantwortungsvolle Autonomie nur dann erreichbar ist, wenn Datenstrategie und KI-Strategie Hand in Hand gehen. [...] Wenn Führungskräfte für das nächste Jahrzehnt der KI-Innovation planen, ist die eigentliche Frage nicht mehr, ob KI ihr Unternehmen transformieren wird. Sondern vielmehr, ob die Data Governance- und Architektur-Grundlagen ihrer Organisation bereit sind, Autonomie, Handlungsfähigkeit und langfristige Performance zu unterstützen.\n\n## Vertiefende Informationen\n\nLaden Sie den vollständigen MIT Technology Review herunter und erhalten Sie detaillierte Einblicke in die Methoden, die leistungsstarke Daten- und KI-Organisationen von anderen unterscheiden.\n\nSehen Sie sich das On-Demand-Webinar an: Die Zukunft von Daten und KI erschließen, um zu erfahren, wie Führungskräfte von 3M, Workday, Reckitt und Databricks Daten, Governance und KI aufeinander abstimmen, um echte Ergebnisse zu erzielen. [...] Die KI hat sich schnell weiterentwickelt, doch nur eine kleine Gruppe von Unternehmen wandelt frühe Erfolge in einen spürbaren Vorteil um. Die meisten haben bewiesen, dass generative KI die Produktivität steigern und Arbeitsabläufe beschleunigen kann, aber weitaus weniger haben die erforderlichen Grundlagen geschaffen, um diese Wirkung im gesamten Unternehmen zu skalieren. Für leitende Technologieführungskräfte ist dies ein entscheidender Moment. Das Unterscheidungsmerkmal ist nicht mehr nur der Fortschritt allein, sondern ob Daten, Data Governance und Architektur ausgereift genug sind, um die KI-Dynamik in unternehmensweite Performance umzusetzen.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] Beyond cost pressures, enterprises must also navigate data sovereignty requirements, latency constraints, intellectual property protection and system resilience. According to Deloitte Insights, the answer is not a binary choice between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, but a more deliberate, workload-driven hybrid approach that aligns technical requirements with business priorities.\n\nOrganizations that act now to modernize infrastructure and build workforce capabilities are better positioned to shape the next phase of enterprise computing. Advances in specialized chipsets, high-speed networking and intelligent workload orchestration are becoming foundational to AI at scale.\n\nHybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative [...] © 2026.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nor are rising levels of graduate and youth unemployment the smoking gun that some believe. Unfortunately, young people are always the first to feel any weakening in the job market. When things start to cool, employers cut hiring first, hitting younger workers, while existing, older employees sit tight. Rates of youth unemployment are far more volatile than rates of unemployment for older workers.\n\nSo even the squeeze on tech jobs and younger workers, which at first sight looks like clear-cut evidence of the impact of AI, can be explained by more prosaic factors – the surge in business costs, a sharp rise in interest rates and the equity sell-off. [...] Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] The infrastructure transformation required to support AI at scale also demands significant workforce reskilling. IT teams must evolve from managing traditional servers to operating GPU clusters, high-bandwidth networks and advanced cooling systems. Network architects need to design for AI-specific traffic patterns, while cost engineers must master hybrid compute portfolio optimization and inference economics.\n\nSustainability is becoming an equally important consideration. Innovations in thermal management, advanced cooling and energy-efficient server design are improving performance per watt, while the shift of certain AI workloads to client devices such as AI-enabled PCs may help reduce overall carbon impact.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels. [...] Nor are rising levels of graduate and youth unemployment the smoking gun that some believe. Unfortunately, young people are always the first to feel any weakening in the job market. When things start to cool, employers cut hiring first, hitting younger workers, while existing, older employees sit tight. Rates of youth unemployment are far more volatile than rates of unemployment for older workers.\n\nSo even the squeeze on tech jobs and younger workers, which at first sight looks like clear-cut evidence of the impact of AI, can be explained by more prosaic factors – the surge in business costs, a sharp rise in interest rates and the equity sell-off.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Infrastructure &amp; Strategies Driving the Next Wave of ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Unternehmen, die diesen Übergang gestartet haben, behandeln agentenbasierte Fähigkeiten als Katalysatoren für Disziplin. Workday zum Beispiel konzentriert sich stark darauf, den Agenten die richtigen Daten bereitzustellen, die Autorität hinter den Aktionen der Agenten zu validieren und sicherzustellen, dass die Governance-Muster auf jeder Ebene konsistent sind. Ihr Ansatz unterstreicht, dass verantwortungsvolle Autonomie nur dann erreichbar ist, wenn Datenstrategie und KI-Strategie Hand in Hand gehen. [...] Wenn Führungskräfte für das nächste Jahrzehnt der KI-Innovation planen, ist die eigentliche Frage nicht mehr, ob KI ihr Unternehmen transformieren wird. Sondern vielmehr, ob die Data Governance- und Architektur-Grundlagen ihrer Organisation bereit sind, Autonomie, Handlungsfähigkeit und langfristige Performance zu unterstützen.\n\n## Vertiefende Informationen\n\nLaden Sie den vollständigen MIT Technology Review herunter und erhalten Sie detaillierte Einblicke in die Methoden, die leistungsstarke Daten- und KI-Organisationen von anderen unterscheiden.\n\nSehen Sie sich das On-Demand-Webinar an: Die Zukunft von Daten und KI erschließen, um zu erfahren, wie Führungskräfte von 3M, Workday, Reckitt und Databricks Daten, Governance und KI aufeinander abstimmen, um echte Ergebnisse zu erzielen. [...] Die KI hat sich schnell weiterentwickelt, doch nur eine kleine Gruppe von Unternehmen wandelt frühe Erfolge in einen spürbaren Vorteil um. Die meisten haben bewiesen, dass generative KI die Produktivität steigern und Arbeitsabläufe beschleunigen kann, aber weitaus weniger haben die erforderlichen Grundlagen geschaffen, um diese Wirkung im gesamten Unternehmen zu skalieren. Für leitende Technologieführungskräfte ist dies ein entscheidender Moment. Das Unterscheidungsmerkmal ist nicht mehr nur der Fortschritt allein, sondern ob Daten, Data Governance und Architektur ausgereift genug sind, um die KI-Dynamik in unternehmensweite Performance umzusetzen.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] Beyond cost pressures, enterprises must also navigate data sovereignty requirements, latency constraints, intellectual property protection and system resilience. According to Deloitte Insights, the answer is not a binary choice between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, but a more deliberate, workload-driven hybrid approach that aligns technical requirements with business priorities.\n\nOrganizations that act now to modernize infrastructure and build workforce capabilities are better positioned to shape the next phase of enterprise computing. Advances in specialized chipsets, high-speed networking and intelligent workload orchestration are becoming foundational to AI at scale.\n\nHybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative [...] © 2026.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nor are rising levels of graduate and youth unemployment the smoking gun that some believe. Unfortunately, young people are always the first to feel any weakening in the job market. When things start to cool, employers cut hiring first, hitting younger workers, while existing, older employees sit tight. Rates of youth unemployment are far more volatile than rates of unemployment for older workers.\n\nSo even the squeeze on tech jobs and younger workers, which at first sight looks like clear-cut evidence of the impact of AI, can be explained by more prosaic factors – the surge in business costs, a sharp rise in interest rates and the equity sell-off. [...] Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Is AI driving unemployment?&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What do the data show? The launch of ChatGPT has, indeed, been followed by rising levels of unemployment in the US, Germany, France and many other industrialised countries. Moreover, a number of US and UK studies have shown a marked weakening in employment for younger workers in AI-exposed occupations, such as software engineers, since 2022.  A Stanford analysis of private sector payroll data found, “early, large-scale evidence consistent with generative AI disproportionately impacting entry-level workers in the American labor market”. (Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about the Recent Employment Effects of Artificial Intelligence, Brynjolfsson et al, November 2025.) [...] Technology is one factor that drives the endless process of job creation and destruction, but so, too, is the economic cycle, innovation, competition, regulation and much more. The current downturn in the labour market has much more to do with the familiar, cyclical suspects, such as interest rates and inflation, than AI.\n\nAI could reshape the world of work. So far it is doing so in an undramatic fashion. A recent study by the Yale Budget Lab found that the rate of change in the mix of US jobs since the launch of ChatGPT has not been markedly different than that seen after the advent of the personal computer in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s. Not so much a case of ‘this time it’s different’ as ‘this time it’s the same’.\n\n### Stay up to date [...] It would be surprising if AI did not destroy some jobs. Most transformational technologies do. There’s never a time when some technology or innovation wasn’t reshaping work and destroying jobs. But technology also creates new types of work, and, by raising productivity and demand, fuels job growth elsewhere in the economy. Decades of rapid technological change have been accompanied by growing, not falling, employment. The number of US jobs has risen sixfold since 1900 while, in recent years, unemployment has run at exceptionally low levels.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era. No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore [...] Beyond cost pressures, enterprises must also navigate data sovereignty requirements, latency constraints, intellectual property protection and system resilience. According to Deloitte Insights, the answer is not a binary choice between cloud and on-premises infrastructure, but a more deliberate, workload-driven hybrid approach that aligns technical requirements with business priorities.\n\nOrganizations that act now to modernize infrastructure and build workforce capabilities are better positioned to shape the next phase of enterprise computing. Advances in specialized chipsets, high-speed networking and intelligent workload orchestration are becoming foundational to AI at scale.\n\nHybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### The Deloitte Global Boardroom Program\n\n### Generative AI\n\n### Deloitte’s commitment to society\n\n### Deloitte’s commitment to society\n\nSelect your location\n\nNo results found\n\n# Unleashing agentic AI’s true potential: Strategic approaches for a silicon-based workforce\n\n## Tech Trends 2026 - Trend #3&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises that have started this transition are treating agentic capabilities as catalysts for discipline. Workday, for example, focuses heavily on surfacing the right data to agents, validating the authority behind agent actions, and ensuring governance patterns are consistent at every layer. Their approach reinforces that responsible autonomy is achievable only when data strategy and AI strategy move together.\n\n3M offers another perspective. Their data and AI teams concentrate on building deeper metadata and business context before scaling agentic capabilities. By strengthening the semantic layer behind their data, they ensure that every model and agent has the clarity it needs to make dependable decisions. For them, context is not a technical detai, buta strategic asset. [...] As executives plan for the next decade of AI innovation, the real question is no longer whether AI will transform their business. It is whether their organization’s data, governance, and architectural foundations are prepared to support autonomy, action, and long-term performance.\n\n## Where to Go Deeper\n\nDownload the full MIT Technology Review for detailed insights into the practices that separate high-performing data and AI organizations from their peers.\n\nWatch the on-demand webinar: Unlocking the Future of Data and AI, to learn how leaders from 3M, Workday, Reckitt, and Databricks are aligning data, governance, and AI to deliver real outcomes.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What&#x27;s next? [...] AI has advanced quickly, yet only a small group of enterprises are converting early wins into meaningful advantage. Most have proven that generative AI can boost productivity and accelerate workflows, but far fewer have built the foundations required to scale that impact across the business. The moment facing senior technology leaders is decisive. The differentiator is no longer progress alone, but whether data, governance, and architecture are mature enough to translate AI momentum into enterprise-wide performance.&quot;,

The community agent reviews open questions and generates suggested answers based on existing organizational knowledge, and community admins can quickly approve these responses to help employees receive accurate information faster while reducing repeated questions. Learn more here. [...] ### Bring your organization together in Teams\n\nBelow are the top new capabilities, each designed to meet people where they work while supporting the full spectrum of organizational connection and communication.\n\n## A modern community layout in Teams\n\nWe&#x27;ve designed communities in Teams so that it feels native to the overall Teams experience, including a larger conversation pane, a docked right rail, and Teams-style unread indicators both in the feed and left navigation. Communities now appear in the default unified Chat app in Teams, right alongside chats and channels, so they’re visible and reachable throughout the workday. It’s easier than ever to scroll your feed, react, comment, and create posts, with the same familiarity as engaging on Engage web or app. [...] Communities power learning, dialogue, and engagement across the organization. They enable modern, two‑way communication between leaders and employees and help build trust at scale. With communities in Teams, these connections now happen where people already collaborate, making communication more accessible and impactful.\n\nThis integration unifies all conversation spaces in Teams—from rapid 1:1 and group chats, to collaborative project channels, to open communities that support broad connection and shared learning across the organization. By bringing these experiences together, we’re unlocking all-in-one value for every employee: deeper context, richer conversations, and a more connected workday.\n\n### Bring your organization together in Teams&quot;,

More hiring, but with more focus and precision, experts told HR Dive in our hiring trends piece for the year.

[...] This is less about the technology itself and more about the human-AI partnership, strategically pairing AI’s speed and scale with essential human intelligence. \n\nHR will start to play a more central role in reskilling and upskilling the workforce to focus on problem framing, critical data judgment, ethical stewardship, and decision-making. \n\nDone well, this shift will unlock a step-change in productivity and quality — enabling work that is not just faster, but smarter, more creative, and more sustainable. \n\n#### What advice would you give new CHROs who are looking to be better leaders?\n\nTry not to do everything at once.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hybrid compute becomes a strategic imperative\n\nFor many enterprises, the operational expense of AI has become a catalyst for change. Some organizations are already facing monthly AI compute costs in the tens of millions, particularly as agentic AI systems move into production.

No one is that smart or lucky to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.\n\nWorkforce transformation and sustainability come to the fore&quot;,

Fawad Butt, CEO of agentic healthcare platform maker Penguin Ai and former chief data officer at UnitedHealth Group and Kaiser Permanente, argues that traditional data governance models are structurally unfit for generative AI.\n\n“Classic governance was built for systems of record and known analytics pipelines,” he said. “That world is gone. Now you have systems creating systems — new data, new outputs, and much is done on the fly.” In that environment, point-in-time audits create false confidence. Output-focused controls miss where the real risk lives. [...] At Penguin Ai, Butt reinforced that point from a data perspective, arguing that inventories must shift from platforms to systems-in-context. An AI feature embedded in HR software and the same feature embedded in marketing automation do not carry the same risk. Treating them as identical is a governance illusion.\n\nComplyance’s Kaul added that the same principle applies externally. Vendor AI governance breaks down when enterprises accept generic assurances instead of mapping where their data actually flows. In her experience, simply forcing teams to trace AI subprocessors exposes risks that executives did not realize they had accepted.\n\n### To close the gap, CIOs must:&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How Enterprise AI Will Overcome the Last Mile&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Just think of all the elements agents need to understand a business, perform consistently, and become key elements of a daily workstream. They need context — from a CRM, service platform, data warehouse, and collaboration tools — so they can all operate from a single source of truth. They need metadata to understand the relationships between these systems, the business logic that governs data flow, and specific role-based permissions that control access. They need to be accessible in the place where work is happening. Furthermore, agentic AI isn’t just a technology implementation challenge; it’s a change-management challenge as well. Agentic AI reshapes how knowledge workers think, create, and make decisions, so it triggers organizational, cultural, and incentive-based resistance. [...] ## The Traditional Adoption Curve\n\nIn the digital era, transformative technologies have typically followed a five- to 10-year adoption curve. Consumer products often move a little faster — U.S. smartphones, for instance, reached 50% penetration just five years after the iPhone was released. But enterprise infrastructure often moves more slowly. That’s because full adoption requires internal consensus and process redesign. Cloud computing, for example, took roughly a decade to achieve mainstream acceptance after Salesforce pioneered software as a service (SaaS) in 1999. Even then, IT departments struggled to trust their data to servers they didn’t control.\n\nAgentic AI isn’t just a technology implementation challenge; it’s a change-management challenge as well. [...] Salesforce has been closing that gap ever since it launched Agentforce in 2024. Agentforce is not a separate product but an agentic layer natively integrated across the entire Salesforce product portfolio. Instead of having to stitch together dozens of point solutions or rebuild their entire infrastructure with LLMs, customers get one unified, context-aware AI-powered platform where every app is connected and every agent is grounded in the same truth.\n\nThis essential connective bridge helped the number of Agentforce customers in production increase by 70% in Q3 of this fiscal year. “Reducing the last-mile problem is something Salesforce is really focusing on with its suite of products,” said Cavalieri.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI Agent Examples Shaping The Business Landscape&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Seeing world examples of ai agents in real-world operation helps clarify what distinguishes agentic systems from more traditional automation or standalone models. In production environments, agents must operate within specific business contexts, integrate with existing data and enterprise systems, and adapt as conditions change.\n\nThe following examples of AI agents highlight how organizations across industries are applying agentic approaches to support decision-making, streamline workflows, and respond dynamically to real-time signals. Rather than showcasing generic capabilities, each example illustrates how AI agents deliver strategic value when they are grounded in domain-specific data, aligned to operational goals, and evaluated continuously to ensure reliability. [...] For teams beginning this journey—or looking to scale existing initiatives—the next step is to move from conceptual understanding to practical execution. Exploring proven frameworks, architectural patterns and real-world guidance can help organizations accelerate development while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nWant best practices to help get started? Check out the AI Agents Toolkit for a practical overview of how to design, evaluate, and operationalize agentic solutions in enterprise environments.\n\nFor a more hands-on perspective, the Build AI Agents That Work demo walks through what it takes to deploy agents that are reliable, governed and ready for production use.\n\nKeep up with us\n\nRecommended for you\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\n## Sign up [...] By grounding agents in enterprise data, pairing them with robust evaluation workflows, and enforcing governance across the full lifecycle, organizations can move beyond pilots and deploy AI agents that deliver sustained, trustworthy strategic value in production.\n\n## Real-World Examples of AI Agents in Action Across Leading Organizations\n\nAcross a wide spectrum of work, agents are quietly reshaping workflows, helping teams move faster, make more informed decisions and respond to changing conditions with a level of agility that traditional automation can&#x27;t match.&quot;,

The introduction of agentic systems that can operate independently is even more recent. It makes perfect sense for us to maintain a degree of skepticism about something that we don’t fully understand.\n\nThere’s tremendous value in having structure around agents. But something else that has value is the old idea of “trust, but verify.” Oversight builds confidence in the system by protecting our businesses, helping us learn from mistakes to ensure we don’t repeat them. Establishing a level of trust in agents provides companies with greater freedom to deploy them in more expanded ways. [...] So, yes, there’s responsibility that comes in controlling that. If we deploy agentic systems that use generative AI and let them run amok, either through hallucinations or unbounded execution, it could create chaos by leading to unintended actions. After all, the absence of governance is anarchy.\n\nOn the other hand, proper governance fosters trust and confidence in agentic systems, which in turn yields the long-term stability necessary to transform today’s hype into tomorrow’s ROI.\n\n### The Governance Checklist\n\nHere are some key technical areas to consider when managing agents.\n\nBut there is one other component to agent governance that we haven’t discussed. It’s the most important: people.\n\n### Humans in the Loop&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For complex mid-market and enterprise deals, I can see AI helping reps by preparing hyper-personalized demos, generating business cases, and coaching calls in real time. In more transactional or SMB sales, AI sales agents may take the lead — qualifying prospects, drafting proposals, and managing follow-ups without human help.\n\nThe result isn&#x27;t fewer opportunities for sellers, but a shift: Reps who learn to use AI effectively will outperform, while those who don&#x27;t risk falling behind. The competitive edge in sales will increasingly come down to how well teams adopt and apply AI.\n\n## How to choose the best AI in sales software and tools [...] ## How does AI enhance the sales process?\n\nAI enhances the sales process by giving reps greater visibility than they&#x27;ve had before. An AI agent like product.agentforce can watch your back — from spotting engaged prospects to knowing when a deal is slipping. Instead of running on instinct alone, you have help watching for the signals that matter and acting before it&#x27;s too late. [...] ## How to choose the best AI in sales software and tools\n\nChoosing the right AI-powered sales software starts with a clear understanding about the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve. The best tools work with your current workflows and are easy for reps to use.\n\nHere are some other key features and capabilities to look for:\n\nChoosing the right AI for sales platform makes the difference between another tool reps ignore and one that drives real productivity. The strongest options combine ease of use with accurate insights, giving sellers confidence in the day-to-day and leaders clarity in the pipeline. With Agentforce Sales, those capabilities are built into the CRM teams already rely on.\n\nSalesforce user smiling while on a laptop.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;What Snowflake&#x27;s deal with OpenAI tells us about ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”\n\nOpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release. [...] Under the deal, Snowflake’s 12,600 customers will have access to OpenAI models across all three major cloud providers. Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products. [...] Enterprise AI could easily become a market that contains several winners with an overlapping customer base, similar to how many ride-hail users swap between Lyft and Uber based on what makes the most sense for that moment. Case in point: Employees of these enterprises already use their preferred model regardless of their company contracts.\n\nOr maybe there will be a clear winner after all. But for now, it’s likely we are going to see enterprises ink deals with multiple players as they continue to hunt for where AI can deliver tangible value.\n\nTopics\n\nAI, Analysis, Anthropic, artificial intelligence, Enterprise, OpenAI, ServiceNow, Snowflake, TC, United States\n\nRebecca Szkutak\n\nSenior Reporter, Venture&quot;,

Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.\n\nTo continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. [...] Linq was not content with its newfound product-market-fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage was a key catalyst in the company’s refocusing on the agentic market.\n\n“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live&quot;,

Oracle Academy gives secondary and post-secondary schools and educators teaching and learning resources, including curriculum, cloud technologies, software, and hands-on labs. These resources help educators enrich the learning environment and enable students to gain skills in enterprise technologies widely used in large-scale, data-intensive systems.\n\nAI data centers are complex operations requiring diverse skills and expertise in a variety of fields. Oracle is hiring thousands of skilled employees for permanent roles at its data center locations across the country. [...] By pairing our investments in AI infrastructure with Oracle Academy programs, Oracle wants to prepare a workforce capable of applying AI to real-world challenges. We’re committed to this work as part of our long-term presence in the communities we invest. And we know that while infrastructure lays the foundation for AI’s potential, a skilled workforce ensures its success. [...] With Oracle Academy, we’re taking a long-term approach to workforce development for AI and technologies intrinsic to data center development, ongoing operations, and maintenance. As we continue to invest in AI infrastructure, Oracle Academy plans to bridge the talent gap with Data Center Technician courses. Designed to fast-track candidates directly into the frontline workforce, this specialized curriculum will benefit students across the country, including those considering future careers in Oracle’s data center communities.\n\nOur footprint is already extensive. In Texas, for example, Oracle Academy already works with more than 130 institutions and nearly 350 faculty members in areas such as computer science, accounting, civil engineering, construction management, and supply chain.&quot;,

Many HR organizations still rely on manual workarounds, fragmented technology stacks, and uneven service delivery. Without redesigning these basics, AI-driven reinvention will stall before it starts.\n   Speed 2: Embracing a Forward-Looking Ambition. This includes redesigning HR roles and operating models for an AI-first environment, embedding agents into workflows, and shaping the culture, governance, and skills required to support responsible enterprise-wide AI adoption. [...] HR’s Role in AI-Driven Organizational Change.Tasks, talent, and teams evolve as organizations progress through AI maturity. Early on, individuals use AI to speed up existing tasks without fundamentally changing workflows or roles. As organizations mature, AI becomes embedded in team processes, shifting work from manual execution to hybrid human-AI co-creation and requiring new skills in data, oversight, and system collaboration. At the highest level of maturity, AI agents orchestrate end-to-end workflows, taking on full tasks while humans supervise, set strategy, and manage exceptions. Correspondingly, roles evolve, some are phased out, and organizational structures flatten as the hybrid teams emerge. [...] Make HR one of the first enterprise areas to scaleGenAIand agents.Use HR workflows to build proof of value and internal fluency; HR must learn fast enough to teach the rest of the organization.\n   Establish AI narrative and change capabilities.Get ahead of employee concerns with the case for change focused on benefits to them (e.g., removing repetitive or routine tasks, driving impact) rather than leading with cost reductions. HR must not miss the opportunity to establish and guard employee trust.\n   Refresh skills-based strategic workforce plan for each function.Assess AI impact on roles and skills, activities, and functional organization; lead efforts to redesign 2030 labor models.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI Agent Examples Shaping The Business Landscape&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Below are examples of AI agents and how organizations are building solutions powered by agentic AI across five major sectors.\n\n## Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences: Diagnostic and Virtual Assistant Agents\n\nHealthcare workflows are information-dense, time-sensitive, and often constrained by staffing and coordination challenges. AI agents can help by automating routine intake and follow-up tasks, surfacing relevant clinical signals faster, and supporting care teams with timely, context-aware assistance—while keeping humans in control of high-stakes decisions. [...] ## Functional Capabilities of Modern AI Agents\n\nToday&#x27;s AI agent examples are far more capable than the systems that came before them. Powered by large language models, agents combine reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive learning to support complex tasks in real-world environments. When orchestrated together, multiple agents can work as a coordinated system—retrieving information, analyzing context, planning actions, and executing outcomes across multi-step workflows.\n\nHowever, technical capability alone is not enough. For AI agents to deliver meaningful business value, they must be grounded in domain intelligence—the specific data, semantics, and operational context of the organization they are supporting. [...] By grounding agents in enterprise data, pairing them with robust evaluation workflows, and enforcing governance across the full lifecycle, organizations can move beyond pilots and deploy AI agents that deliver sustained, trustworthy strategic value in production.\n\n## Real-World Examples of AI Agents in Action Across Leading Organizations\n\nAcross a wide spectrum of work, agents are quietly reshaping workflows, helping teams move faster, make more informed decisions and respond to changing conditions with a level of agility that traditional automation can&#x27;t match.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve reached peak LLM, so what&#x27;s next? System-level AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For example, do your customer service teams need past interaction context? If yes, look into options to extend your AI system capabilities, such as memory. If your teams need more in-depth analysis or troubleshooting, you probably need reasoning capabilities. If you need AIs across different departments to coordinate and take action on one issue, you may need orchestration or planning components.\n\n## Get a first look at how businesses are using AI agents\n\nExplore how agents are already helping companies across sales, service, internal operations and more.\n\nRead the free report\n\nAn illustration showing the growth in employee/agent interactions\n\nNot every AI application needs every component. Focus on what you need to solve your biggest limitations. [...] To that point, Savarese, in his article, described a semantic layer— a protocol that lets AI agents from different organizations communicate with each other – that interprets intent, verifies, and negotiates terms without human intervention.\n\n“Consider purchasing a car,” he wrote. “Your personal AI agent doesn’t just negotiate with the dealership’s agent, it simultaneously coordinates with insurance providers, lenders, and service providers, each represented by their own AI agents.”\n\nCheck out this video for an explanation of agent-to-agent collaboration.\n\nYouTube\n\n#### 4. World models\n\nLLMs are trained on text and, more recently, images and video. But we live in a three-dimensional environment, and looking at a video is not the same as understanding the real world within it. [...] ### 1. Long-term memory\n\nOne of the problems with standalone LLMs is that they’re stateless by default: Each new conversation starts without a memory of the last. It’s like Groundhog Day for data. System-level AI adds a memory architecture that remembers. This creates continuity and allows the AI to pick up exactly where the last conversation, whether with a human or an AI agent, left off.\n\nWhat might this architecture look like? Salesforce scientists, who recently wrote on the 360 blog that “without robust memory, an AI agent is like a brilliant consultant with amnesia,” have developed a “block-based extraction method that maintains the accuracy of long context (aka long conversation histories) while dramatically reducing costs.”  \n  \nThe approach works in two phases:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Managing these two agendas in parallel is imperative. AI disruption is redefining talent strategies, organizational architectures, and leadership expectations at unprecedented pace and ubiquitous scale. A recent study conducted by _MIT Sloan Management Review_ and BCG revealed that 66% of AI agentic leaders expect a redefinition of roles and responsibilities, 58% anticipate changes to governance and decision-making rights, and 45% expect to see a reduction in middle management layers. HR must build the muscle to deliver near-term reliability while advancing long-term transformation. [...] HR’s Role in AI-Driven Organizational Change.Tasks, talent, and teams evolve as organizations progress through AI maturity. Early on, individuals use AI to speed up existing tasks without fundamentally changing workflows or roles. As organizations mature, AI becomes embedded in team processes, shifting work from manual execution to hybrid human-AI co-creation and requiring new skills in data, oversight, and system collaboration. At the highest level of maturity, AI agents orchestrate end-to-end workflows, taking on full tasks while humans supervise, set strategy, and manage exceptions. Correspondingly, roles evolve, some are phased out, and organizational structures flatten as the hybrid teams emerge. [...] Forward-thinking companies are already proactively reimagining how work gets done. Some are changing traditional assumptions, defaulting to AI for work unless there is a uniquely compelling reason to hire a human. Others are merging technology and HR departments to design truly integrated teams. A few are even placing AI agents on organizational charts as full participants rather than just tools.\n\nHR leaders have both opportunity and responsibility to lead this organizational reimagining. They’re in the best position to shape AI-centric structures, take the lead on AI governance and fairness, and redefine work, talent, and the workforce. By embracing this challenge, HR can make the most of AI and help the business succeed through change.\n\nFive Actions CHROs Should Take Now&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI for Sales: 9 Ways to Use, Examples, and Benefits&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## How does AI enhance the sales process?\n\nAI enhances the sales process by giving reps greater visibility than they&#x27;ve had before. An AI agent like product.agentforce can watch your back — from spotting engaged prospects to knowing when a deal is slipping. Instead of running on instinct alone, you have help watching for the signals that matter and acting before it&#x27;s too late. [...] ### 9. Support with AI agents\n\nIn high-volume or transactional sales, AI agents handle early touches — qualifying leads, answering common questions, even scheduling meetings — and then hand off warm opportunities to reps.\n\n## Real-world examples of AI for sales\n\nI&#x27;ve seen firsthand how quickly AI can change results when it&#x27;s built into daily sales routines:\n\n## What is the future of AI for sales?\n\nThe future of AI in sales points toward leaner teams, more productive reps, and greater reliance on AI agents. Instead of large teams doing manual work, sales orgs will likely see smaller groups of \&quot;super reps\&quot; — high performers equipped with AI to handle research, forecasting, and deal management at scale. [...] For complex mid-market and enterprise deals, I can see AI helping reps by preparing hyper-personalized demos, generating business cases, and coaching calls in real time. In more transactional or SMB sales, AI sales agents may take the lead — qualifying prospects, drafting proposals, and managing follow-ups without human help.\n\nThe result isn&#x27;t fewer opportunities for sellers, but a shift: Reps who learn to use AI effectively will outperform, while those who don&#x27;t risk falling behind. The competitive edge in sales will increasingly come down to how well teams adopt and apply AI.\n\n## How to choose the best AI in sales software and tools&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Just think of all the elements agents need to understand a business, perform consistently, and become key elements of a daily workstream. They need context — from a CRM, service platform, data warehouse, and collaboration tools — so they can all operate from a single source of truth. They need metadata to understand the relationships between these systems, the business logic that governs data flow, and specific role-based permissions that control access. They need to be accessible in the place where work is happening. Furthermore, agentic AI isn’t just a technology implementation challenge; it’s a change-management challenge as well. Agentic AI reshapes how knowledge workers think, create, and make decisions, so it triggers organizational, cultural, and incentive-based resistance.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve reached peak LLM, so what&#x27;s next? System-level AI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### 1. Long-term memory\n\nOne of the problems with standalone LLMs is that they’re stateless by default: Each new conversation starts without a memory of the last. It’s like Groundhog Day for data. System-level AI adds a memory architecture that remembers. This creates continuity and allows the AI to pick up exactly where the last conversation, whether with a human or an AI agent, left off.\n\nWhat might this architecture look like? Salesforce scientists, who recently wrote on the 360 blog that “without robust memory, an AI agent is like a brilliant consultant with amnesia,” have developed a “block-based extraction method that maintains the accuracy of long context (aka long conversation histories) while dramatically reducing costs.”  \n  \nThe approach works in two phases: [...] “Going forward, it’s all about focusing less on the technology itself and more on the business problems to solve,” said Asseo.\n\nA case in point: Salesforce is using AI agents to capture lost revenue, automating the entire cold-call-to-meeting process for prospective customers who were previously slipping through the cracks.\n\n## How to prepare for the move to system-level AI\n\nUnderstanding these components is one thing. Deploying them effectively is another. Your competitive advantage will come from knowing which components to combine, when to deploy each capability, and how to orchestrate them for your business problems. [...] To that point, Savarese, in his article, described a semantic layer— a protocol that lets AI agents from different organizations communicate with each other – that interprets intent, verifies, and negotiates terms without human intervention.\n\n“Consider purchasing a car,” he wrote. “Your personal AI agent doesn’t just negotiate with the dealership’s agent, it simultaneously coordinates with insurance providers, lenders, and service providers, each represented by their own AI agents.”\n\nCheck out this video for an explanation of agent-to-agent collaboration.\n\nYouTube\n\n#### 4.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Make HR one of the first enterprise areas to scaleGenAIand agents.Use HR workflows to build proof of value and internal fluency; HR must learn fast enough to teach the rest of the organization.\n   Establish AI narrative and change capabilities.Get ahead of employee concerns with the case for change focused on benefits to them (e.g., removing repetitive or routine tasks, driving impact) rather than leading with cost reductions. HR must not miss the opportunity to establish and guard employee trust.\n   Refresh skills-based strategic workforce plan for each function.Assess AI impact on roles and skills, activities, and functional organization; lead efforts to redesign 2030 labor models. [...] Speed 1: Strengthening the Fundamentals.This includes future-proofing core HR systems, ensuring data is trustworthy, processes are consistent, and employees receive a reliable and seamless experience. Many HR organizations still rely on manual workarounds, fragmented technology stacks, and uneven service delivery. Without redesigning these basics, AI-driven reinvention will stall before it starts.\n   Speed 2: Embracing a Forward-Looking Ambition. This includes redesigning HR roles and operating models for an AI-first environment, embedding agents into workflows, and shaping the culture, governance, and skills required to support responsible enterprise-wide AI adoption. [...] HR’s Role in AI-Driven Organizational Change.Tasks, talent, and teams evolve as organizations progress through AI maturity. Early on, individuals use AI to speed up existing tasks without fundamentally changing workflows or roles. As organizations mature, AI becomes embedded in team processes, shifting work from manual execution to hybrid human-AI co-creation and requiring new skills in data, oversight, and system collaboration. At the highest level of maturity, AI agents orchestrate end-to-end workflows, taking on full tasks while humans supervise, set strategy, and manage exceptions. Correspondingly, roles evolve, some are phased out, and organizational structures flatten as the hybrid teams emerge.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The strongest organizations embedded HR more deeply into the business, grounding decisions in data, strong processes, and scalable technology — as well as increasingly drawing in talent from outside traditional backgrounds to strengthen commercial and operational capability.\n\n#### What HR trends do you predict for 2026?\n\nIn 2026, one of the defining HR trends will be a shift from treating AI as a super-tool to embedding it as a foundational layer in how work gets done.\n\nLeading organizations will move beyond automating individual tasks and start redesigning end-to-end workflows, with AI acting as a cognitive co-pilot throughout the process rather than a series of one-off solutions. [...] This is less about the technology itself and more about the human-AI partnership, strategically pairing AI’s speed and scale with essential human intelligence. \n\nHR will start to play a more central role in reskilling and upskilling the workforce to focus on problem framing, critical data judgment, ethical stewardship, and decision-making. \n\nDone well, this shift will unlock a step-change in productivity and quality — enabling work that is not just faster, but smarter, more creative, and more sustainable. \n\n#### What advice would you give new CHROs who are looking to be better leaders?\n\nTry not to do everything at once.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;OpenAI launches a Codex desktop app for macOS to run ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The Codex launch occurs as most enterprises have moved beyond single-vendor strategies. According to the Andreessen Horowitz survey, \&quot;81% now use three or more model families in testing or production, up from 68% less than a year ago.\&quot;\n\nDespite the proliferation of AI coding tools, Microsoft continues to dominate enterprise adoption through its existing relationships. \&quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot leads enterprise chat though ChatGPT has closed the gap meaningfully,\&quot; and \&quot;Github Copilot is still the coding leader for enterprises.\&quot; The survey found that \&quot;65% of enterprises noted they preferred to go with incumbent solutions when available,\&quot; citing trust, integration, and procurement simplicity. [...] The timing of OpenAI&#x27;s Codex app launch — with its focus on professional software engineering workflows — appears designed to defend the company&#x27;s position in what has become the most contested segment of the AI market: coding tools.\n\nWhy developers are abandoning their IDEs for AI agent management\n\nThe Codex app introduces a fundamentally different approach to AI-assisted coding. While previous tools like GitHub Copilot focused on autocompleting lines of code in real-time, the new application enables developers to \&quot;effortlessly manage multiple agents at once, run work in parallel, and collaborate with agents over long-running tasks.\&quot; [...] Alexander Embiricos, the product lead for Codex, explained the evolution during the press briefing by tracing the product&#x27;s lineage back to 2021, when OpenAI first introduced a model called Codex that powered GitHub Copilot.\n\n\&quot;Back then, people were using AI to write small chunks of code in their IDEs,\&quot; Embiricos said. \&quot;GPT-5 in August last year was a big jump, and then 5.2 in December was another massive jump, where people started doing longer and longer tasks, asking models to do work end to end. So what we saw is that developers, instead of working closely with the model, pair coding, they started delegating entire features.\&quot;&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;New group capabilities added: [...] Smarter Login Experience: Users can now enter either their organization name or work email on the Prompt for Organization screen. If the Organization has a verified domain, Auth0 detects the Organization instantly, loads the correct branded login, and routes the user to the right IdP.\n\nVerified Domains: Tenant admins can now associate one or more verified domains with each Organization using the new Domains tab. Verified domains power automatic organization detection and ensure HRD (Home Realm Discovery) runs only against that Organization’s enabled connections.\n\nUnified Enterprise Login Flow: This update enhances the Prompt for Organization experience for both Business and Both (Business + Individual) app types, unifying login flows across personal and enterprise users. [...] Connecting AI Agents and Third Party Apps in an enterprise introduces two key challenges: poor IT visibility into data sharing and repetitive user consent flows. Cross App Access (XAA) solves this by enabling IT teams to centralize control over these connections, eliminating constant user consent prompts and providing better governance and visibility into data sharing.\n\nThis new feature provides built-in support for SaaS providers to get their APIs ready for secure connection by AI Agents and other SaaS Apps in enterprise environments. No code changes needed, simply configure the feature in your Auth0 tenant to instantly support central policy enforcement and a seamless user experience.\n\nThis Beta release is for testing purposes only.\n\nTo learn more, read our documentation.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Managing these two agendas in parallel is imperative. AI disruption is redefining talent strategies, organizational architectures, and leadership expectations at unprecedented pace and ubiquitous scale. A recent study conducted by _MIT Sloan Management Review_ and BCG revealed that 66% of AI agentic leaders expect a redefinition of roles and responsibilities, 58% anticipate changes to governance and decision-making rights, and 45% expect to see a reduction in middle management layers. HR must build the muscle to deliver near-term reliability while advancing long-term transformation. [...] Make HR one of the first enterprise areas to scaleGenAIand agents.Use HR workflows to build proof of value and internal fluency; HR must learn fast enough to teach the rest of the organization.\n   Establish AI narrative and change capabilities.Get ahead of employee concerns with the case for change focused on benefits to them (e.g., removing repetitive or routine tasks, driving impact) rather than leading with cost reductions. HR must not miss the opportunity to establish and guard employee trust.\n   Refresh skills-based strategic workforce plan for each function.Assess AI impact on roles and skills, activities, and functional organization; lead efforts to redesign 2030 labor models. [...] HR’s Role in AI-Driven Organizational Change.Tasks, talent, and teams evolve as organizations progress through AI maturity. Early on, individuals use AI to speed up existing tasks without fundamentally changing workflows or roles. As organizations mature, AI becomes embedded in team processes, shifting work from manual execution to hybrid human-AI co-creation and requiring new skills in data, oversight, and system collaboration. At the highest level of maturity, AI agents orchestrate end-to-end workflows, taking on full tasks while humans supervise, set strategy, and manage exceptions. Correspondingly, roles evolve, some are phased out, and organizational structures flatten as the hybrid teams emerge.&quot;,

It features graph-based workflows with streaming and checkpointing, multi-agent patterns, built-in observability via OpenTelemetry, and support for multiple LLM providers. The repository includes quickstart samples, migration guides from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, and experimental labs for benchmarking and reinforcement learning.\n\n##### Storage Account: You do not have permissions to list the data using your user account with Entra ID\n\nPost by Sandro Pereira [...] ##### Upcoming Agentic Azure Logic Apps Workshops\n\nFree workshops introduce Agentic Business Processes in Azure Logic Apps, including MCP Server integrations and agent loop patterns. Sessions cover connecting the enterprise with MCP Servers from Copilot Studio and building agentic workflows in a day using Logic Apps (Standard). Registration links are provided, with dates set in January. These events help practitioners explore agent tools, orchestration patterns, and practical scenarios for intelligent automation in modern integration landscapes.\n\n# News from our community\n\n##### Enterprise AI ≠ Copilot\n\nPost by Al Ghoniem, MBA [...] |  | Upcoming Agentic Azure Logic Apps Workshops Free workshops introduce Agentic Business Processes in Azure Logic Apps, including MCP Server integrations and agent loop patterns.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;the problem differently. Also, different frameworks had incompatible approaches - some streamed only text tokens, others sent structured JSON, and most provided no visibility into critical events like tool calls or errors. The problem: No standardization across frameworks - client code that works with LangGraph won&#x27;t work with Crew AI, requiring separate implementations for each agent backend Each implementation handles tool calls differently - some send nothing during tool execution, others send unstructured messages Complex state management - clients must track conversation history, manage reconnections, and handle edge cases manually The industry needed a better solution - a common protocol that could work across all frameworks while maintaining the benefits of streaming. Phase 3: [...] typed events in real time. The beauty of AG-UI is its framework-agnostic design. While this blog post demonstrates integration with Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF), the same AG-UI protocol works with LangGraph, CrewAI, or any other compliant framework. Write your UI code once, and it works with any AG-UI-compliant backend. (Note: MAF supports both Python and .NET - this blog post focuses on the Python implementation.) TL;DR The Problem: Users don&#x27;t get real-time updates while AI agents work behind the scenes - no progress indicators, no transparency into tool calls, and no insight into what&#x27;s happening. The Solution: AG-UI is an open, event-based protocol that standardizes real-time communication between AI agents and user interfaces. Instead of each development team and framework [...] [Introduction Picture this: You&#x27;ve built an AI agent that analyzes financial data. A user uploads a quarterly report and asks: \&quot;What are the top three expense categories?\&quot; Behind the scenes, your agent parses the spreadsheet, aggregates thousands of rows, and generates visualizations. All in 20 seconds. But the user? They see a loading spinner. Nothing else. No \&quot;reading file\&quot; message, no \&quot;analyzing data\&quot; indicator, no hint that progress is being made. They start wondering: Is it frozen? Should I refresh? The problem isn&#x27;t the agent&#x27;s capabilities - it&#x27;s the communication gap between the agent running on the backend and the user interface. When agents perform multi-step reasoning, call external APIs, or execute complex tool chains, users deserve to see what&#x27;s happening. They need&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why AI adoption keeps outrunning governance&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;three runners sprinting on a bridge - one pulls ahead\n\nAcross industries, CIOs are rolling out generative AI through SaaS platforms, embedded copilots, and third-party tools at a speed that traditional governance frameworks were never designed to handle. AI now influences customer interactions, hiring decisions, financial analysis, software development, and knowledge work — often without being formally deployed in the classical sense.\n\nThe result is a widening gap between rapid AI deployment and responsible-use protections. Organizations adopt AI faster than they can govern its usage, then scramble to retrofit controls after something goes wrong. [...] ## Why legacy data governance struggles under genAI\n\nEven where governance exists, it’s often built on assumptions that no longer hold. Fawad Butt, CEO of agentic healthcare platform maker Penguin Ai and former chief data officer at UnitedHealth Group and Kaiser Permanente, argues that traditional data governance models are structurally unfit for generative AI.\n\n“Classic governance was built for systems of record and known analytics pipelines,” he said. “That world is gone. Now you have systems creating systems — new data, new outputs, and much is done on the fly.” In that environment, point-in-time audits create false confidence. Output-focused controls miss where the real risk lives. [...] What breaks first, Watson said, is data control and visibility. Employees paste sensitive information into public genAI tools, and data lineage disappears as outputs move across systems. “By the time leadership realizes what’s happening,” she said, “the data may already be gone in ways you can’t undo.”\n\nWhat to do: CIOs must move from model governance to usage governance. You may not control the model, but you can control how it’s used, what data it touches, and where outputs flow. Governance has to be embedded as tollgates inside workflows, not in policy documents that are reviewed after the fact.\n\n## Why legacy data governance struggles under genAI&quot;,

Fawad Butt, CEO of agentic healthcare platform maker Penguin Ai and former chief data officer at UnitedHealth Group and Kaiser Permanente, argues that traditional data governance models are structurally unfit for generative AI.\n\n“Classic governance was built for systems of record and known analytics pipelines,” he said. “That world is gone. Now you have systems creating systems — new data, new outputs, and much is done on the fly.” In that environment, point-in-time audits create false confidence. Output-focused controls miss where the real risk lives.&quot;,

Siemens is actively driving product innovation using generative and agentic AI, as demonstrated by its new Industrial AI agents. AI agents are also transforming manufacturing processes, smart metering, and equipment management.20 As an example of enhanced equipment management, one oil and gas company managing 1,000 pieces of critical equipment across 80 locations was able to use AI to take diagnostic information&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Generative AI can make HR more ‘human,’ not less—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;BOSTON - November 19, 2024 -The transformative impact of generative AI on the HR profession could lead to a more human touch, in addition to lower costs, according to a new study by global consultancy Bain &amp; Company.\n\nThe study suggests that selecting the right roles for automation and AI interventions could, on average, save around 15-20% in HR labor time. According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer tool, HR business partners could save up to 15% of employee time through AI; talent acquisition teams can save up to 20%; and HR operations teams up to 35%. [...] “HR is at a critical juncture. The function is under pressure to become both more cost efficient and more strategic. That is a challenging balance to strike,” said John Hazan, a partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of the firm’s Talent solution. “Generative AI has the power to elevate HR’s role in the organization, from transactional operators to strategic advisers. Our analysis suggests a typical company could save, on average, up to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and augmentation.” [...] According to Bain, HR leaders will be able to reinvent their teams’ structure and skills once transactional processes are streamlined through technology. In so doing, specialist HR advisers will become innovation hubs; HR business partners will become advisers to the business and designers of workplace culture; and operational teams will become analysts.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI poised to disrupt retail, even with 50% of consumers cautious of fully autonomous purchases—Bain &amp; Company | Bain &amp; Company&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI, which combines memory, reasoning, and tool use to act semi- or fully autonomously across the shopping journey, is ready to emerge as a retail disrupter. AI now accounts for up to 25% of referral traffic for some retailers, though it is still less than 1% of total traffic, according to Bain’s research in partnership with Similarweb. Of the three types of AI agents – third-party “objective” agents (e.g. ChatGPT, Perplexity), on-site retailer agents, and off-site retailer agents – third-party agents threaten to disintermediate retailers most. Consumers currently trust retailers’ on-site agents three times more, though the trust gap could close as more consumers try utilizing third-party agents. [...] “Agentic AI marks a major shift in retail discovery and loyalty since the rise of search engines,” said Aaron Cheris, partner in Bain’s Retail practice. “These systems are beginning to act independently across the shopping journey, from product research to checkout, creating both disruption and opportunity for retailers. This is the moment to strengthen customer relationships, build trust, and make retailer-value obvious —to humans and to algorithms alike.”\n\nWinning retailers will strategically decide how to participate in the Agentic AI emergence by either building their own agentic capabilities, or by strategically collaborating with major AI platforms, finds Bain. Agility will be crucial as the rules of engagement evolve. [...] NEW YORK—November 13, 2025—Agentic AI is poised to reshape the way consumers shop online, making agentic commerce strategies critical for retailers, Bain &amp; Company finds in a new report Agentic AI in Retail: How Autonomous Shopping Is Redefining the Customer Journey. But while shoppers increasingly use Generative AI, around half still say they are cautious about letting AI agents autonomously handle purchases from start to finish.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## What topics does Bain’s AI Masterclass cover?\n\nEach Bain AI Masterclass spotlights a trending topic in generative AI. This session focused on Agentic AI—systems where multiple “agents” collaborate to solve complex problems. We explored how this approach can accelerate client impact and streamline internal operations.\n\nThe São Paulo event began with a discussion on why Agentic AI matters in the market, exploring how it can make operations more efficient, create opportunities for new products, and reshape core business processes.\n\nThe group moved into a technical discussion before turning to two illustrative business cases based on real client work that showed the concepts in practice: [...] “I have a background in GenAI, especially with LangChain, a popular AI framework, and LangGraph, a newer extension that helps structure workflows, which are flexible but sometimes unstructured. When Bain shared their solution using Crew AI, a framework that structures collaboration among AI agents, I simply fell in love. The catchy point is that Crew AI doesn’t have a solution for human in the loop, so they embedded a LangGraph node inside Crew AI. Mixing two frameworks like that is, for me, a genius action.”\n\nEven if you haven’t worked with these frameworks before, you’ll come away with a clear sense of how Bain applies the latest generative AI in practical and creative ways.\n\n## Why is the Bain AI Masterclass valuable for recruits? [...] A Brazilian tech company using AI to help creators sell digital products like courses and e-books\n A Bain insurance client is using AI to reimagine processes in a traditionally change-resistant industry.\n\nTogether, the sample cases gave participants a sense of how broadly AI can be applied across different contexts.\n\nThe day closed with a live coding demo that spun up an agentic AI setup in real time. This step-by-step build showed how abstract frameworks can quickly become working systems and gave participants a taste of what it looks like moving from strategy to execution within a single session.\n\n## How does Bain use AI frameworks in practice?&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Figure 3\n\nAgentic AI will soon play a central role in how people shop and pay, shifting purchase behavior and potentially shifting payment profit pools. To compete in that future, financial institutions must lead with trust. That means designing experiences that are transparent, convenient, and under the consumer’s control.\n\nPublished in July 2025\n\n###### Tags [...] Decide on your role in the emerging ecosystem. Determine whether to build a proprietary agentic AI customer experience or only to be discoverable by external agents in the emerging AI ecosystem. If both, define which proprietary data and assets will remain closed to the broader ecosystem. [...] “Rebook my flight with a change fee of under $150.”\n\nPrompts like these are becoming possible for consumers as they direct AI assistants not just to search but also to make purchases on their behalf.\n\nA significant development came in 2024, when Perplexity integrated shopping features into its search results, enabling one-click purchases. By early 2025, Visa and Mastercard had joined the fray with the likes of OpenAI and Skyfire to accelerate the shift to AI-enabled and agentic payments. Equipped with integrated payment options, security, and spending limits, AI assistants will soon be able to autonomously handle product search, discovery, and purchasing decisions based on consumers’ instructions.&quot;,
