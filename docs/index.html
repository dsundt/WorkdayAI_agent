<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday Research: Enterprises Are 'Leaving AI Gains on the Table' (2026-01-14)</strong><br>
    <p>Workday’s new research, published on <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-14-New-Workday-Research-Companies-Are-Leaving-AI-Gains-on-the-Table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2026</a>, finds only 12% of surveyed organizations are fully realizing AI value—underscoring integration gaps and the need for more robust change management and skills enablement. Clients, especially those in HR and finance transformation programs with agentic SaaS, require strategies that translate AI into direct ROI. For Deloitte, these findings shape a fresh advisory/enablement agenda: become the catalyst to close this gap through advanced talent, integration, and AI adoption interventions, and ensure Workday agentic features deliver measurable business outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>WitnessAI Launches Agentic Security Solution for Enterprise AI Agents (2026-01-13)</strong><br>
    <p>The debut of <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/13/witnessai-debuts-agentic-security-enterprises-deploy-autonomous-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WitnessAI’s enterprise security platform</a> for agentic AI responds to the surge in autonomous AI adoption by delivering real-time behavioral monitoring, risk scoring, and operational guardrails. As agentic AI moves into complex workflows via Workday and similar SaaS ecosystems, risk professionals, IT, and audit leaders must adapt with robust control frameworks. This shifts the conversation for Deloitte’s Workday practice: security orchestration and risk management must become embedded elements of every agentic deployment project, to secure both adoption velocity and trust.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KPMG</strong>: Agentic AI adoption has tripled since 2024, per <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/agentic-ai-deployment-triples-despite-risks-kpmg/752270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPMG research</a> (Jan 2026). The market is demanding responsible AI deployment models and governance consulting. Deloitte and peers must now combine AI transformation skills with risk and assurance credentials to win new Workday clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Maintains its messaging around end-to-end security and explainable AI in HCM (<a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/applications/hcm/hcm-ai-advantages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product collateral</a>). Workday and partners are challenged to demonstrate agentic extensions with built-in transparency and compliance monitoring, not just base functionality.</li>
</ul>

    <em>90-day outcome:</em> Enable delivery teams to design embedded AI risk monitoring into Workday and broader agentic SaaS deployments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audit current Workday client agentic AI projects for realized value and security posture.</li>
  <li>Engage with client AI leads on outcome-based AI value realization and security enablement, using new Workday research as a diagnostic lens.</li>
  <li>Prepare guides/playbooks for embedding WitnessAI-like security controls into delivery methodology.</li>
  <li>Stay attuned to additional analyst and market commentary for rapid response to evolving agentic AI governance themes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Clients may over-invest in agentic AI with inadequate enablement, resulting in low ROI.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Lead with maturity/value assessment consulting before scaling new agentic deployments.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Security and governance gaps could halt agentic AI rollouts.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Proactively embed security monitoring and compliance frameworks into all new AI projects across the Workday ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

Meanwhile, growing concerns about AI security, cited in recent market news, signal that governance and risk management remain essential priorities for HCM and HR technology.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Research: Enterprises Are &#x27;Leaving AI Gains on the Table&#x27; (Published 2026-01-14)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday released new research on 2026-01-14 indicating that while most enterprises are eager to realize value from generative and agentic AI, a significant number have failed to implement solutions in ways that drive measurable ROI. The study found that only 12% of surveyed organizations believe they are capturing the full value of AI investments, pointing to gaps in integration, change management, and upskilling. This is strategically significant for Workday’s ecosystem because it implies that customers may need more robust platform features and consultancy support to maximize returns from advanced AI, particularly as agentic capabilities are commercialized in HCM and finance.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the findings highlight a compelling advisory opportunity: enabling clients to bridge the &#x27;AI value realization&#x27; gap through more sophisticated adoption strategies, data preparation, and talent transformation initiatives. Compared to prior years, where pilot experimentation sufficed, the market is now demanding demonstrable business impact from agentic AI workflows—raising the bar for system integrators and GSIs to deliver measurable business value alongside technical implementation. The research reinforces the importance of integrating agentic capabilities into the Workday Skills Cloud, Extend, and AI Marketplace portfolios to remain competitive in a rapidly maturing market.\\n\\nThe so-what for Workday clients and partners centers around the urgency to re-examine existing AI roadmaps and ensure that investments in agentic functionality translate directly into operational efficiency, decision intelligence, and talent optimization. GSIs such as Deloitte can build differentiated service propositions around this unmet need.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2026-01-14-New-Workday-Research-Companies-Are-Leaving-AI-Gains-on-the-Table\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;WitnessAI Launches Agentic Security Solution for Enterprise AI Agents (Published 2026-01-13)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On 2026-01-13, WitnessAI launched a new security platform specifically designed for organizations deploying autonomous AI agents. The announcement, detailed in SiliconANGLE, introduces a security monitoring and orchestration layer tailored to agentic AI at scale. This solution includes real-time risk scoring, behavioral monitoring, and guardrails for autonomous agent operations—areas that are increasingly critical as Workday and its ecosystem partners such as Deloitte move toward wider adoption of agentic and autonomous capabilities in SaaS.\\n\\nStrategically, this development is significant because it reveals a maturing market for enterprise-grade agentic security, parallel to the innovation in agentic functionality from Workday, Microsoft, and Oracle. It signals that organizations (including Workday clients) must not only focus on functional AI advancements but also proactively strengthen controls to address emerging risks like data leakage, decision bias, and unauthorized actions by autonomous systems. From a governance perspective, enterprises are being nudged to elevate their AI risk management frameworks in step with their technical deployments.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the implication is clear: ongoing client conversations about AI must incorporate up-to-date security and compliance postures. Integrators who can combine AI transformation with intelligent agent security orchestration will build trust and long-run client value. Embedded, continuous AI risk monitoring must become part of the implementation playbook for all agentic SaaS deployments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/13/witnessai-debuts-agentic-security-enterprises-deploy-autonomous-ai-agents\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG research, reported in January 2026, finds that agentic AI adoption has accelerated threefold since 2024 despite growing concerns about governance and operational risk.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;KPMG’s findings put pressure on Workday and its implementation partners to scale responsible deployment models and support customers through AI governance advisory.
