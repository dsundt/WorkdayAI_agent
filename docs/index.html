This lack of news is consistent across both Workday and key competitors (Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, Dayforce, UKG, ADP, etc.), as well as GSIs and the broader ecosystem. The holiday period is a known lull for enterprise SaaS news cycles, especially in North America and Europe. Deloitte Workday teams should anticipate a likely uptick in announcements as enterprise IT and SaaS vendors return to full activity in the first full business week of 2026. Absence of immediate news does not imply stasis in the market—rather, it suggests strategic actions and communications are likely being queued for imminent release. <a href="https://www.workday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p></li></ul><h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><strong>Market-wide</strong>: No new product updates, patent activity, or analyst notes impacting Workday competitive standing in the last 24 hours.<br /><p>All major players appear to be in a holding pattern during the holiday period.

- LAST_24H_WINDOW_ET = 2026-01-01T06:38 → 2026-01-02T06:38 inclusive

RESEARCH SCOPE
Focus on Workday and its ecosystem — Workday HCM, Workday Extend, Workday Skills Cloud, Workday AI Marketplace, and all agentic or autonomous AI capabilities in SaaS solutions. 
Include:
- Workday product developments, patents, partnerships, and leadership commentary.
- Competitive analysis (SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce, etc.).
- GSI &amp; boutique consultancy perspectives (Deloitte, Accenture, EY, KPMG, PwC, IBM, Capgemini, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, Kainos, Invisors, TopBloc, OSV, Alight, Mercer, etc.).
- Ecosystem vendors and hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Salesforce).
- Analyst &amp; media insights (Gartner, Forrester, IDC, Reuters, Bloomberg, VentureBeat, etc.).
- Emerging risks, governance, and responsible AI developments affecting SaaS/HR technology.

WRITING EXPECTATIONS
- For each cited source, provide **multi-paragraph summaries (150–250 words)** that explain:
  - What was announced, found, or claimed.
  - Why it matters strategically, technically, and competitively.
  - Implications for Workday clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice.
- Incorporate synthesis across related articles (e.g., “Across multiple GSIs…” or “Several sources indicate…”).
- Prioritize insights, nuance, and context over mere headlines.
- Every key claim must cite a valid source URL from the provided SOURCE LIST.
- If no credible items are found in the last 24h, produce an honest “no significant updates” section.

FORMATTING RULES
- Return JSON only (no Markdown or prose outside the object).
- `html_body` must be valid, minimal HTML (&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;).
- Section order: Highlights; Competitive Watch; Enablement; Actions for Next Week; Risks &amp; Mitigations; All Sources.
- Keep total HTML under 35 KB.
- `plain_text_body` must be readable text with visible URLs.

Use the following vetted sources to craft the brief.

This lack of news is consistent across both Workday and key competitors (Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, Dayforce, UKG, ADP, etc.), as well as GSIs and the broader ecosystem. The holiday period is a known lull for enterprise SaaS news cycles, especially in North America and Europe. Deloitte Workday teams should anticipate a likely uptick in announcements as enterprise IT and SaaS vendors return to full activity in the first full business week of 2026. Absence of immediate news does not imply stasis in the market—rather, it suggests strategic actions and communications are likely being queued for imminent release.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Market-wide\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;No new product updates, patent activity, or analyst notes impacting Workday competitive standing in the last 24 hours.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;All major players appear to be in a holding pattern during the holiday period.
