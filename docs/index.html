<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI Remains in Sharp Focus for Workday and Clients (Jan 28, 2026)</strong><br>
    <p>Workday’s most recent update reinforces its industry leadership in responsible AI and bias mitigation <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/responsible-ai-and-bias-mitigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(source)</a>. Workday’s approach encompasses transparent model reporting, frequent audits, and partnerships with providers like HiredScore to reduce algorithmic bias in HR decisions. This resonates with growing client, regulatory, and societal expectations for trusted AI, and positions Workday at a competitive advantage, especially for risk-conscious enterprises. Deloitte teams must be equipped to translate these responsible AI controls into client-specific value propositions—both in RFPs and go-lives—framing Workday as a compliance-friendly choice in complex sectors. These capabilities support not only risk management but also broader DEI and organizational trust objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cognizant and Cognition Announce Partnership to Scale Autonomous Software Engineering (Jan 28, 2026)</strong><br>
    <p>Cognizant and Cognition have joined forces to scale up autonomous agent-based software engineering <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-01-28-Cognizant-and-Cognition-Partner-to-Scale-Autonomous-Software-Engineering-and-Deliver-Business-Value-Across-Enterprise-Operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(source)</a>. The integration of Cognition’s AI agent technology with Cognizant’s delivery platforms is aimed at automating application development operations for enterprise clients. This represents a generational step-change in consulting and BPO, where automation is handed off to agentic AI, slashing operational costs and compressing timelines. Within the Workday space, such models raise client expectations for ‘intelligent labor’ and platform extensibility. Deloitte teams are advised to build cross-functional skillsets in agent orchestration, considering potential integration with Workday Extend and cross-SaaS ecosystems.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Resilience Identified as Key Bottleneck for Scaling AI Initiatives (Jan 28, 2026)</strong><br>
    <p>Enterprise AI transformation is being hobbled not by GPU limits, but by fragile data pipelines <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/biggest-ai-bottleneck-isnt-gpus-data-resilience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(source)</a>. The emerging consensus is that data backup, recovery, and synchronization are the hardest blockers when deploying AI at production scale, particularly in SaaS and HR transformation settings. For Workday and other HCM solutions, degraded data strength can lead to unreliable automation, compliance issues, and diminished business value. Deloitte should now mandate data resilience reviews in all AI-enabled projects, linking these to responsible AI and broader governance norms.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cognizant</strong>: Partnership with Cognition for autonomous agent deployment both accelerates delivery and opens a new consulting paradigm built on 'agentic' automation. Deloitte should evaluate compatible agentic tools for Workday environments. <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2026-01-28-Cognizant-and-Cognition-Partner-to-Scale-Autonomous-Software-Engineering-and-Deliver-Business-Value-Across-Enterprise-Operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></li>
  <li><strong>Workday</strong>: By showcasing responsible AI, Workday appeals directly to governance-minded clients. Deloitte can leverage Workday’s frameworks as a key differentiator in client engagements. <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/responsible-ai-and-bias-mitigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More info</a></li>
  <li><strong>General SaaS/AI Vendors</strong>: The pivot toward data resilience signals clients may prefer partners with proven data governance and recovery practices, shifting the focus from AI horsepower alone. Deloitte’s own Workday teams should center data resilience as a core offering. <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/biggest-ai-bottleneck-isnt-gpus-data-resilience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></li>

Deloitte’s Workday teams must track emerging agentic AI standards and ecosystem integrations as competitive intensity grows.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI Remains in Sharp Focus for Workday and Clients (Jan 28, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday continues to emphasize its commitment to responsible AI and bias mitigation, as outlined in their latest legal and compliance update. In the broader HR SaaS landscape, calls for transparency, fairness, and robust governance frameworks are rising. Workday details its proactive measures, including regular AI auditing, transparency reports, and close partnerships with third-party providers such as HiredScore to minimize algorithmic bias. These practices align with evolving client and regulatory demands for explainable and equitable AI decision-making, especially in talent processes.\\n\\nStrategically, this matters because responsible AI is increasingly a differentiator in competitive bids, particularly with enterprise buyers in regulated sectors. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the message is clear: clients expect vendors and integrators to demonstrate operational discipline, strong control frameworks, and human-in-the-loop review for all AI deployments. Advisors must articulate how Workday’s responsible AI programs reduce compliance risk and support DEI initiatives, using case studies and regulatory frameworks as validation points. This also reinforces the importance of aligning client transformation roadmaps with emerging AI governance standards.\\n\\nRead more at: https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/responsible-ai-and-bias-mitigation.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/legal/responsible-ai-and-bias-mitigation.html\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant and Cognition Announce Partnership to Scale Autonomous Software Engineering (Jan 28, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant and Cognition announced a partnership to accelerate the deployment of autonomous software engineering agents across enterprise operations. This initiative specifically draws on Cognition’s AI agent technology, integrating it into Cognizant’s digital transformation and platform engineering service lines. The move aims to deliver measurable outcomes in operational efficiency and cost optimization through end-to-end automation of software development and management workflows.\\n\\nThis development is highly consequential for the Workday ecosystem. While Workday’s own Extend platform and Skills Cloud offer AI-based extensibility, competitive GSIs are now rapidly weaving generalized AI agent frameworks into cloud transformation projects—including Workday deployments. The ramp-up in AI-driven automation could pressure Workday to enhance its agentic capabilities and open architecture. For Deloitte, this underscores the urgency of integrating advanced AI co-pilot and agent models, either natively with Workday or through approved partners, to keep pace with client expectations and competitor capability sets.\\n\\nFull story: https://news.cognizant.com/2026-01-28-Cognizant-and-Cognition-Partner-to-Scale-Autonomous-Software-Engineering-and-Deliver-Business-Value-Across-Enterprise-Operations\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-01-28-Cognizant-and-Cognition-Partner-to-Scale-Autonomous-Software-Engineering-and-Deliver-Business-Value-Across-Enterprise-Operations\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Data Resilience Identified as Key Bottleneck for Scaling AI Initiatives (Jan 28, 2026)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new analysis highlights a crucial yet often-overlooked obstacle to scaling enterprise AI: data resilience. While recent years saw a rush to invest in GPU compute and model innovation, this report underscores that sustained AI transformation increasingly depends on the reliability and recoverability of the underlying data infrastructure. Weaknesses in data backup, synchronization, and recovery frequently lead to stalled transformations and pose risks for models embedded within operational SaaS landscapes such as Workday.\\n\\nFor Workday implementations—especially when leveraging Skills Cloud, Extend, or integrating agentic AI services—inadequate data resilience can negate productivity gains and jeopardize regulatory compliance. Deloitte’s Workday practitioners should prioritize the integration of resilient data architectures in all client proposals and implementations. This perspective also links to responsible AI expectations, as robust, well-governed data environments provide the foundation for fair and compliant automation. Across the sector, there’s an emerging best practice: treat data stewardship as core to AI success, not an afterthought.\\n\\nSee the full piece: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/biggest-ai-bottleneck-isnt-gpus-data-resilience\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/biggest-ai-bottleneck-isnt-gpus-data-resilience\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Partnership with Cognition to deliver autonomous software engineering agents and enhance automation of enterprise cloud operations.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This creates a more automated, &#x27;agentic&#x27; consultancy model for cloud and SaaS transformations that can potentially accelerate delivery and reduce costs for clients. For Workday practices, this raises the stakes to embed agent-driven orchestration and demonstrate business value beyond traditional ERP/HCM integration models. Deloitte teams should evaluate agentic frameworks and prebuilt AI accelerators as potential competitive countermeasures.

Workday’s approach encompasses transparent model reporting, frequent audits, and partnerships with providers like HiredScore to reduce algorithmic bias in HR decisions. This resonates with growing client, regulatory, and societal expectations for trusted AI, and positions Workday at a competitive advantage, especially for risk-conscious enterprises. Deloitte teams must be equipped to translate these responsible AI controls into client-specific value propositions—both in RFPs and go-lives—framing Workday as a compliance-friendly choice in complex sectors. These capabilities support not only risk management but also broader DEI and organizational trust objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognizant and Cognition Announce Partnership to Scale Autonomous Software Engineering (Jan 28, 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Cognizant and Cognition have joined forces to scale up autonomous agent-based software engineering &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2026-01-28-Cognizant-and-Cognition-Partner-to-Scale-Autonomous-Software-Engineering-and-Deliver-Business-Value-Across-Enterprise-Operations\\\&quot;&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;. The integration of Cognition’s AI agent technology with Cognizant’s delivery platforms is aimed at automating application development operations for enterprise clients. This represents a generational step-change in consulting and BPO, where automation is handed off to agentic AI, slashing operational costs and compressing timelines. Within the Workday space, such models raise client expectations for ‘intelligent labor’ and platform extensibility. Deloitte teams are advised to build cross-functional skillsets in agent orchestration, considering potential integration with Workday Extend and cross-SaaS ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Resilience Identified as Key Bottleneck for Scaling AI Initiatives (Jan 28, 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\n    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise AI transformation is being hobbled not by GPU limits, but by fragile data pipelines &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/28/biggest-ai-bottleneck-isnt-gpus-data-resilience\\\&quot;&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;. The emerging consensus is that data backup, recovery, and synchronization are the hardest blockers when deploying AI at production scale, particularly in SaaS and HR transformation settings. For Workday and other HCM solutions, degraded data strength can lead to unreliable automation, compliance issues, and diminished business value. Deloitte should now mandate data resilience reviews in all AI-enabled projects, linking these to responsible AI and broader governance norms.&lt;/p&gt;\\n  &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognizant&lt;/strong&gt;: Partnership with Cognition for autonomous agent deployment both accelerates delivery and opens a new consulting paradigm built on &#x27;agentic&#x27; automation.
