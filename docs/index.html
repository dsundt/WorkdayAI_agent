DATE CONTEXT (ET):
- TODAY_ET = 2025-10-16

Topic scope: Workday; Workday HCM (Human Capital Management); Workday AI; agentic AI for Workday; broader AI for HR technology; consultant upskilling; SI/GSI (Systems Integrators / Global Systems Integrators) competitive moves.

Rules for DAILY brief:
- Target ~250 words total.
- Prefer items published in the LAST_48H_WINDOW (from 2025-10-15 to 2025-10-16). If nothing relevant exists, choose the most recent credible items and explicitly say “No material items in last 48 hours; including nearest recent updates.”
- For every item, include a working public URL and state why it matters to Deloitte’s Workday practice (client conversations, offering strategy, enablement, competitive posture).
- Include the publication date for each “highlight” item in its text (e.g., “(Published: 2025-10-15)”).

Rendering constraints:
- Return JSON only (no prose, no Markdown, no code fences).
- The “html_body” must be valid minimal HTML with semantic tags and absolute links:
  - Use &lt;h2&gt; for the headline, &lt;h3&gt; for section headers, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://…&quot;&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;
  - No &lt;script&gt;, no external CSS, no images, no iframes.
  - Short paragraphs and bullet lists for readability.
- The “plain_text_body” must be a text-only version with full URLs visible.

Return JSON ONLY in this exact shape (no code fences, no extra text):
