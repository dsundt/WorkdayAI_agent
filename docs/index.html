<ul>
<li><strong>IBM Study Shows CDOs Seek to Align Data Strategies With Outpacing AI Ambitions (Nov 13, 2025)</strong><br />
A new <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-13-IBM-Study-Chief-Data-Officers-Redefine-Strategies-as-AI-Ambitions-Outpace-Readiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM study</a> reveals Chief Data Officers are facing mounting challenges as enterprise AI ambitions, especially for agentic AI, race ahead of current data and governance maturity. For Workday-focused organizations, this exposes the need to strengthen data practices for AI success and trust, making data readiness consulting a strategic pillar for Deloitte’s Workday teams.</li>
<li><strong>People-First AI Demonstrated to Amplify Cultural Change and Results (Nov 12, 2025)</strong><br />
SiliconANGLE’s coverage of <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/12/people-first-ai-transforms-culture-results-refresh2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people-first AI initiatives</a> shows that agentic AI, designed to augment and empower workers rather than just automate, delivers significantly higher organizational engagement and successful digital transformation. Workday’s agentic AI approach and Deloitte’s EX analysis are validated, putting an emphasis on change management and practitioner enablement alongside technology delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Cognizant Named Major Player in 2025 IDC MarketScape for Canadian AI Services (Nov 12, 2025)</strong><br />
According to the latest IDC MarketScape (as highlighted in <a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognizant's press release</a>), Cognizant’s advanced AI consulting and cross-platform delivery credence now directly challenges GSIs in both technical and outcome-driven services for Workday and adjacent SaaS deployments. Practical differentiation and value-based outcomes will be core for Deloitte in winning future Workday-led AI engagements in the region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognizant</strong>: Recently recognized as a major player in IDC’s Canadian AI services MarketScape (<a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>), highlighting growing competition in Workday transformation and AI deployment, particularly on cross-platform and managed services. Deloitte should heighten messaging on data governance and value delivery.
</li>
<li><strong>IBM</strong>: Published new research (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-13-IBM-Study-Chief-Data-Officers-Redefine-Strategies-as-AI-Ambitions-Outpace-Readiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>) identifying client gaps in governance and data as a top challenge for unlocking Workday and SaaS AI value. This bolsters the return-on-governance argument for Deloitte.
</li>
<li><strong>Dayforce</strong>: Ongoing investment in AI-enhanced people operations keeps the bar high for agentic assistant features and EX transformation. See <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/how-we-help/dayforce/leverage-ai-for-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dayforce AI-Enhanced People Operations</a> for details.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Readiness & AI Governance</strong>: Study and adopt frameworks for client data readiness and AI governance advising (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-13-IBM-Study-Chief-Data-Officers-Redefine-Strategies-as-AI-Ambitions-Outpace-Readiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Study</a>). Outcome: Ability to scope risk mitigation and readiness in every Workday AI engagement.</li>
<li><strong>AI Change Enablement & EX Transformation</strong>: Prioritize people-first AI enablement and adoption measurement (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/12/people-first-ai-transforms-culture-results-refresh2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiliconANGLE</a>). Outcome: Enhanced project success via adoption and engagement metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Positioning</strong>: Develop clear competitor messaging (<a href="https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognizant IDC</a>). Outcome: Improved pre-sales and advisory effectiveness.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update all client-facing material and internal playbooks to reflect the elevated importance of data governance in Workday AI rollouts.</li>
<li>Host EX-centric AI enablement workshops leveraging proven culture/behavior metrics from recent agentic AI deployments.</li>
<li>Develop a Canada/North America competition response playbook, leveraging Cognizant’s IDC ranking and Deloitte’s strengths.</li>
<li>Review current implementations for potential data/integration bottlenecks limiting agent functionality or client satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data & Governance Gaps</strong>: Mitigate by conducting data readiness and governance advisory as a project gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Mindshare Loss</strong>: Sharpen Deloitte's data/EX/AI narrative and client showcases.</li>
<li><strong>Low Employee Adoption</strong>: Integrate change management and targeted upskilling in all agentic AI projects.</li>
</ul>

Practitioners must prepare for capability shifts and client expectations shaped by rapid AI service evolution.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;IBM Study Shows CDOs Seek to Align Data Strategies With Outpacing AI Ambitions (Nov 13, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new IBM study released today finds that Chief Data Officers (CDOs) are increasingly challenged to keep data readiness in lockstep with rapidly advancing AI capabilities. As AI becomes more integral to enterprise workflows, CDOs face mounting pressure to resolve issues around data governance, access, and ethical AI oversight. The study notes that a surge in agentic AI—autonomous decision-making systems—has exposed organizational gaps in both data quality and cross-functional alignment, emphasizing the need for a cohesive data strategy underpinning AI initiatives.\\n\\nThe implications for Workday clients and integrators are profound. With Workday increasingly embedding agentic and generative AI within HCM, Finance, and Skills Cloud offerings, customers’ enterprise data foundations—metadata quality, integration, governance—directly influence AI utility and trust. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the takeaway is clear: advisory and implementation services must address not only solution adoption, but also the broader data stewardship, readiness, and compliance frameworks clients need to realize sustained AI value. As AI ambitions outpace traditional IT and governance structures, practices will need to address these alignment gaps to ensure successful adoption and trustworthy outcomes.\\n\\nSee the full study for detailed findings and organizational strategies: https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-13-IBM-Study-Chief-Data-Officers-Redefine-Strategies-as-AI-Ambitions-Outpace-Readiness\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-11-13-IBM-Study-Chief-Data-Officers-Redefine-Strategies-as-AI-Ambitions-Outpace-Readiness\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;People-First AI Demonstrated to Amplify Cultural Change and Results (Nov 12, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Reporting from SiliconANGLE’s November 12th article highlights substantial evidence that a people-first, agentic AI implementation—centered on augmenting rather than replacing human expertise—delivers outsized benefits for both productivity and organizational culture. Unlike pure automation approaches, agentic AI that empowers and learns from employees encourages more innovation and engagement, which in turn enhances the adoption of new digital practices, especially evident within professional services and SaaS platforms such as Workday. The article showcases industry examples where the employee experience (EX) is fundamentally transformed by agent-based recommendations, nudges, and intelligent automation that closes routine gaps and amplifies high-value judgment work.\\n\\nWorkday’s ongoing investments in responsible, explainable AI and user empowerment are strongly validated by these findings. For Deloitte’s practice, this underscores the client advisory need to frame AI adoption as a cultural—and not merely technological—transformation. Practitioner upskilling and change management become central outcomes, and success is measured by both efficiency and experience metrics. The competitive differentiation for Workday implementers hinges on balancing technical delivery with EX-focused enablement, as clients seek trusted partners to navigate the human implications of advanced AI agents.\\n\\nFull coverage available at: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/12/people-first-ai-transforms-culture-results-refresh2025\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/12/people-first-ai-transforms-culture-results-refresh2025\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant Named Major Player in 2025 IDC MarketScape for Canadian AI Services (Nov 12, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IDC’s latest MarketScape positioned Cognizant as a major player in Canadian AI services, emphasizing Cognizant’s breadth of AI consulting, engineering, and platform services. The analysis points to Cognizant’s investment in domain-specific AI—including HR, finance, and autonomous agent solutions—alongside deep partnerships with Workday, SAP, and Oracle ecosystems. Notably, the report suggests an uptick in cross-platform integration managed services that enable clients to orchestrate agentic AI capabilities across hybrid SaaS landscapes, a direct challenge to other GSIs including Deloitte.\\n\\nFor Workday’s customer and partner communities, this ranking affirms growing GSI competition to deliver advisory and build-operate-transfer services for agentic AI in HCM and Finance. Deloitte teams, especially in Canada, must reinforce both their Workday-specific expertise and unique capabilities in governance, responsible AI, and talent change management to sustain leadership. As clients seek to compare offerings across GSIs, differentiators will rest on outcome accountability—measured by tangible improvement in skilled talent, risk mitigation, and platform adoption velocity.\\n\\nSee full IDC recognition details: https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Elevated to IDC MarketScape Major Player for Canadian AI services.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Cognizant’s recognized strength in AI enables them to compete for large Workday and multi-SaaS digital transformation projects across Canada and North America. Their ability to integrate agentic AI solutions across platforms puts pressure on Deloitte’s Workday practice to consolidate its value proposition around governance, talent change, and measurable AI outcomes, not just technical delivery. The win accelerates GSI-level competition for agentic AI thought leadership and managed service opportunities.\\n\\n(https://news.cognizant.com/2025-11-12-Cognizant-Named-a-Major-Player-in-2025-IDC-MarketScape-for-Canadian-AI-Services)\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;IBM\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Shares new research on the gap between enterprise AI ambitions and data readiness.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;IBM’s study reinforces an industry challenge: even as SaaS HR platforms like Workday roll out advanced AI capabilities, client organizations’ data stewardship, governance, and integration maturity often lag.
