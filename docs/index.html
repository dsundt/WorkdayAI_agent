<ul>
  <li><strong>Agentic AI emerging as a true enterprise game-changer</strong> (Published: 2025-10-27)<br><p>A <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510270900BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251027_BW473075-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times briefing</a> emphasizes agentic AI's move from concept to production in HR and workflow tech, including with Workday and competitors. The report outlines how agentic AI drives improvements in cycle times, compliance, and engagement, but also creates new governance and integration needs. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this necessitates readiness in agentic deployment and robust risk frameworks to support client demand for AI-enabled value.</p></li>
  <li><strong>AI boosts productivity by a full workday per week, signals market-wide impact</strong> (Published: 2025-10-28)<br><p>Research highlighted on <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510280300PR_NEWS_EURO_ND__EN07768-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FT Markets</a> reports AI-conferred productivity equivalent to a saved workday per week in HR and back-office, citing platforms like Workday Skills Cloud. Clients will expect entire cycles of improvement, not pilots—raising expectations for Deloitte’s measurable delivery and change management in Workday AI projects.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI governance: Workday’s framework and analyst perspectives</strong> (Published: 2025-10-28)<br><p><a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s AI governance stance</a> is newly detailed, including transparency and bias mitigation. Analyst validation alongside consultant input points to risk and compliance as central differentiators in SaaS selection. Deloitte must cultivate governance depth and auditing muscle as clients increasingly weigh trust and explainability in HR tech investments.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>: Ongoing expansion of agentic AI-driven HR solutions (see <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/community/now-assist-articles/ai-agents-implementation-guides-now-available-on-now-create/ta-p/3205458" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceNow AI agent guides</a>). Implication: Faster rollouts and comprehensive enablement shift client expectations and implementation pace, challenging Workday and Deloitte practices to keep up with or surpass ServiceNow’s quality and self-service approach.</li>
  <li><strong>SAP</strong>: Advancing AI within SuccessFactors HCM, putting emphasis on predictive analytics and advanced employee lifecycle management (<a href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/explore-sap-successfactors-solutions/leveraging-ai-capabilities-in-sap-successfactors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP AI capabilities</a>). Implication: Competitive arms race for embedded HCM AI means Deloitte must double down on cross-platform skills and inform clients on trade-offs across vendor ecosystems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deploying and governing agentic AI for HR automation</strong>: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Agents for HR: Top Use Cases and Examples</a>. Outcome in 90 days: Define and implement two end-to-end agentic HR AI scenarios, fully compliant.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI governance for enterprise SaaS</strong>: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Governance at Workday</a>. Outcome in 90 days: Embed AI governance reviews in every Workday AI deployment and demo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritize agentic AI enablement and governance through internal workshops and leveraging up-to-date vendor/competitor guides.</li>
  <li>Set outcome and productivity benchmarks for all ongoing and new Workday AI client projects.</li>
  <li>Offer AI governance health-check sessions to clients with high regulatory or risk exposure.</li>
  <li>Develop and share a Deloitte position paper on the AI HCM competitive landscape.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Delivery pacing lags client expectations for AI-enabled results.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Intensive practitioner enablement and rapid import of vendor/competitor best practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Exposure to AI risk/regulation, especially around bias and explainability.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Apply rigorous AI governance documentation and auditing to every project, with standardized escalation on risk events.</li>
</ul>

Recent industry analysis and vendor announcements push the importance of AI/ML upskilling, cross-platform enablement, and responsible AI governance for both clients and system integrators.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agentic AI emerging as a true enterprise game-changer (Published: 2025-10-27)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new briefing from the Financial Times underscores the explosive momentum of agentic AI, which describes autonomous, task-oriented AI embedded within platforms like Workday and its competitors. The report stresses that agentic AI is rapidly moving from proof of concept to scalable production deployments in areas like HR, finance, employee service, and workflow optimization. This evolution is jointly driven by SaaS vendors and the integrator ecosystem, as organizations demand measurable improvements in both speed and quality of work. \\n\\nThe report contends that organizations deploying agentic AI see tangible returns, including reduced HR cycle times, improved compliance tracking, and significant upticks in employee engagement. However, the shift comes with expectations for resilience, explainability, and cross-system orchestration—key priorities for clients and solution providers like Deloitte. The story’s broader takeaway is clear: system integrators and HR IT leaders who invest in rapid upskilling and robust integration of agentic models will hold strategic advantage in coming quarters. For Deloitte&#x27;s Workday practice, mastering the deployment and governance of agentic AI scenarios—such as autonomous interview scheduling, onboarding, or adaptive learning—will be critical to driving business value and client trust.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510270900BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251027_BW473075-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI boosts productivity by a full workday per week, signals market-wide impact (Published: 2025-10-28)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A market research headline finds that AI adoption in HR, including platforms like Workday Skills Cloud and AI agent-based automations, is driving productivity gains equivalent to saving one workday per week per employee in enterprise settings. The analysis, while broad, specifically highlights the impact in transaction-heavy back-office areas, as well as in employee self-service and upskilling tools.\\n\\nThis claim draws attention to metrics increasingly cited by both Workday and its competitors—that effective AI yields measurable outcomes for both efficiency and employee experience. For Deloitte&#x27;s Workday teams, this means that clients will expect not just pilots but at-scale outcomes from AI deployments, raising the bar for implementation quality and continuous improvement services. Ensuring enablement for new-use-case design, change management and auditability will be central in upcoming client conversations.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510280300PR_NEWS_EURO_ND__EN07768-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Responsible AI governance: Workday’s framework and analyst perspectives (Published: 2025-10-28)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;New and recent posts from Workday detail their approach to responsible AI governance—including transparency in model development, bias mitigation, and stakeholder engagement. The framework is validated through collaboration with both analysts (e.g., Forrester, which recently highlighted improvements in responsibility metrics for SaaS HR AI) and consulting partners. The implication for HR technology buyers is that AI adoption decisions are now weighted as much by risk governance as by feature depth. \\n\\nFor Deloitte and other SI partners, the need for deep expertise in frameworks, documentation, auditing tools, and AI lifecycle management is intensifying as risk, compliance and external regulatory scrutiny become routine elements of enterprise HR tech transformation. Deloitte’s own investment in agentic-AI assurance capabilities will factor heavily into client selection criteria. Successful practices will offer not only rapid agent deployment but also transparent model monitoring and issue resolution at scale.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Ongoing expansion of agentic AI-driven HR solutions, including deployment guidance and FAQ for AI agents integrated within ServiceNow&#x27;s HRSD suite.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow is accelerating maturity in AI agent rollouts, publishing implementation guides and quick-start resources to simplify adoption. This directly challenges Workday and partners to match both the pace of enablement and the quality of self-service tools. The pressure is on system integrators (like Deloitte) to develop comparable on-demand guidance, reduction in client onboarding cycles, and best-practices frameworks for AI agent governance—especially where clients may deploy multi-suite HR platforms. ServiceNow’s clarity on implementation may shift client expectations for all HCM vendors regarding autonomy, integration options, and responsible deployment support.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Advancing AI within SuccessFactors HCM, emphasizing transformative employee lifecycle management and predictive analytics.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s recent enhancements to SuccessFactors underscore its push toward a more predictive, generative, and adaptive HR suite. SAP is presenting AI as not only embedded but as a differentiating lever for workforce engagement and organizational effectiveness, closely echoing Workday’s positioning. Deloitte and other GSIs need to remain vigilant and up-to-date on cross-platform AI best practices, considering many client environments now include both SAP and Workday components.
