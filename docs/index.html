<ul>
  <li><strong>No significant updates from Workday or key competitors in the last 24 hours</strong><br>
    <p>A review of Workday and ecosystem vendor news (2025-12-03T06:39 to 2025-12-04T06:39 ET) revealed no new product launches, regulatory actions, or strategic leadership commentary. Despite ongoing releases from AWS and Microsoft, there have been no moves substantially impacting Workday's agentic AI, HCM, Extend, or governance positioning. This indicates a short-term period of stability for the Workday ecosystem, allowing Deloitte teams to focus on ongoing learning and enablement rather than emergency analysis. For client advisory, it means existing product guidance and competitive positioning remain current and actionable. <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Workday Newsroom (2025-12-04)</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS</strong>: No disruptive HCM or agentic AI announcements in the past 24 hours. <br>
    <p>Clients can continue with existing Workday-AWS integrations without urgent adjustment. Ongoing AWS ecosystem monitoring is recommended for any late-breaking innovations. Deloitte teams should remain aware but not shift priorities.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: No Copilot or AI agent exclusivity moves directly affecting Workday in the daily window.<br>
    <p>The most recent Workday-Microsoft collaborations retain strategic importance. Consolidate knowledge on these partnerships rather than prepare for fresh competitive disruptions.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dayforce (Ceridian)</strong>: No active launches relevant to Workday found—competitive stance unchanged.<br>
    <p>No immediate escalation required; focus on broader trends in AI productivity tools.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Skill: Responsible AI governance for Workday AI/ML – <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource: Workday AI Governance Blog</a><br>90-day outcome: Build client trust through clear advisory on transparency and compliance.</li>
  <li>Skill: Integration of autonomous agents in HCM workflows – <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource: AI Agents from Workday</a><br>90-day outcome: Deliver actionable demos and advisory to clients on leveraging Workday’s agentic automation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue daily monitoring of Workday, AWS, Microsoft, and ecosystem news feeds for any late-breaking product or regulatory developments.</li>
  <li>Schedule client enablement sessions using up-to-date resources on AI agents and responsible governance within Workday.</li>
  <li>Only update competitive positioning materials if news emerges; maintain focus on advisory and risk management capabilities.</li>
  <li>Encourage proactive readiness in client discussions, highlighting that substantive change can occur between news cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unanticipated competitor announcements just outside the monitoring window. <br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Continue near-instantaneous news monitoring and maintain readiness for rapid response updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Complacency due to perceived stability.<br><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Reinforce proactive, not reactive, client communications about the dynamic nature of AI and cloud HCM market risk.</li>
</ul>

This period includes key vendor releases from AWS re:Invent and the Microsoft ecosystem, but none impacted core Workday HCM, Extend, Skills Cloud, or responsible AI positioning. That absence is meaningful in a fast-evolving market, signalling temporary stability in product and governance dimensions. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this suggests a focus on consolidating recent product learning, client enablement, and risk watching, rather than urgent response or retraining. Staying vigilant for late-breaking updates—as seen post re:Invent in adjacent AI platforms—is essential, but as of this daily window, there is no strategic or technical disruption impacting Workday practitioners or clients. Clients should be advised that the current Workday roadmap and competitive analyses remain valid without change as of today.

[...] At its Workday Rising event in September, the company rolled out Illuminate, its next-gen agentic AI platform, along with four AI agents: Recruiter, Expenses, Succession, and Optimize. Recruiter is for sourcing candidates, recommending talent, and automating outreach and interview scheduling. Expenses creates, submits, and approves expense reports. Succession automates the succession planning process, prompting managers to create succession plans. It also recommends successors, and generates [...] ## Role with it\n\nWorkday has adopted an agentic AI strategy around what it dubs role-based AI agents. Most AI agents in the market today are task-based and follow specific step-by-step instructions. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach believes task-based agents must evolve into role-based agents, which contain a configurable set of skills that give them more autonomy and the ability to better support humans in particular roles.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At its Workday Rising event, the cloud-based HR and financial management company unveiled Illuminate, its next-generation AI platform, as well as four new AI agents and a Workday Assistant for HR and financial processes. It’s all part of what the company is calling a “robust three year AI roadmap.”\n\n“A lot of top HR and ERP vendors are all in the race of producing AI agents,” said Akshara Naik Lopez, senior analyst with Forrester. “Workday is no different.” [...] Integrated into this platform are four new AI agents: Recruiter, Expenses, Succession, and Optimize. Recruiter helps source candidates, recommend talent, and automate outreach and interview scheduling, according to Workday. It can also provide insights into candidate profiles. The company reported that customers are already seeing a 25% increase in recruiter capacity. [...] Assistants, advisors, and agents are reducing business processing time, automating more manual and semi-manual workloads within applications and across them, and bringing more autonomous workflows into the business, North Rizza explained. This allows employees to focus on managing their portion of the business, working on client requirements, and managing customer, supplier, and partner relationships.&quot;,

[...] Workday also announced a fleet of its own new AI agents that are focused on areas including payroll, contracts, and financial auditing, among others. The company previously released four agents in September that targeted areas including recruitment and talent mobility. [...] Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on a press briefing that as AI agents become an increasing part of an enterprise company’s workflow, companies should have a way to manage them just like people. “The workforce is expanding,” Eschenbach said. “It’s no longer just human workers, it’s now digital workers, and we need to have a unified platform that manages your entire workforce going forward.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### How work will evolve along AI\n\nAs AI becomes embedded into daily technical work, organizations are rethinking what it means to be a developer, designer, or engineer. Instead of automating roles end to end, companies are increasingly building AI agents that act as teammates, supporting workers across the entire software development lifecycle. [...] These aren’t just prebuilt tools — teams can create and publish their own agents into an internal marketplace. That has sparked a systematic effort to map every task across traditional tech roles and build agents to enhance them. [...] \&quot;This future where employees have agents working alongside them, taking care of some of these repetitive activities, focusing on higher-value strategic work where human skills are innately important, I think becomes right at the heart of that,” he explained. “You have to unleash the organization to be able to think and rethink in that way.\&quot;\n\nA lot of that depends on the mindset of company leaders, Ahuja said.&quot;,

[...] Google, which has already shipped many AI tools through its Workspace apps, has made Google Workspace Studio generally available to give more employees access to design, manage and share AI agents, further democratizing agentic workflows.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The platform brings together process data spanning systems and departments, enriched with business context that powers AI agents to transform operations effectively,” says Daniel Brown, Chief Product Officer at Celonis.\n\nWith this cross-system awareness, Celonis coordinates actions across complex workflows involving AI agents, humans, and automations — especially critical when tariffs force rapid decisions about suppliers, shipments, and customers. [...] That visibility gap costs the average company double-digit millions in working capital and competitive positioning. As 54% of supply chain leaders face disruptions daily, the pressure is shifting to AI agents that execute real actions: triggering purchase orders, rerouting shipments, adjusting inventory. But an autonomous agent acting on stale or siloed data can make million-dollar mistakes when tariff structures shift overnight. [...] This distinction becomes critical when deploying autonomous agents. When visibility is fragmented, autonomous agents can easily make decisions that appear rational locally but create downstream disruption. With real-time context, AI can operate with clarity and precision, and supply chains can stay ahead of tariff-driven disruption.\n\n### Digital Twins: Powering real-time response&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A Smarter Way to Predict Profit Starts With HR Data Analytics&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Improved budgeting accuracy: By detecting small shifts in workforce behavior early, AI gives HR and finance teams more time to adjust headcount plans, training investments and labor budgets. [...] Fewer reporting mistakes: AI reduces manual entry and reconciliation work, helping eliminate the small but costly inaccuracies that distort forecasts.\n Faster scenario modeling: Leaders can test questions like, \&quot;What if attrition rises 35%?\&quot; or \&quot;How would a slowdown in hiring velocity affect project capacity?\&quot; without days of analysis. [...] Forecasting through people data transforms traditional HR metrics into true leading indicators of business performance. When leaders understand how shifts in engagement, turnover, skills and hiring velocity shape operational capacity and financial outcomes, they gain a clearer view of what&#x27;s coming next.\n\nWith an integrated perspective across workforce, payroll and financial data, ADP empowers leaders to make smarter, more confident forecasting decisions.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI and advanced analytics are powering new science and accelerating medical discovery. But their broader value lies in helping organizations communicate with empathy at scale. When used responsibly, AI can personalize education for patients managing chronic conditions, anticipate outreach needs for caregivers, or deliver clinical updates tailored to a physician’s specialty. [...] 1. Modernize the content supply chain. Integrate data platforms, creative workflows, and measurement tools to deliver consistent, context-aware content across channels.\n2. Embed AI responsibly. Use AI to augment—not replace—human expertise, enabling transparency and trust in each interaction.\n3. Design for simplicity. Whether serving a clinician, patient, or caregiver, reduce friction by aligning digital experiences to real-world workflows. [...] For engagement leaders, the imperative is clear: don’t add to the noise. Streamline experiences for healthcare professionals by providing the right information, in the right format, at the right time. For patients, confirm digital touchpoints simplify—not complicate—the path to care.\n\nBy integrating AI insights and digital experience design, organizations can deliver support that fits naturally into both provider workflows and patient journeys.\n\n## Data and AI as enablers of empathy&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;1. Modernize the content supply chain. Integrate data platforms, creative workflows, and measurement tools to deliver consistent, context-aware content across channels.\n2. Embed AI responsibly. Use AI to augment—not replace—human expertise, enabling transparency and trust in each interaction.\n3. Design for simplicity. Whether serving a clinician, patient, or caregiver, reduce friction by aligning digital experiences to real-world workflows. [...] AI and advanced analytics are powering new science and accelerating medical discovery. But their broader value lies in helping organizations communicate with empathy at scale. When used responsibly, AI can personalize education for patients managing chronic conditions, anticipate outreach needs for caregivers, or deliver clinical updates tailored to a physician’s specialty. [...] For engagement leaders, the imperative is clear: don’t add to the noise. Streamline experiences for healthcare professionals by providing the right information, in the right format, at the right time. For patients, confirm digital touchpoints simplify—not complicate—the path to care.\n\nBy integrating AI insights and digital experience design, organizations can deliver support that fits naturally into both provider workflows and patient journeys.\n\n## Data and AI as enablers of empathy&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Dual Reality of Agentic AI in the Enterprise&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;One of the predictions envisions a near future where CEOs use agentic AI not for operational efficiency, but for strategic insight. These systems may model mergers, simulate supply chain disruptions, and forecast policy impacts faster than human teams can aggregate the data.\n\nTo make that shift, enterprises will need to embed three design principles at the core of their AI programs: [...] As enterprises move from predictive and generative to agentic AI, the stakes are changing. Agentic AI — software systems capable of reasoning, acting, and learning autonomously — may sit at the center of critical business operations. For some, this evolution will surface new vulnerabilities. For others, it will create an entirely new source of strategic advantage.\n\nIn IDC’s FutureScape: Worldwide Agentic Artificial Intelligence 2026 Predictions, two forecasts capture this divergence clearly. [...] 1. Traceability by design. Every autonomous decision should carry a data lineage record and confidence score, allowing oversight without throttling performance.\n2. Integrated governance. AI ethics, risk, and compliance functions should be unified and integrated, and applied across the development and operations lifecycle.\n3. Accountability loops. Decision thresholds or hard-coded events trigger human interventions before outcomes cross defined boundaries.&quot;,

To support this model, new roles such as conversational AI and agent designers,AI performance specialists, and AI process engineerswill emerge, ensuring that human-AI collaboration is efficient and value-driven. [...] Organizations can provide this support by having the AI agents shadow human experts and extract tacit knowledge from direct customer discussions, playing this into the overall knowledge pool and AI-supported unstructured data mining.

By making model customization more accessible, enterprises will be able to develop more efficient, customized AI agents that [...] It’s an important capability, AWS said, because when companies create AI agents to automate business tasks, they generally want to base them on the most advanced large language models available. But these models generally have extraordinarily high inference demands, especially when they’re being asked to power AI agents that have to reason through problems and employ third-party tools. That results in agents using massive amounts of processing power, even for simple, routine tasks such as [...] A similar update is coming to Amazon SageMaker AI, which is a more advanced AI machine learning platform that allows companies to design, develop and deploy their own models and customize them.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI changes the game. Bespoke AI agents coordinated through an orchestration layer deliver end-to-end visibility and scalable automation across workflows: ingest and classify data, validate exemptions, enrich invoices, and detect anomalies, with a parallel reconciliation stream for compliance checks. The orchestration layer coordinates AI agents to automate steps and support compliance.

Some moves to consider: [...] AI changes the nature of SALT work. Teams can move away from production-heavy tasks toward higher-value activities such as issue screening, policy interpretation, strategic advisory, and stewardship. This shift requires teams to retool and learn new capabilities, because AI augments work and cannot replace human judgment, which remains essential for interpretation and governance. Upskilling is central: building fluency, governance literacy, and practical AI skills needed to experiment, iterate,&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A Smarter Way to Predict Profit Starts With HR Data Analytics&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Improved budgeting accuracy: By detecting small shifts in workforce behavior early, AI gives HR and finance teams more time to adjust headcount plans, training investments and labor budgets. [...] ## AI as the accelerator\n\nHigh-quality people data creates early visibility, but responsible AI turns that visibility into sharper, faster and more reliable forecasting. Instead of manually stitching together spreadsheets, leaders can use AI to reduce reporting errors, uncover patterns earlier and model scenarios in seconds.\n\nThe benefits are practical and immediate: [...] Leaders are boosting traditional financial forecasts by using workforce data as an early indicator of business performance. Combined with AI, HR insights on engagement, turnover and skills help spot trends sooner, enabling faster, more accurate decisions and better margin management.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is the rise of agentic commerce: AI agents acting on behalf of users to discover, recommend, and eventually transact. It’s reshaping the travel industry’s front door, and companies need to act quickly to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n## The disappearing search bar and a new route to discovery [...] The promise of agent ecosystems is seamless cooperation. As brands deploy their own assistants, travelers are likely to use third-party AI agents to plan and book travel plans. The question is how to make your brand’s agent ready to collaborate with others without losing control of experience, economics, or trust. [...] Steps to consider:\n\n Design the experience. Map how travelers interact across search, plan, book, and manage, then shape your site’s flow, brand voice, and interface to match. Add clear confirmations, smart defaults, and guardrails for things like accuracy, change fees, and fare rules.\n\n Make real-time data accessible. Expose real-time availability, pricing, ancillaries, loyalty profiles and balances, and payments via secure, permissioned APIs that an AI agent can discover.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The surprising places agentic AI is cutting the wait - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The biggest lift I saw came from HR. Application backlogs caused candidates to drop off. Interview scheduling created friction across time zones. Compensation exceptions slowed approvals. Agentic AI addressed all three. Conversational agents guide candidates through application steps. Scheduling agents reconciled calendars, set up interviews and sent confirmations. Qualification agents screened resumes against policy. Sentiment agents summarized tone and engagement from written and verbal [...] Organizations that have leaned into this approach have reported dramatic improvements in self-submitted HR requests, faster employee onboarding and higher satisfaction due to real-time knowledge enrichment. This reinforces a simple truth: removing friction creates participation.\n\n## Workflow orchestration reduces cross-function friction [...] I also deployed agents that assisted human analysts. They summarized lengthy ticket histories, suggested relevant knowledge articles and drafted follow-up communication. They even generated new content as knowledge articles from closed incidents to expand self-service coverage. This type of coexistence shifted work away from repetition and toward judgment.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The future of agentic commerce for hospitality and leisure&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is the rise of agentic commerce: AI agents acting on behalf of users to discover, recommend, and eventually transact. It’s reshaping the travel industry’s front door, and companies need to act quickly to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n## The disappearing search bar and a new route to discovery [...] The promise of agent ecosystems is seamless cooperation. As brands deploy their own assistants, travelers are likely to use third-party AI agents to plan and book travel plans. The question is how to make your brand’s agent ready to collaborate with others without losing control of experience, economics, or trust. [...] Steps to consider:\n\n Design the experience. Map how travelers interact across search, plan, book, and manage, then shape your site’s flow, brand voice, and interface to match. Add clear confirmations, smart defaults, and guardrails for things like accuracy, change fees, and fare rules.\n\n Make real-time data accessible. Expose real-time availability, pricing, ancillaries, loyalty profiles and balances, and payments via secure, permissioned APIs that an AI agent can discover.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale. [...] As noted at the beginning of this chapter, employees anticipate AI will have a dramatic impact on their work. Now they would like their companies to invest in the training that will help them succeed. Nearly half of employees in our survey say they want more formal training and believe it is the best way to boost AI adoption. They also would like access to AI tools in the form of betas or pilots, and they indicate that incentives such as financial rewards and recognition can improve uptake. [...] Many millennials aged 35 to 44 are managers and team leaders in their companies. In our survey, they self-report having the most experience and enthusiasm about AI, making them natural champions of transformational change. Millennials are the most active generation of AI users. Some 62 percent of 35- to 44-year-old employees report high levels of expertise with AI, compared with 50 percent of 18- to 24-year-old Gen Zers and 22 percent of baby boomers over 65 (Exhibit 4).

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Generative AI has become deeply integrated into daily life. People increasingly rely on it to think, create, and make decisions. Yet, as organizations scale their use of generative AI tools, a quiet assumption often goes unquestioned: that an AI tool will respond in the same way regardless of the language used to prompt it, much like changing the language setting of a phone.\n\n Post [...] Read more on Generative AI or related topics Global strategy, AI and machine learning, Strategy formulation, Risk management and Customer-centricity\n\n## Partner Center [...] SKIP TO CONTENT\n\nGenerative AI|Research: LLMs Respond Differently in English and Chinese\n\nSubscribe\n\nGenerative AI\n\n# Research: LLMs Respond Differently in English and Chinese\n\nby Jackson G.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;On the most fundamental level, a generative AI agent is just an LLM operating in an environment in which its natural language processing (NLP) ability is used to output text that can function as the input to external tools and data sources to which it has been connected. For example, the LLM driving an agent might output a SQL query to extract information from a company database, or a structured JSON object to make an API call that triggers a specific action in an external application.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Chapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. [...] Our research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI [...] Chapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enterprises wanting to automate portions of their business must be judicious when choosing which areas are stable enough to entrust to a team of AI agents. Unpredictable environments might be better left to more adaptive, quick-thinking teams of human workers.\n\n### Communication bottlenecks [...] In an enterprise, C-suite executives focus on large-scale planning, middle managers convert leadership directives into operational tasks and employees handle the brunt of the actual workload. Hierarchical agent systems apply the same structure to AI-powered agentic workflows. [...] High-level agents are responsible for the “big picture,” managing the overall system in alignment with broader goals. Interpreting a user request, forming a plan and dividing that plan into tasks are all high-level agent responsibilities.\n\n### Mid-level agents&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Employees are ready and eager to adopt agentic AI, but organizations are fumbling the fundamentals of strategy, training and communication, according to new research from Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY US). The EY Agentic AI in the Workplace Survey reveals a paradox: while agentic AI optimism is high, confusion and anxiety threaten to stall this transformative period in the future of work. The research also uncovered how generational differences are creating a wide managerial divide on how to lead these [...] The human readiness gap: enthusiasm meets an overwhelmed workforce\n\nAgentic AI is already delivering tangible value, with 86% of employees reporting that working with AI agents has had a positive impact on their team&#x27;s productivity. This proven success breeds confidence across the workforce: a vast majority (90%) of desk workers already using agentic AI are confident in their abilities to use AI agents today. [...] The survey, which polled more than 1,100 desk workers across six industries at companies with $1B+ in revenue in the U.S., found that 84% of employees are eager to embrace agentic AI in their roles, anticipating positive impacts on productivity, efficiency and work experience. Yet, more than half (56%) simultaneously worry about their own job security working alongside AI agents, and 51% worry that agentic AI will make their job obsolete.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Think of a call center or store environment. You generate an agentic customer, and you say, “This is a type of call. This is a type of customer. Record an interaction.” It’s not only simulating a real phone call. You’re also getting live, detailed scoring of how you, as a frontline employee, are doing in that interaction. Are you using the right words? Have you remembered every single step of the process? It gives you very detailed coaching instructions.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Tariff turbulence exposes costly blind spots in supply ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“The platform brings together process data spanning systems and departments, enriched with business context that powers AI agents to transform operations effectively,” says Daniel Brown, Chief Product Officer at Celonis.\n\nWith this cross-system awareness, Celonis coordinates actions across complex workflows involving AI agents, humans, and automations — especially critical when tariffs force rapid decisions about suppliers, shipments, and customers. [...] That visibility gap costs the average company double-digit millions in working capital and competitive positioning. As 54% of supply chain leaders face disruptions daily, the pressure is shifting to AI agents that execute real actions: triggering purchase orders, rerouting shipments, adjusting inventory. But an autonomous agent acting on stale or siloed data can make million-dollar mistakes when tariff structures shift overnight. [...] Enhanced Task Mining extends this by connecting desktop activity — keystrokes, mouse clicks, screen scrolls — to business processes. This exposes manual work invisible to system logs: spreadsheet gymnastics, email negotiations, phone calls that keep supply chains moving during urgent changes.\n\n### Competitive advantage in volatile markets&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values.&quot;,

A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents.

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,

At VentureBeat’s Transform 2025, Matthew Kropp, managing director and senior partner at BCG, offered a game plan for workflow evolution, employee adoption, and organizational change. [...] In a study BCG conducted with Harvard, Wharton, and MIT, they asked 750 knowledge workers to write a business and marketing plan, with and without generative AI. The participants using GPT4 executed 25% faster, completed 15% more tasks, and the quality of their output was 40% better. And when given an LLM, the bottom performers in the baseline did just as well as the top performers. [...] While these tools are fantastic, people aren’t using them. BCG tracked the adoption of GitHub Copilot and productivity metrics for an organization with about 10,000 software engineers.

[...] “HR is at a critical juncture. The function is under pressure to become both more cost efficient and more strategic. That is a challenging balance to strike,” said John Hazan, a partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of the firm’s Talent solution. “Generative AI has the power to elevate HR’s role in the organization, from transactional operators to strategic advisers.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enter generative AI. Paradoxically, the technology can help HR professionals have a more human touch—and at a lower cost than ever before. By enabling drastic efficiency in transactional tasks, it frees up HR professionals to refocus on their expertise and play a more strategic role. In fact, Bain analysis shows that companies can save an average of 15% to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and augmentation. [...] According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer, automating or augmenting select HR tasks can save more time than others.

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,
