<ul>
<li><strong>No substantive product, partnership, or regulatory updates in the Workday ecosystem in the last 24 hours (as of October 22, 2025).</strong><br/>
A comprehensive review of vetted news sources, including Workday's official newsroom and leading industry and analyst sites, reveals no significant announcements since the previous report. This follows a recent flurry of strategic agentic AI developments—however, in the last 24 hours, there were no new launches, strategic shifts, or ecosystem partnerships. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this provides a period of stability to consolidate enablement and planning, but underlines the need to stay ready for imminent developments, especially around AI governance and agent orchestration.<br/>

</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Capgemini:</strong> No major competitive developments were detected in the last 24 hours. As previously reported, these vendors continue investing in agentic AI and digital workforce orchestration but announced no fresh features, partnerships, or pivots in this cycle. <br/>
<strong>Implication:</strong> A continuation of the status quo offers an opportunity for Deloitte and clients to fine-tune preparations or pilot programs without fear of missing out on major new competitive differentiators. However, historic patterns suggest renewed activity could occur at short notice, so vigilance is required.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay Informed on AI Agent Ecosystem Developments:</strong> Continue leveraging authoritative resources (such as <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-02-11-The-Next-Generation-of-Workforce-Management-is-Here-Workday-Unveils-New-Agent-System-of-Record" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday newsroom</a>) to remain ready for rapid shifts in the landscape. In the current environment, knowledge agility is an enduring differentiator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain focused news monitoring for both Workday and HCM competitor ecosystems to spot breaking product or governance announcements.</li>
<li>Host short internal teach-ins summarizing recent agentic AI developments and keep playbooks current.</li>
<li>Advise clients on resilience and flexibility as they prepare for the next wave of innovation, leveraging relative market calm to stress-test roadmaps and integration plans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> A sudden influx of high-impact news after a period of inactivity could disadvantage teams that are not continuously monitoring.<br/>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Keep real-time monitoring protocols in place and brief key stakeholders proactively.
</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Lull in major updates may encourage complacency across consulting and client teams.<br/>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Invest in upskilling, resource development, and proactive client engagement to maintain a leadership position when activity resumes.</li>
</ul>

In the current 24-hour window, no new material affecting strategic direction, technical capabilities, client implementation, or competitive analysis has surfaced.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this means existing enablement, opportunity scouting, and risk posture remain unchanged, and teams can focus on deepening expertise with resources from the preceding week. Maintaining readiness to react swiftly to major news—especially around AI agent orchestration or new governance requirements—continues to be critical.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-02-11-The-Next-Generation-of-Workforce-Management-is-Here-Workday-Unveils-New-Agent-System-of-Record\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Capgemini\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;No significant new moves in the last 24 hours; previously announced initiatives continue to evolve, but no fresh launches or strategic pivots were detected in the review window.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Workday and its advisory partners remain in a holding pattern with regard to disruptive moves from core competitors.

This follows a recent flurry of strategic agentic AI developments—however, in the last 24 hours, there were no new launches, strategic shifts, or ecosystem partnerships. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this provides a period of stability to consolidate enablement and planning, but underlines the need to stay ready for imminent developments, especially around AI governance and agent orchestration.&lt;br/&gt;\\nPublication date: February 11, 2025. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-02-11-The-Next-Generation-of-Workforce-Management-is-Here-Workday-Unveils-New-Agent-System-of-Record\\\&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Capgemini:&lt;/strong&gt; No major competitive developments were detected in the last 24 hours.

The competitive environment remains stable, which benefits current Workday client projects and allows Deloitte to continue refining methodologies and advising on readiness for agent-driven upgrades.

Building this organizational muscle is key over the next 90 days.\\n\\nActions for Next Week\\n- Monitor Workday and competitor news feeds for product, partnership, and regulatory updates.\\n- Run internal knowledge sharing sessions and update playbooks using the most recent major announcements.\\n- Advise clients to use this period of stability to ready digital workforce and agentic AI strategies.\\n\\nRisks &amp; Mitigations\\n- Risk: Major news after a lull could catch teams off guard. Mitigation: Keep round-the-clock news tracking and proactive stakeholder briefs in place.\\n- Risk: Prolonged quiet could cause loss of strategic sharpness.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Rather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work. [...] The role of agentic AI is expanding—and so is the scope of decisions that must be made around it. Leaders must be intentional when shaping that transformation to unlock long-term advantage.\n\nWant to go deeper on how agentic AI is transforming work at scale? Discover how Workday is building enterprise-grade AI agents designed for trust, impact, and action.\n\nElevating Human Potential: The AI Skills Revolution [...] As organizations grapple with rising complexity, constrained resources, and relentless change, AI agents offer something rare: scalable intelligence that acts with purpose. And this evolution is underway across industries; Gartner predicts 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028—up from just 1% in 2024—and at least 15% of business decisions will be made autonomously via agents.&quot;,

Start simple: wrap an API, expose a database query, or simulate a business rule.\n\nIntegrate enterprise data. Connect to SAP HANA, SAP Datasphere, or any source that holds valuable context. [...] At their core, Agentic AI systems treat the model as more than a text generator. The model is empowered to analyze user inputs, determine whether external actions are required (such as calling APIs or querying data), and execute those actions before synthesizing a final response. This enables a more dynamic and interactive experience, especially valuable in real-world use cases that involve external data sources, business logic, or multi-modal interactions. [...] At the core of an agentic AI system is a purposeful composition of AI workflow patterns, tailored to address complex, real-world tasks. In our approach, we implement a custom hybrid orchestration, where the language model (LLM) acts as the central orchestrator interpreting user intent, planning the appropriate sequence of actions, and dynamically delegating tasks to specialized tools. The LLM not only selects the right tools but also provides the necessary parameters, ensuring each component&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\&quot;Our partnership with Workday is a breakthrough in delivering the trust organizations need to adopt AI,\&quot; said Charles Lamanna, president, business and industry Copilot, Microsoft. \&quot;By seamlessly registering agents built with Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry into Workday&#x27;s Agent System of Record, we&#x27;re giving customers full visibility into their AI ecosystem. This integration equips leaders with actionable analytics to measure ROI, enforce governance, and ensure their AI agents are secure and [...] Enhance Human-Agent Collaboration: The new integration between Workday and Microsoft&#x27;s agent systems will allow seamless interoperability between different AI agents.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Foundation model – You choose a foundation model (FM) that the agent invokes to interpret user input and subsequent prompts in its orchestration process. The agent also invokes the FM to generate responses and follow-up steps in its process.\n Instructions – You write instructions that describe what the agent is designed to do. With advanced prompts, you can further customize instructions for the agent at every step of orchestration and include Lambda functions to parse each step&#x27;s output. [...] + Action groups – You define the actions that the agent should perform for the user (through providing the following resources):\n\n    - One of the following schemas to define the parameters that the agent needs to elicit from the user (each action group can use a different schema): [...] 1. The agent interprets the input with a foundation model and generates a rationale that lays out the logic for the next step it should take.\n   2. The agent predicts which action in an action group it should invoke or which knowledge base it should query.&quot;,

[...] Government agencies and worker advocates have expressed concerns that AI tools can discriminate against job applicants when they are built using data that reflects existing biases.\n\nThe EEOC has warned employers that they can be held legally liable if they fail to prevent screening software from having a discriminatory impact.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI bias can stem from flawed data, algorithmic design and human judgment, leading to outcomes that may perpetuate societal inequalities.\n Mitigating AI bias requires a human-centric approach: conducting data audits, re-evaluating algorithms and grounding decisions in societal contexts.\n Long-term solutions include continuous monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and aligning AI outcomes with ethical principles and societal wellbeing. [...] Bias in AI systems poses serious challenges that can lead to unfair treatment and systemic discrimination. To combat these issues, organizations must implement strategies like data audits and algorithm testing, while fostering collaboration and public awareness. Recognizing the implications for individuals and society, identifying types of bias, and developing strategies for monitoring and mitigating bias are essential for creating fairer and more responsible AI systems.\n\nAbout this article [...] Bias in AI systems refers to systematic and unfair discrimination that arises from the design, development and deployment of AI technologies. It can manifest in various forms, including algorithmic bias, data bias and human bias, leading to outcomes that disproportionately affect certain groups of people based on characteristics such as race, gender, age or socioeconomic status.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI fear might not be the only reason tech talent is holding ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Market and economic uncertainty -- more so than AI -- are holding back job hunts, said Phil Willburn, vice president of people analytics, insights, and experiences at Workday. \&quot;This is especially true in the technology sector, where the story is one of significant internal career stagnation -- not stability.\&quot; [...] Workday&#x27;s own data showed that \&quot;while hiring demand in tech remains one of the highest among industries -- with new job requisition volume growing 29% year-over-year -- the market itself is slow and hyper-competitive,\&quot; Willburn noted. More than half of open roles (57%) take over 30 days to fill, and each job offer in this sector attracts an average of 40 applications. \&quot;This challenging process means that even if employees want to leave, they struggle to find a new role.\&quot; [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s a cacophony of unstable environments -- tariffs, AI, geopolitics -- that are making people stay, make do, or lock in -- all for the wrong reasons,\&quot; said Caroline Stokes, workplace author and coach. \&quot;Until recently, people wanted to move on from their organization because their managers weren&#x27;t decisive, driven, innovative, ethical, or respectful, combined with a lack of investment in the areas the business needed to move into -- AI.\&quot;&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Market and economic uncertainty -- more so than AI -- are holding back job hunts, said Phil Willburn, vice president of people analytics, insights, and experiences at Workday. \&quot;This is especially true in the technology sector, where the story is one of significant internal career stagnation -- not stability.\&quot; [...] Workday&#x27;s own data showed that \&quot;while hiring demand in tech remains one of the highest among industries -- with new job requisition volume growing 29% year-over-year -- the market itself is slow and hyper-competitive,\&quot; Willburn noted. More than half of open roles (57%) take over 30 days to fill, and each job offer in this sector attracts an average of 40 applications. \&quot;This challenging process means that even if employees want to leave, they struggle to find a new role.\&quot; [...] \&quot;It&#x27;s a cacophony of unstable environments -- tariffs, AI, geopolitics -- that are making people stay, make do, or lock in -- all for the wrong reasons,\&quot; said Caroline Stokes, workplace author and coach. \&quot;Until recently, people wanted to move on from their organization because their managers weren&#x27;t decisive, driven, innovative, ethical, or respectful, combined with a lack of investment in the areas the business needed to move into -- AI.\&quot;&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The age of agentic AI is here. Autonomous systems do more than follow instructions; they make decisions, act and accelerate innovation at machine speed. From automating financial transactions to managing cybersecurity workflows, these digital teammates transform operations across sales, finance, HR, IT and security. Agentic AI acts as an amplifier of our efforts, allowing us to be more productive. [...] With these 4 best practices, organizations can confidently adopt agentic AI while maintaining security, compliance and operational resilience. And IBM Verify Identity Protection is the right tool to help organizations make these best practices a reality.\n\n## IBM Verify Identity Protection balances innovation with security [...] IBM Verify Identity Protection delivers identity observability and AI-driven threat detection that is purpose-built for modern hybrid enterprises. With VIP, security teams gain:\n\nAgentic AI offers transformative potential by automating workflows, accelerating decisions and unlocking enterprise efficiency. But without proper controls, it also introduces unmanaged identities, shadow access, and elevated breach risks.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Successful AI adoption needs workers in the loop&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Some jobs will be affected more than others. While routine tasks will be the first to be automated, skilled or knowledgeable workers could lose out too. A report from the National Bureau of Economic Research in Massachusetts, which looked at customer service, said agentic AI assistance could lift the performance of a novice worker above that of colleagues with greater knowledge and more experience. [...] Another use is in making sure that staff are given work to match their skills, which Meier calls “just-right tasks”. An employee’s profile can then be updated and tasks assigned to prevent them becoming bored. For sizeable teams, AI is better equipped than a human manager to collate such information.\n\nWhichever tasks companies believe AI will manage, hollowing out a workforce in anticipation of change is not advised. [...] Each business should empower its workers to suggest where the technology is best adopted. Many staff already use AI and it is better to involve them than to have no control over how the technology is used. Once a strategy is determined and a pilot scheme has been successful, workers should be educated about the business case.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Make ‘agent manager’ a core workforce skill\n\nAI changes jobs more than it eliminates them. The key skill now is managing agents: directing their work, checking their output and improving their instructions. [...] Our research shows workers are cautiously optimistic — 52% think AI will help their work, but 29% worry it might replace them. CIOs have a critical role to play in helping employees see AI as a teammate, not a threat — through guidance, training and clear examples of where it adds value.\n\nA practical approach:\n\nThis approach doesn’t just drive adoption — it builds resilience in a mixed human-AI workforce where employees see themselves as partners with agents, not competitors. [...] Agentic AI is about to change how companies create value. Morgan Stanley estimates AI could add $13 to $16 trillion in value to the S&amp;P 500, with nearly $500 billion estimated coming from agentic AI alone. Yet, most enterprises aren’t ready. According to new research from Asana’s Work Innovation Lab, only 20% of organizations have successfully scaled AI agents, while nearly a third don’t even have a plan. Workers, meanwhile, already expect to delegate 43% of their workload to AI agents within&quot;,

AI agents work with human talent to unlock new productivity and accelerate time to care. They proactively encourage patients to schedule a visit, pick up their prescription sooner, or come in for preventative screenings.\n\n## New from Agentforce Health\n\n## Reduce burnout and deliver personalized services for patients, members, and constituents. [...] When AI agents are on a connected health platform, they can extend even more value to your teams, giving them more time to spend on the parts of healthcare that truly require the human touch.\n\nIn the agentic enterprise, humans and AI agents work together to achieve outcomes more effectively and efficiently. This may include agents:\n\n## The agentic platform designed for healthcare [...] ## 5. Create an agentic enterprise for healthcare by connecting digital labor and humans\n\nAgentic AI is different from any other AI that’s come before it. It can reason and converse. Patients can talk to it in natural language. Yet, the power of agents is not in erasing the need for humans, but augmenting our capabilities.&quot;,

AI agents are collapsing the gap between insight and action.\n\n## Share article [...] Consider a company launching a product line. In the past, Finance would crunch sales forecasts, Operations would keep tabs on the supply chain, Marketing would track adoption and sentiment, and Service would collect customer feedback. Weeks or more might pass before these views aligned. Now, AI agents monitoring a unified data platform can instantly detect unexpected demand, adjust forecasts, reallocate inventory, alert suppliers, and recommend boosting marketing spend, all before competitors [...] Dashboards still have an important place in the enterprise. What’s changing is the next step. A dashboard tells you that conversion rates are dropping. AI agents can run an analysis to tell you why, and what to do about it.\n\nIt’s a faster way to respond, and a faster way to act.\n\n## What’s your agentic AI strategy?\n\nOur playbook is your free guide to becoming an agentic enterprise.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The age of agentic AI is here. Autonomous systems do more than follow instructions; they make decisions, act and accelerate innovation at machine speed. From automating financial transactions to managing cybersecurity workflows, these digital teammates transform operations across sales, finance, HR, IT and security. Agentic AI acts as an amplifier of our efforts, allowing us to be more productive. [...] To stay ahead in this era of autonomous identities and automated tools, enterprises need a new security paradigm built for visibility, control and governance. IBM Verify Identity Protection (VIP) enables organizations to secure agentic AI while maintaining speed, innovation and trust.\n\n## Not all agents are agentic AI: Why definitions matter [...] For security leaders, clarity matters. Consider the difference between agentic AI for security and security for agentic AI:\n\nIt is also important that security leaders understand the differences in the types of AI agents.\n\n## The rapid rise of agentic AI and its security blind spots\n\nAutonomous agents represent a fundamental shift in enterprise IT:\n\nYet this speed of innovation creates critical blind spots, including the following:&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To help organizations move to the Frontier, Microsoft offers a suite of agentic business applications with Dynamics 365—bringing enterprise-grade AI and Microsoft Copilot experiences across CRM, ERP, and CCaaS. Organizations can extend Dynamics 365 with Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft Copilot Studio to build custom AI-powered applications and agents tailored to unique business needs.\n\nAt the core of every agentic business application there are three components: [...] 1. Agents that transform business processes.\n2. Copilot that empowers every employee to maximize productivity.\n3. A unified, secure data platform that connects insights across the enterprise.\n\nLet’s take a look at each of the components of the stack.\n\n## Expanding Dynamics 365 agents in key business functions [...] Business leaders are facing a new reality. AI and agents are transforming traditional systems of record into systems of action, becoming applications that not only store data but use it to drive decisions and outcomes.\n\nIn this new model, the user experience becomes almost invisible. What matters most is the foundation: structured data, clear governance, and business logic that allows agents to operate effectively.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For Scotts’ Fleites, the most critical issue will be how digital leaders identify the talent that excels in this new working environment. Identifying effective AI managers will be hard because most companies only have weeks of experience in agentic use cases rather than years. Fleites says the best strategy is to blend external and internal AI capabilities. [...] So while AI will likely change the nature of work, businesses can’t afford to assume the end is near for IT professionals. As more workplace tasks are automated, digital leaders must keep talented humans in the loop to oversee systems. Fleites says organizations should consider how they skill up a cadre of lower-level professionals to become agent managers. [...] Kenny Scott, data governance consultant at energy specialist EDF Power Solutions, also believes there’ll be a rise in the importance of softer skills at the expense of more traditional capabilities. He suggests the data quality analyst role could decline as agents become more effective when trained on KPIs. Scott’s message is clear: as AI takes hold, talented human experts will remain important, but in different ways.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;To generate bottom-line value from AI, companies must redesign workflows, reshape job architecture and role expectations, upskill their existing workforce, and craft KPIs to gauge real progress—not to mention earn and maintain the trust of their employees. All of these responsibilities sit squarely within the purview of the CPO.\n An AI-first CPO blends technical fluency and a builder’s mindset with empathy to help employees move from anxiety to confidence as AI redefines their work. [...] They’ll also need to earn and maintain the trust of their employees who bring the promise of AI to fruition—people working on the frontlines, in the middle ranks, and deep inside functions that weren’t originally designed with GenAI or AI agents in mind. [...] Is my CPO AI-curious? Nearly three years on from ChatGPT’s global debut, your CPO shouldn’t just be talking about AI—they should be using it. At a minimum, that means launching pilots within HR to understand adoption hurdles firsthand and experimenting with ways to overcome them. The CPO will already have started defining KPIs to measure real value creation, like productivity gains, rather than performative engagement.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI is here. Now, CIOs must orchestrate&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Scale systems, not just tools\n\nThe companies that scale responsibly now won’t just get more efficient — they’ll set the tone for how employees trust and adopt AI over the next decade. For CIOs, this is bigger than deploying technology: it’s shaping the future of work itself.\n\nDo this right and you won’t just modernize your company. You’ll show what intelligent, resilient, human-centered organizations look like in the age of AI agents. [...] So how do we get there? Our research shows the gap comes down to structure. In organizations that provide formal training, nearly 80% of employees feel confident using AI, compared to just 40% where training is absent. And governance matters just as much: Only 19% of workers say their company has clear rules for when to rely on AI versus people. The takeaway is to treat AI like infrastructure, not one-off experiments.\n\nWhat CIOs should do:\n\n## You can’t automate chaos. Redesign workflows first [...] Our research shows workers are cautiously optimistic — 52% think AI will help their work, but 29% worry it might replace them. CIOs have a critical role to play in helping employees see AI as a teammate, not a threat — through guidance, training and clear examples of where it adds value.\n\nA practical approach:\n\nThis approach doesn’t just drive adoption — it builds resilience in a mixed human-AI workforce where employees see themselves as partners with agents, not competitors.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Learn how Vertesia enables secure, scalable deployment of AI agents across the entire organization (from finance and HR to marketing and customer service) without compromising governance, observability, or customization. Jonny delivers a full demo of the platform in action, showing a use case in which a finance persona can analyze contract data, estimate cash flow, and generate robust Excel outputs in seconds using autonomous AI agents.   \n  \nKey takeaways: [...] Our AI assistant is for everyone — from sales and marketing to customer service, HR, and finance. That said, it&#x27;s really the IT team that manages the underlying platform. And that matters because senior IT leadership needs a scalable way to deploy AI agents safely and transparently.\n\nKeith: What kind of problems would a company be facing that your platform is designed to solve? What&#x27;s the main value here? [...] Today, we&#x27;re going to show you Vertesia. It&#x27;s a platform to build, deploy, and scale generative AI and AI agents. More specifically, we&#x27;re going to be showing you our new enterprise AI assistant.\n\nWhat that does is put AI agents in the hands of every employee — while providing security, governance, and observability for CIOs.&quot;,

Individualized AI-driven learning and development programs also help employees grow in their careers, leading to greater job satisfaction. When HR managers spend less time performing time-consuming repetitive tasks, they’re free to focus on relationship-building along with more creative strategic initiatives. [...] ### Improved, highly specific decision-making\n\nHR departments receive massive amounts of highly specific information about prospects, employees and performance—along with third-party data like compliance requirements. Whether analyzing resumes or providing HR professionals with performance insights, agentic AI can help ingest metrics and data points and help organizations make informed decisions about hiring, promotion and retention strategies.\n\n### Increased productivity [...] For example, agentic AI tools can handle time off requests, proactively generate relevant administrative related to major life events such as the birth of a new child or recommend career development opportunities based on an individual’s position and goals. By personalizing employee communication and support at scale, agentic AI allows HR professionals to focus on more intimate or urgent matters, ultimately increasing employee satisfaction.\n\n### Onboarding and training&quot;,

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Think of a call center or store environment. You generate an agentic customer, and you say, “This is a type of call. This is a type of customer. Record an interaction.” It’s not only simulating a real phone call. You’re also getting live, detailed scoring of how you, as a frontline employee, are doing in that interaction. Are you using the right words? Have you remembered every single step of the process? It gives you very detailed coaching instructions.&quot;,

To get the most out of these new teammates, leaders in HR and procurement will need to start developing an operational playbook for integrating them into hybrid teams and a workforce strategy.

Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview? [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there.&quot;,
