<ul>
  <li><b>ISG Report: AI Drives New ERP Capabilities, Workday Skills Spotlight (Dec 17, 2025)</b><br/>
    <p>A new <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202512170900BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251217_BW851395-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISG report</a> underscores the accelerating impact of AI within ERP. Workday is highlighted as a leader in combining its Skills Cloud with agentic AI workflows—enabling automated workforce management and compliance at scale. This evolution gives Deloitte and its clients a roadmap for operational efficiency and smarter planning, but increases the stakes for responsible data stewardship and AI governance across all deployments. The report signals that SAP, Oracle, and UKG are under pressure to close the gap on agentic skills frameworks, making GSI upskilling in Workday AI essential.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>IBM Spotlights Five Tech Trends for 2026: Agentic AI as Workforce Engine (Dec 17, 2025)</b><br/>
    <p>In <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/sarah-bowden/2025/12/17/new-ibm-research-five-tech-trends-that-will-shape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its latest tech trends study</a>, IBM places agentic AI at the center of next-generation HCM and ERP. Key enablers are robust data readiness, pipeline automation, and explainability—areas where Workday has invested via native governance and agentic system-of-record capabilities. For Deloitte’s practitioners, the mandate is to accelerate agentic-enablement and ecosystem integration skills, and to help clients audit their maturity for agentic transformation. The trend context puts a premium on cross-ecosystem collaboration and responsible AI implementation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>SAP</b>: SAP SuccessFactors is doubling down on adaptive AI, deeper skills-data fusion, and agentic workflow tools. These moves directly challenge Workday and push Deloitte to sharpen articulation of Workday’s Skills Cloud and agentic governance advantages. Innovation expectations are climbing for all clients.<br/></li>
  <li><b>UKG</b>: UKG’s Bryte AI-driven marketplace is growing, aiming for flexible agentic AI extensions to core workforce management. For Deloitte, the ecosystem trend points to multi-vendor agentic integration needs—not just Workday-native configurations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>AI-Enabled Data Governance in Workday</b>: <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/data-governance-automation-benefits-use-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> – Become proficient in assessing and implementing Workday’s data governance automation features, essential for risk mitigation and agentic deployments.</li>
  <li><b>Advising Clients on Agentic Maturity</b>: <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource</a> – Lead clients through agentic maturity assessments to identify high-value use cases and align with business needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Draft a client primer contrasting Workday, SAP, and UKG agentic strengths and value cases.</li>
  <li>Run knowledge-shares on Workday AI governance automation and skills frameworks.</li>
  <li>Update proposals to highlight agentic enablement, Skills Cloud, and Marketplace integration.</li>
  <li>Scout pilot clients for agentic AI co-innovation tied to analyst trend data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data readiness gaps:</b> Address via readiness workshops and use of Workday governance resources.</li>
  <li><b>Competitive differentiation loss:</b> Empower client teams with competitive briefings and Deloitte accelerators.</li>
</ul>

Today&#x27;s focus shifts to a deepened industry synthesis and competitive monitoring as major GSIs and SaaS players refine their agentic AI strategies. Emerging commentary highlights the importance of data readiness and governance for Workday clients.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;ISG Report: AI Drives New ERP Capabilities, Workday Skills Spotlight (Dec 17, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A new ISG report published on December 17, 2025, underscores the accelerating impact of AI within ERP platforms, with Workday cited as a leading innovator in the fusion of skills ontologies and autonomous workflows. The analysis emphasizes Workday’s unique strength in combining its Skills Cloud with agentic AI orchestration, enabling organizations to automate workforce management, compensation planning, and compliance tracking with increased agility and intelligence. The report further notes Workday’s integration of AI-driven data governance and analytics capabilities as essential enablers for real-time decision support.\\n\\nStrategically, this reinforces Workday’s differentiator around AI-native HCM and Finance, aligning with Deloitte’s Workday practice focus on embedding adaptive skills frameworks and process automation in client transformations. For end clients, the continued evolution of AI in Workday’s platform suggests immediate opportunities for greater operational efficiency and smarter workforce planning, but also raises the bar for data stewardship and responsible AI deployment. Deloitte practices should be prepared to guide organizations through AI readiness assessments—particularly around the Skills Cloud and governance best practices—ensuring both value realization and risk mitigation.\\n\\nFor the broader ecosystem, the report’s recognition of Workday foreshadows heightened competitive pressure for SAP, Oracle, and UKG to accelerate their agentic AI roadmaps and skills-based architectures. This is also an opportune prompt for GSIs to revisit their talent upskilling and data strategy offerings in the context of Workday’s maturing AI stack.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202512170900BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251217_BW851395-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;IBM Spotlights Five Tech Trends for 2026: Agentic AI as Workforce Engine (Dec 17, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On December 17, 2025, IBM published research identifying five technology trends set to shape enterprise strategies into 2026, with agentic AI and autonomous software flagged as central to next-generation workforce platforms. The trend analysis notes that businesses adopting agentic architectures—like those pioneered by Workday and its competitors—experience faster decision cycles, proactive compliance, and more personalized employee experiences. IBM specifically points to the need for robust data readiness, pipeline automation, and explainability within SaaS and HCM environments, echoing Workday’s emphasis on responsible AI governance and agentic system-of-record innovations.\\n\\nTechnically, this trend calls attention to the integration readiness of existing client architectures and the criticality of automated data flows and robust analytics. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the takeaway is twofold: firstly, that client value will increasingly depend on agentic-enablement of core HCM and Finance platforms; secondly, that cross-ecosystem integrations (including with IBM Watson, Azure, and Google AI toolkits) must be prioritized.\\n\\nFurthermore, IBM’s focus on explainability aligns with Workday’s ongoing communication around transparency and responsible use—making co-innovation in AI controls and skills explainability a tangible near-term consulting opportunity. Workday clients must be actively coached to assess their agentic maturity and data orchestration layers as the agentic wave becomes industry standard.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/sarah-bowden/2025/12/17/new-ibm-research-five-tech-trends-that-will-shape\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP continues to push adaptive AI capabilities within SuccessFactors HCM, introducing deeper skills-data integration and highlighting agentic workflow enhancements. Their recent updates also focus on RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) within HR experience hubs—bringing more advanced AI assistance to managers.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP’s AI focus directly challenges Workday’s leadership in agentic employee management and intelligent skills orchestration. SAP’s rapid iterations compel Deloitte’s Workday practitioners to reinforce Workday’s advantages: built-in Skills Cloud, transparent governance, and flexible agentic workflows. For clients, the competitive landscape means more rapid innovation cycles and higher expectations for skills-centered, AI-powered employee experiences. Deloitte must be ready to articulate ROI and facilitate proofs of value around Workday’s agentic modules versus SAP’s modular advances.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;UKG maintains momentum post-Bryte AI launch, building out its marketplace for agentic AI extensions targeting workforce and scheduling optimization.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;UKG’s focus on plug-and-play AI agent extensibility parallels Workday’s Marketplace strategy. For Deloitte, this highlights the growing client need for integrated, composable solutions that bridge core HCM with vertical and horizontal AI packages. This also signals an ecosystem trend where GSIs will need to architect multi-vendor agentic integrations, not just Workday-native solutions.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;AI-Enabled Data Governance in Workday\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/data-governance-automation-benefits-use-cases.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Ability to assess and implement AI-driven data governance features, mitigating risk and fostering readiness for agentic automation in Workday deployments.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Advising Clients on Agentic Maturity\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Deloitte consultants will confidently guide clients through agentic maturity assessments, identifying quick wins and aligning agentic initiatives to business value drivers.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Prepare a client-facing primer contrasting Workday, SAP, and UKG agentic AI capabilities with emphasis on data orchestration and responsible AI.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Schedule internal knowledge-sharing sessions on AI governance automation and explainable skills frameworks within Workday.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Develop updated proposal content for agentic enablement assessments tied to Workday’s Skills Cloud and Marketplace.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Identify early-adopter clients ready for agentic AI pilots and outline co-innovation opportunities, leveraging ISG and IBM trends.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Clients lack sufficient data quality and data pipeline automation to fully leverage Workday agentic capabilities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Prioritize AI/data readiness workshops as pre-requisite for agentic rollouts.
