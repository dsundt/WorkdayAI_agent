<li><strong>Capgemini: Trust and Human-AI Collaboration Set to Define Agentic AI, Unlocking $450B Opportunity by 2028 (2025-12-16)</strong><br>
<p>Capgemini’s latest press release and research predict agentic AI—focusing on trust, explainability, and human-AI collaboration—will generate $450B in global value by 2028. Organizations are shifting beyond single-task AI to orchestrated, outcome-driven agents across HR and finance, increasing pressure for SaaS vendors like Workday to embed transparency and auditability directly into AI features. The study signals that trust and governance will become critical buyer criteria. For Deloitte, this suggests opportunities to differentiate by advising and implementing responsible-agent frameworks. See the announcement at <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/trust-and-human-ai-collaboration-set-to-define-the-next-era-of-agentic-ai-unlocking-450-billion-opportunity-by-2028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capgemini</a>.</p></li>

<li><strong>IBM: Agentic AI for Enterprise Automation—How Watson Orchestrates Complex Business Flows (2025-12-16)</strong><br>
<p>IBM published a blog demonstrating agentic AI orchestration through Watson, showcasing how agents can manage complex, enterprise-scale workflows by combining cognitive and rules-based approaches. This raises expectations for SaaS vendors to support mix-and-match, multi-agent integration and governance. For Workday practitioners (and Deloitte), becoming fluent in orchestrating agents—including across platforms—is key to meeting evolving client demands. Read the full analysis at <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/shilpi-yadav/2025/12/16/agentic-ai-for-enterprise-automation-how-watson-or" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM Community</a>.</p></li>

<li><strong>Dux Raises $9M to Tackle AI-Driven Cyber Exposure and Agent Security (2025-12-16)</strong><br>
<p>Dux received $9M in seed funding to secure AI-agent-powered SaaS workflows against new cyber threats, highlighting the growing focus on agentic AI security at the enterprise board and CISO levels. Deloitte’s Workday teams should treat agentic AI security as a parallel priority to functional enablement, as threat modeling now factors into RFPs and client decision-making. Coverage is available at <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/16/dux-launches-9m-seed-round-tackle-ai-driven-cyber-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiliconANGLE</a>.</p></li>

Deloitte teams should continue readiness efforts and monitor the maturing competitive landscape.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini: Trust and Human-AI Collaboration Set to Define Agentic AI, Unlocking $450B Opportunity by 2028 (Published 2025-12-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini’s new research and press engagement assert that agentic AI, with a particular focus on trust and collaborative decision-making between humans and AI agents, is expected to realize a $450B global opportunity by 2028. The report highlights that organizations deploying agentic AI systems are moving past siloed task automation to orchestrated, outcome-driven processes encompassing HR, finance, and supply chain. The study emphasizes that trust—both in model transparency and human-in-the-loop supervision—will determine successful adoption in enterprise SaaS contexts.\\n\\nFor Workday and its ecosystem partners, this underlines the market imperative of embedding explainability, auditability, and assurance directly into agentic AI features, especially as clients weigh vendor choices based on risk and governance more than ever. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, differentiation will hinge on being able to both deploy these solutions and advise on governance frameworks, further aligning consulting value propositions with emerging client priorities on responsible AI operations.\\n\\nThe Capgemini paper is also important because it forecasts a rising tide of cross-vendor integrations and interoperable agent frameworks, which could disrupt Workday’s current ecosystem lock-in unless proactive moves are taken. Deloitte teams should be prepared for client inquiries about agent transparency, trust, and blended agent ecosystems.\\n\\nSource: https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/trust-and-human-ai-collaboration-set-to-define-the-next-era-of-agentic-ai-unlocking-450-billion-opportunity-by-2028\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.capgemini.com/news/press-releases/trust-and-human-ai-collaboration-set-to-define-the-next-era-of-agentic-ai-unlocking-450-billion-opportunity-by-2028\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;IBM: Agentic AI for Enterprise Automation—How Watson Orchestrates Complex Business Flows (Published 2025-12-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;IBM&#x27;s technical blog post provides an in-depth look at how agentic AI is operationalized for enterprise-scale automation with Watson, specifically highlighting use cases where agents coordinate complex business processes, manage exceptions, and interface with both structured and unstructured data. The spotlight on ‘agent orchestration’—where multiple AI agents collaborate with rules, policies, and human supervisors—suggests a model for next-generation SaaS platforms like Workday to incorporate blended cognitive and deterministic workflows.\\n\\nStrategically, this further elevates the bar for ‘AI readiness’ among SaaS HCM/finance vendors: Workday must continue to invest in open agent frameworks and flexible integration with external cognitive agents to keep pace. This IBM perspective indicates an emerging consensus among global SI partners and hyperscalers on the importance of orchestration, interoperability, and scalable AI governance—a key area where clients will look to consulting partners like Deloitte for both technical enablement and boundary-setting on responsible automation. \\n\\nWorkday-oriented teams should view this as a case to upskill on cross-agent orchestration patterns and anticipate RFPs querying how Workday can play with Watson, Azure OpenAI, and other agent-rich platforms, especially in regulated industries.\\n\\nSource: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/shilpi-yadav/2025/12/16/agentic-ai-for-enterprise-automation-how-watson-or\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/shilpi-yadav/2025/12/16/agentic-ai-for-enterprise-automation-how-watson-or\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Dux Raises $9M to Tackle AI-Driven Cyber Exposure and Agent Security (Published 2025-12-16)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Dux, a new startup, has secured $9M in seed funding aimed specifically at addressing the security exposure of AI-driven agents across SaaS workflows. Their mission focuses on providing continuous security validation and threat analysis as organization-wide AI adoption extends to agentic systems. The rapid funding round signals growing recognition at the CISO/board level that as agentic AI becomes common in platforms like Workday or SAP, the attack surface broadens—creating new risks around data leakage, automated errors, and policy overrides.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practitioners, the lesson is clear: agent security is now a board-level conversation, and implementation teams must address threat modeling in parallel with enablement. Clients will increasingly demand visibility into how SaaS vendors and partners mitigate new classes of AI-initiated breaches, making tight coordination between transformation, cyber, and risk teams mandatory during agent AI rollouts. This funding news foreshadows more M&amp;A and partnerships in the agent-AI security sub-sector—a crucial input into Workday roadmap conversations for 2026 and beyond.\\n\\nSource: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/16/dux-launches-9m-seed-round-tackle-ai-driven-cyber-exposure\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/16/dux-launches-9m-seed-round-tackle-ai-driven-cyber-exposure\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Released major cross-industry report and strategic framework on agentic AI, asserting $450B opportunity and competitive advantage via trust and governance.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Capgemini is setting the benchmark for agentic AI discourse among GSIs, SI partners, and SaaS buyers, shaping buying criteria around agent trust, explainability, and cross-vendor agent orchestration.
