<ul>
  <li><strong>No Major Developments Detected in Workday or Extended Ecosystem (Dec 31, 2025 – Jan 1, 2026 ET)</strong><br />
    <p>A review of all pre-authorized and relevant sources during the specified research window indicates no material announcements, partnerships, competitive launches, analyst commentary, or strategic moves impacting Workday’s HCM, Extend, Skills Cloud, or agentic SaaS AI. This lull is not unusual around major holidays but underscores a temporary period of stability for Workday prospects, client strategy, and associated consulting efforts. <a href="https://www.workday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Workday.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Deloitte’s Workday practice should use this window to double down on enablement, review existing guidance, and proactively prepare for expected January 2026 product and ecosystem activity. Ongoing monitoring remains critical for early detection of any competitive or technological inflection points.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All Key Players:</strong> No major updates or launches impacting the Workday agentic AI ecosystem in the past 24 hours.<br />
    <p>Current competitive positions are sustained, with no immediate threats or opportunities introduced since the previous monitoring period. This allows Deloitte’s Workday and HR tech teams to maintain strategic posture and focus on planned internal initiatives.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>AI Agent Enablement Fundamentals (Workday, ServiceNow, ADP):</strong>
    <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read Workday's Agentic AI Use Cases</a><br>
    90-day outcome: Consultants and solution architects demonstrate foundational knowledge of agentic AI use cases in HR, enabling faster requirements gathering and differentiation in client proposals.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue vigilant daily monitoring for Workday and SaaS AI ecosystem updates.</li>
  <li>Schedule internal enablement workshops focused on agentic AI best practices and client use cases.</li>
  <li>Review and refresh competitive briefs in anticipation of post-holiday announcement cycles.</li>
  <li>Connect with existing clients about Year-End transitions and expected Q1 2026 Workday product updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Complacency due to holiday news lull may delay response to January announcements.<br>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Maintain daily research cadence and proactively review enablement resources to ensure readiness for rapid response.
