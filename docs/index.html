    <strong>Endava Deepens Cognition Partnership to Scale Governed Agentic AI Deployments (2026-02-18):</strong>
    <p>Endava’s announcement of an expanded Cognition partnership directly targets the challenge of bringing agentic AI from controlled pilots to enterprise-scale production in a responsible and compliant manner. By leveraging Cognition’s orchestration layer and Endava’s global SI capabilities, the offering is designed to ensure not just advanced automation, but also continuous risk monitoring, compliance adherence, and trustworthiness of agentic AI agents operating across complex enterprise workloads. This is especially pertinent for Workday enterprises, which are under growing pressure from boards and regulators to prove the auditability and governance of AI-powered business processes. For Deloitte, the so-what is intensified: client conversations must now consider operational governance, deployment rigor, and not just model or platform selection—increasing the value of Deloitte’s cross-disciplinary risk and AI advisory.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Endava:</strong> Expanded partnership with Cognition to deliver governed, enterprise-grade agentic AI platforms.<br>
    <em>Implication:</em> This move signals a clear shift toward mature, operationalized agentic AI, and drives expectations for equivalent governance in Workday’s ecosystem. Deloitte’s client-facing teams need to deepen playbooks on AI governance, orchestration, and integration into Workday deployments.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Governed Agentic AI Deployment in the Enterprise:</strong>
    <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202602180500BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260218_BW013639-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Training on partner approaches</a>.<br>
    <em>90-day outcome:</em> Practitioners will be able to design, assess, and roadmap agentic AI solution architectures for Workday clients, with particular emphasis on reliability, risk controls, and regulatory compliance.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Brief client teams and practitioners on the strategic implications of governed agentic AI, referencing Endava-Cognition as a benchmark.</li>
  <li>Reassess Deloitte’s existing Workday AI offerings to benchmark compliance and governance functionality.</li>
  <li>Enhance client readiness and assessment frameworks to include rapidly emerging standards in agent orchestration, reliability monitoring, and responsible AI in SaaS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Risk:</strong> Partner-led innovation in governed agentic AI could outpace Deloitte’s own integration and controls, increasing security or compliance risks for joint Workday deployments.<br>
    <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Tighten collaboration between AI, risk, and Workday leaders to continually update Deloitte’s solution accelerators with best-in-class governance practices gleaned from the latest ecosystem advances.

For Deloitte, the focus must remain on interpreting disruptive potential, preparing clients for rapid operationalization, and ensuring responsible, scalable adoption.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Endava Deepens Cognition Partnership to Scale Governed Agentic AI Deployments (2026-02-18)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Endava has announced an expansion of its partnership with Cognition, a move explicitly targeting the scaling of governed, enterprise-ready agentic AI solutions. This partnership combines Endava’s systems integration expertise with Cognition’s agentic orchestration platform, addressing a prominent barrier in enterprise AI: responsible, large-scale deployment. The joint offering emphasizes compliance, reliability, and continuous monitoring, focusing on trustworthiness as agentic agents automate complex business tasks.   \\n\\nThis development is significant for Workday and its ecosystem because Deloitte’s own research and client experience indicate that as generative AI adoption matures, the competitive advantage increasingly hinges not just on advanced model capabilities but on seamless orchestration, risk management, and integration into existing SaaS investments. By foregrounding governed agentic AI at scale, Endava and Cognition are providing an operational template that directly addresses enterprise hesitance—around ‘shadow AI,’ regulatory scrutiny, and ethical risk—that often stalls pilot projects.  \\n\\nFor Deloitte practitioners, the message is clear: clients will increasingly demand not only best-in-breed AI models but also robust deployment governance. Partnerships like this raise the standard for what constitutes ‘enterprise-ready’ agentic AI—prompting both GSIs and SaaS vendors like Workday to accelerate offerings around AI compliance frameworks and embedded reliability features. The implication: Deloitte should continue investing in risk-managed, operational AI accelerators that are natively extensible to platforms like Workday.  \\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202602180500BIZWIRE_USPRX____20260218_BW013639-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Endava\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Expanded partnership with Cognition to deliver governed, enterprise-grade agentic AI platforms.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This signals a shift toward operationalizing agentic AI at large scale while maintaining compliance and trust—raising expectations among enterprise customers for similar offerings in Workday and its ecosystem.

By leveraging Cognition’s orchestration layer and Endava’s global SI capabilities, the offering is designed to ensure not just advanced automation, but also continuous risk monitoring, compliance adherence, and trustworthiness of agentic AI agents operating across complex enterprise workloads. This is especially pertinent for Workday enterprises, which are under growing pressure from boards and regulators to prove the auditability and governance of AI-powered business processes.
