This reflects a period of normal operational cadence, providing client stakeholders and Deloitte practitioners with stability for planning and prioritization.</p><p>For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this offers a rare, small window with no immediate external pivots to react to. This gap should be leveraged to deepen team enablement, stress-test advisory approaches given overall AI and HR tech trends from earlier in the week, and proactively reach out to clients to reinforce readiness for expected 2026 developments in agentic AI and SaaS-enabled workforce transformation.</p><p>Continuous ecosystem surveillance and practitioner upskilling remain critical, as recent weeks have shown that agentic AI and HR SaaS ecosystems can change swiftly. Succinct client communication of this status affirms Deloitte’s role as a vigilant and transparent partner. <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p></li></ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2><ul><li><strong>Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce</strong> – No public launch or repositioning of AI/agentic HR features, governance frameworks, or announced large-scale deployments in the past 24 hours.<br><p>For Workday and Deloitte practitioners, this one-day period of competitive stability provides a chance to consolidate learnings from prior releases and sector shifts. It is also an opportunity for Deloitte to connect with clients on medium-term planning for AI adoption and agentic workflow integration before the announcement cycle resumes.</p></li></ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2><ul><li><strong>Deep Dive on Workday AI Agents for HR – Use Cases & Client Outcomes</strong><br><a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html</a><br>In the next 90 days, consultants will develop nuanced, client-facing expertise to identify and frame agentic AI opportunities, driving stronger client engagement and advisory value in HCM/HR transformation projects.</li></ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2><ul><li>Maintain close monitoring of Workday, competitor, and analyst news feeds for any post-weekend updates or late-breaking product news.</li><li>Continue practice-wide enablement on Workday's agentic AI use cases using the official Workday blog as a foundation for customer-facing workshops and readiness sessions.</li><li>Survey client teams to confirm their 2026 agentic AI strategy status and readiness, focusing on converting advisory insights into concrete project roadmaps.</li></ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2><ul><li><strong>Complacency due to a perceived pause in ecosystem activity.</strong><br>Mitigation: Reinforce continuous learning cycles, communicate ‘no-news’ as a positive planning interval, and build proactive outreach to clients emphasizing the value of vigilance.</li></ul>

Maintaining vigilance is key as the pace of innovation remains high.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;No Significant Developments in Workday or Agentic SaaS AI in the Last 24 Hours (as of Dec 19, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;A comprehensive scan of the vetted ecosystem sources—including Workday’s own blogs, major consultancy advisories, and leading analyst and competitive vendor feeds—indicates that there have been no substantive new developments, launches, or key strategy commentaries relevant to Workday AI, its partnerships, or primary competitive moves over the last daily window (2025-12-18T06:40 to 2025-12-19T06:40 ET). This reflects a period of normal operational cadence, providing client stakeholders and Deloitte practitioners with stability for planning and prioritization.\\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, this provides a rare, small window with no immediate external pivots to react to. This gap should be leveraged to deepen team enablement, stress-test advisory approaches given overall AI and HR tech trends from earlier in the week, and proactively reach out to clients to reinforce readiness for expected 2026 developments in agentic AI and SaaS-enabled workforce transformation.\\n\\nContinuous ecosystem surveillance and practitioner upskilling remain critical, as recent weeks have repeatedly shown that agentic AI and HR SaaS ecosystems can change swiftly with new product, operational, or governance disruptions. Succinct communication of this stability status to clients affirms Deloitte’s role as a vigilant and transparent partner.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG, ADP, Dayforce\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;No public launch or repositioning of AI/agentic HR features, governance frameworks, or announced large-scale deployments in the past 24 hours.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;For Workday and Deloitte practitioners, this one-day period of competitive stability provides a chance to consolidate learnings from prior releases and sector shifts.
