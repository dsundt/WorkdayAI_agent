<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Box:</strong> Agentic data extraction advances automation benchmarks for SaaS, meaning Workday and Deloitte must elevate their integration game and user experience standards. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/15/box-unlocks-agentic-data-extraction-help-companies-dig-insights-faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>DianaHR:</strong> Autonomous onboarding exemplifies what horizontal, process-driven agents can deliver; Workday and partners are now under pressure to match or beat these capabilities. (<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/15/dianahr-deploys-onboarding-agent-cut-hrs-paperwork-gravity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li>

These developments reflect rapid enterprise adoption of agentic patterns that will shape how Workday solutions interoperate and compete.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Box Unveils Agentic Data Extraction for Accelerated Insights (Published 2026-01-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Box has introduced agentic data extraction features, leveraging autonomous AI to help companies process and surface insights from unstructured data faster than before. By employing agent-driven mechanisms, Box empowers users to automate previously manual, tedious data cataloguing and analysis tasks. Strategically, this move signals the rising importance of embedded agentic AI across SaaS, and illustrates how vendors adjacent to Workday’s own ecosystem are racing to deliver practical, business-oriented AI automation. Technically, Box adopts frameworks that minimize human intervention and maximize context-driven actions, setting competitive benchmarks for ease of use and speed in AI-powered content services. For enterprise Workday clients, this means expectations are being set externally for systems that can do more with less friction, pushing internal stakeholders to review their own automation roadmaps and elevating the pressure for Workday and partners (including Deloitte) to accelerate the integration of similar agent-driven features. For Deloitte, there is opportunity in guiding Workday clients to architect data strategies that are ‘agent-ready,’ ensuring that clients are not left behind as adjacent platforms gain productivity edge with autonomous workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/15/box-unlocks-agentic-data-extraction-help-companies-dig-insights-faster\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;DianaHR Deploys Agentic Onboarding to Slash Paperwork (Published 2026-01-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;DianaHR launched an AI agent dedicated to onboarding processes, drastically reducing manual HR paperwork and process latency. This development provides a concrete example of how agentic AI is moving from vision to deployment in practical HR functions, shifting the paradigm from decision-support AI to decision/action-taking agents. With agentic onboarding, HR departments offload routine tasks such as form collection, compliance checks, and document routing to an AI-driven agent, allowing human HR professionals to focus on higher-value functions. For the Workday ecosystem, DianaHR’s approach acts as a harbinger for similar innovations—particularly as Workday partners and clients look for plug-and-play solutions to reduce bottlenecks across talent workflows. Deloitte’s Workday practice must recognize the value of these specialized, agent-powered solutions and anticipate client demand for seamless integration of such automations within Workday HCM. That provides an opening for high-value advisory and custom integration services to modernize onboarding journeys while maintaining governance and employee experience standards.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/15/dianahr-deploys-onboarding-agent-cut-hrs-paperwork-gravity\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Tines Launches AI Layer to Orchestrate Agents and Copilots (Published 2026-01-15)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Tines has released an interaction layer that unifies disparate AI agents, copilots, and workflow automations, aiming to streamline and orchestrate complex enterprise processes. This launch reflects a critical leap for organizations seeking not just to deploy point AI solutions, but to integrate and manage agentic AI at scale. The Tines approach reduces the fragmentation of AI project silos by providing a management and coordination plane for different autonomous workers—an architecture directly relevant to any enterprise scaling Workday or other SaaS applications with agentic capabilities. For technical leaders, this offers a blueprint for orchestrating Workday Extend, Skills Cloud, and external agentic platforms, thus supporting more agile, resilient, and cost-effective digital operations. For Deloitte, this presents dual relevance: first, it identifies opportunities to consult on the roadmap for agent ‘mesh’ architectures; second, it reinforces the need to anticipate client questions on workflow interoperability across best-of-breed SaaS and AI ecosystems.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/15/tines-launches-ai-interaction-layer-unify-agents-copilots-workflows\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Box\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Rolled out agentic data extraction to automate and accelerate data-driven business insights.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Box’s innovation raises user expectations around embedded AI-powered autonomy in enterprise SaaS, putting pressure on Workday (and consultants) to match seamless data automation across HR and finance content.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;DianaHR\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched agent-based HR onboarding to streamline talent integration, cut paperwork, and reduce administrative overhead.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;DianaHR’s agentic approach in HR onboarding demonstrates practical SaaS AI differentiation, pressuring Workday and its service partners to showcase superior or interoperable automation in core HR processes.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Tines\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Introduced an orchestration layer enabling unified control over multiple autonomous agents and AI copilots within enterprise workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Tines offers a model for connective agentic infrastructure, emphasizing the need for Workday and Deloitte to consult on orchestrating AI-driven/hr SaaS tools efficiently, bridging fragmentation for clients.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Understanding Agentic AI Patterns\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/video/4115615/what-are-ambient-agents-why-ai-that-acts-will-redefine-automation-at-work.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Ability to map agentic patterns to Workday solution designs and consult on agent-driven automation for Deloitte clients.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;AI in HR—Applications and Examples\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-ca/topics/ai/ai-in-hr.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Confidently advise clients on the concrete benefits and limitations of integrating AI into HR processes within the Workday stack.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Assess current Workday client readiness for agentic automation by reviewing their data architecture and workflow bottlenecks.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Initiate an internal enablement session on practical agent orchestration frameworks (using Box and Tines cases as models).\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Engage clients piloting Workday Extend or Skills Cloud to identify automation opportunities inspired by recent SaaS agent launches.\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Draft advisory material outlining agentic integration touchpoints between Workday and external HR/Collaboration SaaS.\&quot;\n  ],\n  \&quot;risks\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;risk\&quot;: \&quot;Escalating user expectations for highly autonomous, cross-platform workflows outpace Workday&#x27;s current embedded AI capabilities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;mitigation\&quot;: \&quot;Prioritize client education and pilot programs on integrating external agentic platforms with Workday;
