<ul>
  <li><b>Box's AI agents extend A2A business vision (Published 2025-12-01)</b><br/>
    <p>Box announced new advancements in its <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/box-ai-agents-a2a-googlecloudaiagentsinaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI agent ecosystem</a>, progressing its "A2A" (agent-to-agent) vision to automate enterprise workflows. With generative AI agents orchestrating tasks and integrating with Google Cloud, Box sets a competitive example of how content, talent, and workflow platforms can be seamlessly connected. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this signals surging client expectations for agentic interoperability, underscoring the need for robust, ethical, and compliant agentic process automation across all SaaS deployments.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Netskope strengthens AI agent security with MCP controls (Published 2025-12-01)</b><br/>
    <p>Netskope's new <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/netskope-adds-mcp-security-controls-protect-enterprise-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Managed Control Points</a> provide advanced detection and adaptive controls for AI agent behaviors across enterprise applications. As SaaS ecosystems, including HR and finance, adopt more agentic automation, the attack surface grows. Netskope’s move emphasizes the urgent necessity for proactive agent security, especially with sensitive data involved. Deloitte’s Workday team must highlight security-led transformation strategies as a distinct value, ensuring secure AI adoption for clients.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Industry continues agentic AI focus at AWS re:Invent (Published 2025-12-01)</b><br/>
    <p>Announcements from <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202512010905BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251201_BW174264-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elastic and AWS partners</a> stress the criticality of AI agent observability and traceability. This reflects growing client demand for auditable, explainable, and compliant agent deployments—key for HR and finance digital transformation. For Deloitte and Workday, developing team skills in monitoring, debugging, and governing multi-agent workflows will be essential for trust and regulatory compliance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>

However, related announcements from Box, Netskope, and ongoing AWS re:Invent discussions reinforce industry urgency around agentic AI, observability, and AI agent security in enterprise environments.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Box&#x27;s AI agents extend A2A business vision (Published 2025-12-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On December 1, Box announced advancements in its AI agent ecosystem, pushing forward its \\\&quot;A2A\\\&quot; (agent-to-agent) vision for automating complex business workflows across enterprise content platforms. Box showcased developments in generative AI agents that can orchestrate tasks, extract context, and automate content approval flows, integrating closely with cloud providers like Google Cloud. This highlights a strategic shift: SaaS applications are moving from point AI features to truly agentic, collaborative systems, echoing Workday&#x27;s emphasis on agentic HR and finance workflows. The technical significance lies in multi-agent coordination, secure orchestration of sensitive data, and seamless interoperability between content-management and business process platforms. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, Box&#x27;s move is a bellwether: clients expect composability between SaaS ecosystems, and demand is rising for integrated agentic experiences across content, talent, and workflow domains—necessitating robust integration and security architectures in joint deployments. This underlines the need for Workday to prioritize agentic interoperability and ethical, compliant AI task automation to remain competitive. \\n\\nSource: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/box-ai-agents-a2a-googlecloudaiagentsinaction\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/box-ai-agents-a2a-googlecloudaiagentsinaction\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Netskope strengthens AI agent security with MCP controls (Published 2025-12-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Netskope introduced new adaptive security controls—the Managed Control Points (MCP)—designed to protect enterprise AI agents against emerging threats. Announced December 1, these controls detect risky agent behaviors, prevent credential misuse, and enforce data sovereignty for AI-driven applications. The move is a response to rising concern about the attack surface introduced by proliferating agentic workflows in SaaS, including HCM and ERP platforms. For Workday and Deloitte clients, Netskope’s solution highlights an urgent need to audit, govern, and wrap additional security layers around agentic integrations, especially as organizations expand the scope of autonomous AI in sensitive finance and HR domains. \\n\\nThis competitive security layer further emphasizes that as agentic AI becomes central to SaaS operations, mature governance frameworks, zero-trust architectures, and continuous monitoring will be a differentiator when deploying solutions such as Workday Skills Cloud, Extend, or AI Marketplace. For Deloitte, it is essential to remain current on security best practices to advise clients on secure adoption and governance of AI agents within the Workday ecosystem and beyond. \\n\\nSource: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/netskope-adds-mcp-security-controls-protect-enterprise-ai-agents\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/01/netskope-adds-mcp-security-controls-protect-enterprise-ai-agents\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Industry continues agentic AI focus at AWS re:Invent with expanded observability and governance tools (Published 2025-12-01)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;AWS re:Invent sessions and partner launches over the past 24 hours highlight a broad and accelerating focus on agentic AI enablement and governance. Partners like Elastic announced new observability layers specifically designed for AI agents powered by Amazon Bedrock, reflecting growing enterprise demand for transparent, auditable workflows. These announcements reinforce the need for SaaS providers—including Workday and its consulting partners—to embrace not just the technical deployment of autonomous agents, but also to ensure traceability, compliance, and explainability in production environments. \\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the takeaway is clear: next-generation skills in AI agent observability, root-cause analysis, and multi-agent orchestration will become prerequisites for enterprise HR and finance transformation projects, ensuring trust and regulatory alignment as clients push deeper into autonomous business processes.\\n\\nSource: https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202512010905BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251201_BW174264-1\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202512010905BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251201_BW174264-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Box\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Unveiled advanced AI agent orchestration for enterprise content automation, integrating with cloud providers.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Heightens competitive pressure for SaaS platform providers like Workday to deliver deeper agentic interoperability across document, HR, and workflow platforms.
