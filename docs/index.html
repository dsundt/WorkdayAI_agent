<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday Again Named a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software (Dec 4, 2025)</strong><br/><p>Workday has once again been positioned as a leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software, sustaining this position for the fourth year. The analyst report points to Workday’s breadth in financial planning, deep integration with HR and analytics, and strong innovation cycle around AI-powered capabilities. <br/><br/>Strategically, this places Workday ahead in the minds of enterprise buyers demanding comprehensive, AI-driven planning solutions. The persistent analyst endorsement provides validation for existing clients and new prospects evaluating the platform, reducing perceived risk and enhancing deal confidence. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this recognition is an immediately reusable asset in competitive RFP response, positioning Deloitte as the trusted partner to help clients extract maximum value from Workday’s maturing finance and HCM stack.</p>

  <li><strong>Workday President to Present at Barclays 23rd Annual Global Technology Conference (Announced Dec 4, 2025)</strong><br/><p>Workday confirmed that President Robynne Sisco will present at the upcoming Barclays Global Technology Conference. Such leadership visibility underscores Workday’s intent to define key market themes—especially regarding finance, HCM, and AI priorities. While not a new solution announcement per se, these sessions tend to set the tone for 2026 enterprise evaluations and client conversations.<br/><br/>For Deloitte, tracking and amplifying Workday’s leadership commentary at Barclays enables faster dissemination of future-oriented messaging into both internal training and client briefings. Sisco's participation signals that Workday is prioritizing continued innovation and transparency—important angles for differentiating the platform in strategic deals.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SAP</strong>:<br/><p>SAP continues to enhance AI features within its SuccessFactors suite, particularly around agentic and skills-based capabilities. However, in the last 24 hours, no net-new updates shifted their position. Workday’s current analyst recognition remains unmatched in financial planning, providing a clear messaging advantage in enterprise platform selection cycles. This gap should be leveraged in deal strategies and client workshops.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Oracle</strong>:<br/><p>No significant new moves from Oracle were announced in the last 24-hour window. Oracle keeps investing in AI for HCM and ERP, but Workday’s fresh third-party validation strengthens its posture, especially for finance-focused buying groups. Deloitte can use this window to reinforce Workday’s edge when competitive activity is quieter.</p></li>
  <li><strong>UKG</strong>:<br/><p>UKG’s emphasis remains on its Bryte AI agents and ongoing client enablement, but without significant product expansion in this period. Market impact from this continues, but the latest independent recognition for Workday sets a higher bar for credibility and trust with finance and HR leaders.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Articulating Workday’s Leadership in Financial Planning and AI</strong> - <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-2025-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Financial-Planning-Software-for-Fourth-Year-in-a-Row" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner MQ Source</a><br/>In the next 90 days, enable client teams to confidently position Workday’s finance and analytics stack as both innovative and low-risk, supported by visible analyst validation. This reinforces Deloitte’s advisory credibility in client pursuits.</li>
  <li><strong>Staying Informed on Workday Executive Messaging</strong> - <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-President-to-Present-at-Barclays-23rd-Annual-Global-Technology-Conference-on-December-11,-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barclays Conference Announcement</a><br/>Use ongoing Workday executive insights to update strategy decks, pursuit materials, and internal enablement—empowering teams to act on the very latest messages and product priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Attend or review highlights from the Barclays Conference keynote for the clearest forecast of Workday’s upcoming AI and platform vision.</li>
  <li>Refresh all external and internal facing material to spotlight Workday’s new Magic Quadrant recognition, especially for prospects in financial services, healthcare, and multi-entity environments.</li>
  <li>Track any rapid response from SAP, Oracle, or UKG to shift the competitive narrative.</li>
  <li>Study and share forward-looking commentary from Workday’s leadership for immediate client application.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk</strong>: Loss of narrative control due to competitor messaging.<br/><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Ensure teams are equipped with latest analyst accolades and clear, recent leadership proof points to maintain market messaging leadership.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk</strong>: Over-reliance on legacy recognition metrics.<br/><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Supplement reference to past recognition with current insights from executive conferences and product roadmap updates.</li>

The report highlights Workday&#x27;s comprehensive financial planning capabilities, robust AI-powered analytics, and seamless integration with other Workday modules as key differentiators. \\n\\nThis endorsement comes at a critical juncture as organizations increasingly demand unified, AI-infused planning solutions capable of responding to market volatility and labor transformation. Workday’s consistency in maintaining top placement sends a powerful signal to both enterprise buyers and implementation partners: its platform remains a low-risk, high-value choice for finance transformation initiatives. \\n\\nFor Deloitte’s Workday practice, the recognition bolsters client confidence—validating recommendations to adopt or expand Workday Financial Management, especially for organizations contemplating multi-year digital finance strategies. The ability to point to sustained third-party analyst validation gives practitioners an edge in proposals and strengthens cross-sell opportunities around AI, planning, and adjacent HCM capabilities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-Recognized-as-a-Leader-in-2025-Gartner-R-Magic-Quadrant-TM-for-Financial-Planning-Software-for-Fourth-Year-in-a-Row\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday President to Present at Barclays 23rd Annual Global Technology Conference (Announced Dec 4, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced that its President, Robynne Sisco, will speak at the Barclays 23rd Annual Global Technology Conference on December 11, 2025. This high-profile participation underscores Workday&#x27;s ongoing efforts to maintain investor and analyst engagement through transparent leadership communication. \\n\\nSuch conference appearances are strategic for reinforcing Workday’s positioning not just as a SaaS HCM and finance provider, but as a future-forward platform prioritizing AI and extensibility. It is anticipated that Sisco will address current enterprise finance trends, AI plans, and the broader innovation roadmap. While no new product launch is directly tied to this announcement, these forums typically set the narrative for the next wave of client and partner investments heading into 2026.\\n\\nFor Deloitte teams, the upcoming session presents an opportunity to monitor fresh messaging on Workday’s vision—especially any forward-looking comments on AI, skills transformation, or ecosystem expansion—that can be amplified in client conversations, pursuits, and practice enablement activities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-12-04-Workday-President-to-Present-at-Barclays-23rd-Annual-Global-Technology-Conference-on-December-11,-2025\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;SAP continues to advance both its agentic and AI-powered features within its SuccessFactors HCM suite, as reported in prior analysis. No significant new SAP updates emerged in the past 24 hours.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;SAP&#x27;s persistent push into AI, particularly in skills and agentic workflows, keeps up competitive pressure. However, Workday’s latest analyst validation in financial planning is currently unmatched by synonymous recognition on the SAP side. This differential may sway enterprise finance and HR buyers evaluating best-of-breed cloud platforms, favoring Workday’s integrated stack and analyst credibility.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle remains a prominent player in cloud HCM and ERP, with ongoing AI and large-language-model investments. As of this past day, no headline developments directly relevant to AI agentic capabilities or competitive momentum were published.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;The absence of high-visibility updates from Oracle in the current cycle leaves the competitive landscape relatively stable for Workday.

The analyst report points to Workday’s breadth in financial planning, deep integration with HR and analytics, and strong innovation cycle around AI-powered capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategically, this places Workday ahead in the minds of enterprise buyers demanding comprehensive, AI-driven planning solutions. The persistent analyst endorsement provides validation for existing clients and new prospects evaluating the platform, reducing perceived risk and enhancing deal confidence.

Such leadership visibility underscores Workday’s intent to define key market themes—especially regarding finance, HCM, and AI priorities. While not a new solution announcement per se, these sessions tend to set the tone for 2026 enterprise evaluations and client conversations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Deloitte, tracking and amplifying Workday’s leadership commentary at Barclays enables faster dissemination of future-oriented messaging into both internal training and client briefings.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;workday is AE, then (I didn&#x27;t know that)  \n   \n I believe we would only say a working day for a day when you you choose or are assigned to work (if you don&#x27;t have a standard Mon-Fri work assignment).  \n   \n Next week Saturday is a working day (or workday) for me, so I can&#x27;t play golf then. Si j&#x27;ai bien compris l&#x27;exemple donné par staarkali, ça pourrait être l&#x27;équivalent de jour ouvré. [...] My understanding of the GDT definitions is that you cannot say jour ouvré, unless you actually work that day.   \n   \n Monday to Friday is the regular workweek/working week or schedule of workdays/working days.   \n   \n Some places open on Saturday, and other places (e.g. convenience stores) are open 7 days a week. You can be scheduled to work, or not. Those days are all ouvrables but not necessarity ouvrés (worked) by every employee on the payroll. [...] I also say workday, for jour ouvrable, though I don&#x27;t mind working day. But jour ouvrable suivant = next business day. I thik business day is mostly used for commerce and finance.   \n   \n Now - as already suggested - there is a difference to be made between jour ouvré and jour ouvrable.   \n   \n As found in the GDT, under jour ouvrable  \n&gt; Définition :  \n&gt;  Jour de la semaine qui est normalement consacré au travail ou aux activités professionnelles et qui n&#x27;est pas un jour férié.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;CMOs&#x27; Top Challenges &amp; Priorities For 2026&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A Gartner survey of 413 marketing technology leaders conducted in June through July 2025 found 81% of marketing technology leaders are either piloting, or have already implemented, AI agents in their organizations. Marketing technology, particularly AI, has become one of the top priorities for CMOs. [...] CMOs are taking a critical eye to their martech, particularly looking at AI agents and automation, as well as opportunities for consolidation within existing stacks. Beyond AI agents, changing customer search behaviours driven by technologies, including ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews, mean that CMOs are reevaluating their approach to search. [...] CMOs also face increased demands on their already stretched budgets as a result of evolving technology and changing customer habits. For example, as customers adopt GenAI tools and agents, CMOs must create dual strategies for both human and AI customer personas - which brings additional operational complexity. While CMOs are enthusiastic about AI agents, many organizations are failing to see significant return on their AI investments.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Kiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls \&quot;agentic AI\&quot; — artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods. [...] The first component is a steering file called POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual for the AI agent. It tells the agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;She noted that although the bill mandates comprehensive assessments of “software paid for, in use, or deployed,” it neglects critical facets of today’s AI software landscape. “It never defines how you access an AI agent that writes its own code, a foundation model trained on proprietary data, or an API that charges per token instead of per seat,” she said. “Instead of oversight, the bill would unlock chaos, potentially creating a compliance framework where CIOs could be punished for buying too [...] Timsah said that the bill “is going to be very difficult to implement and to measure. How do you measure it is being followed?” She added that agencies will parrot the bill’s wording and then try to hire people to manage the process. “It’s just going to be for optic’s sake.”\n\n## Related content\n\n### Agents-as-a-service are poised to rewire the software industry and corporate structures\n\n### Building resilience for AI workloads in the cloud [...] many seats for a software tool, but face zero accountability for safely, properly, and ethically deploying AI systems.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By the end of this tutorial, you&#x27;ll have a working Amazon Bedrock agent that can understand natural language requests for date and time information and respond with accurate data from your Lambda function.\n\nThis tutorial is based on the agent code example in the AWS documentation GitHub repository.\n\n###### Topics [...] Prerequisites\n Step 1: Create a Lambda function\n Step 2: Create an Amazon Bedrock agent\n Step 3: Test the agent\n Step 4: Deploy the agent with an alias\n Step 5: Call the agent from Python code\n Step 6: Clean up resources\n Additional resources\n\nDocument Conventions\n\nSupported Regions\n\nPrerequisites\n\nDid this page help you? - Yes\n\nThanks for letting us know we&#x27;re doing a good job!\n\nIf you&#x27;ve got a moment, please tell us what we did right so we can do more of it.\n\nDid this page help you? - No [...] 4. Deploy the agent with an alias — Create a version of your agent and deploy it with an alias to make it available for use.\n5. Call the agent from Python code — Learn how to programmatically interact with your agent using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto).\n6. Clean up resources — Remove the AWS resources created during this tutorial to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents consists of the following two main sets of API operations to help you set up and run an agent:\n\n Build-time API operations to create, configure, and manage your agents and their related resources\n Runtime API operations to invoke your agent with user input and to initiate orchestration to carry out a task\n\n## Build-time configuration\n\nAn agent consists of the following components: [...] Foundation model – You choose a foundation model (FM) that the agent invokes to interpret user input and subsequent prompts in its orchestration process. The agent also invokes the FM to generate responses and follow-up steps in its process.\n Instructions – You write instructions that describe what the agent is designed to do. With advanced prompts, you can further customize instructions for the agent at every step of orchestration and include Lambda functions to parse each step&#x27;s output. [...] + Action groups – You define the actions that the agent should perform for the user (through providing the following resources):\n\n    - One of the following schemas to define the parameters that the agent needs to elicit from the user (each action group can use a different schema):&quot;,

You can use these attributes to provide and manage context in a conversation between users and the agent.&quot;,

Conversely, Boomi only has 296 connectors and 329 documented recipes–according to my last count in early 2025.

You can be scheduled to work, or not. Those days are all ouvrables but not necessarity ouvrés (worked) by every employee on the payroll.&quot;,

That raises a real question: How can loyalty data and related personalization add value in the age of AI? [...] Make loyalty data shareable. Allow trusted third-party platforms to access loyalty profiles, points, and preferences—securely and with user consent.\n Structure identity and preference data.

Soon, more platforms will offer AI-enabled ways to book flights and hotels. While full AI-led travel transactions aren’t here yet, the user behavior shift is—and it’s accelerating.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI-powered risk and compliance&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Traditional scenario planning often falters because of insufficient data needed to replicate real-world situations and varying risk factors. That’s where AI comes in. It can quickly generate synthetic data needed to mimic and test any hypothetical scenario—e.g., modeling of policy or geopolitical shifts and their potential impact on company operations—enabling you to make strategic decisions with greater speed and confidence.\n\n### Build a virtual regulator [...] outputs can give your teams an important head start and uncover issues and patterns no human could spot unaided. [...] As confidence grows and regulatory expectations evolve, senior executives now see a window to modernize responsibly—using AI not just to spur efficiency but to drive speed, capacity, and growth. The need for speed and smart risk-taking is more pressing than ever as companies navigate the uncertainty of geopolitical shifts, regulatory change, and the latest advances in technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is the rise of agentic commerce: AI agents acting on behalf of users to discover, recommend, and eventually transact. It’s reshaping the travel industry’s front door, and companies need to act quickly to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n## The disappearing search bar and a new route to discovery [...] ## Don’t just respond—reimagine your role\n\nAgentic commerce won’t change travel overnight. The transactional layer may take time to mature. But the discovery layer is already shifting, and travelers are building new habits fast.\n\nThis is a chance for travel brands to rethink how they appear, compete, and build loyalty in AI-led experiences. When the journey begins—and perhaps ends—with a prompt, the companies that act now will determine who’s still visible when the map redraws. [...] Steps to consider:\n\n Design the experience. Map how travelers interact across search, plan, book, and manage, then shape your site’s flow, brand voice, and interface to match. Add clear confirmations, smart defaults, and guardrails for things like accuracy, change fees, and fare rules.\n\n Make real-time data accessible. Expose real-time availability, pricing, ancillaries, loyalty profiles and balances, and payments via secure, permissioned APIs that an AI agent can discover.&quot;,

These systems may model mergers, simulate supply chain disruptions, and forecast policy impacts faster than human teams can aggregate the data.\n\nTo make that shift, enterprises will need to embed three design principles at the core of their AI programs: [...] As enterprises move from predictive and generative to agentic AI, the stakes are changing. Agentic AI — software systems capable of reasoning, acting, and learning autonomously — may sit at the center of critical business operations. For some, this evolution will surface new vulnerabilities. For others, it will create an entirely new source of strategic advantage.\n\nIn IDC’s FutureScape: Worldwide Agentic Artificial Intelligence 2026 Predictions, two forecasts capture this divergence clearly. [...] 1. Traceability by design. Every autonomous decision should carry a data lineage record and confidence score, allowing oversight without throttling performance.\n2. Integrated governance. AI ethics, risk, and compliance functions should be unified and integrated, and applied across the development and operations lifecycle.\n3. Accountability loops.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI isn’t just smarter automation—it provides a strategic blueprint for enterprises to achieve cost efficiency, drive revenue growth, and unlock the full potential of their talent.\n While autonomy delivers major benefits, its complexity demands a pragmatic, coordinated evolution of strategy, technology, data, workforce, governance, and change management. [...] Agentic AI capabilities span a spectrum of autonomy, from basic task automation to highly independent agents capable of complex, end-to-end processes. This progression offers opportunities to create new efficiencies, drive innovation, and transform business operations. To realize the full potential of the agentic enterprise, business leaders should proactively prepare their organizations to navigate and scale across these different levels of autonomous AI.\n\n Share\n\nSkip to description) [...] Agentic AI isn’t just the next wave of automation—it’s the operating logic of tomorrow’s enterprise. Organizations that embrace it by 2028 will likely save costs, release products faster, and redeploy talent to higher‑value work. Learn how to build an agentic enterprise through autonomous AI.\n\nExplore the future\n\n# Key takeaways about the agentic enterprise&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Compared with generative AI models, which respond to direct prompts, agentic AI systems can interpret complex objectives, break them down into actionable steps, leverage external tools and self-correct their course as needed. They can navigate intricate enterprise systems, initiate workflows and make informed decisions, often with minimal or no human intervention. [...] Dramatic productivity surges. Agentic AI systems can manage complex workflows that previously required numerous handoffs. In the supply chain, for example, a network of agents can help forecast demand, monitor inventory, negotiate supplier contracts and optimize logistics. [...] Next-level customer engagement. Agentic AI transforms customer service from a reactive function to a proactive one. AI agents can anticipate needs, pre-empt potential issues and offer contextually relevant solutions.\n Accelerated innovation cycles. From synthesizing research to rapid prototyping, agentic systems enable new cycles of experimentation. They free human talent to focus on complex problem-solving and ideation, significantly reducing time-to-value for innovation initiatives.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Deze gezamenlijke inspanningen kunnen ook een registratiesysteem voor agents omvatten. Net als HCM-software (human capital management) of een HRIS (Human Resources Information System), kan een registratiesysteem organisaties helpen bij het beheren van interne en externe agenten, van onboarding tot monitoring tot naleving. Dit wordt steeds belangrijker naarmate er meer agents aan het bedrijf worden toegevoegd.\n\n## Een pad in kaart brengen om te gedijen met agentic AI [...] # Definitie van technologie in 2025 — AI-agents\n\nA man and a woman stand in front of a window at dusk\nA man and a woman stand in front of a window at dusk\n\nHoewel HR AI langzaamaan steeds meer gebruikt en de resultaten wisselend zijn, zien wereldwijde leidinggevenden AI als de belangrijkste zakelijke prioriteit en de grootste kans op waarde in 2025. Agentic AI transformeert bedrijfssystemen, processen en het personeelsbestand, en HR-leiders die zich niet voorbereiden, zullen achterblijven. [...] Dit is het Jaar van Agentic AI — en omdat HR al vroeg succes laat zien, ziet de toekomst van werk er beter uit dan ooit. Leidinggevenden denken dat AI en automatisering dit jaar de grootste impact zullen hebben op kostenoptimalisatie, dus gesprekken over kosten en efficiëntie kunnen helpen bij het veiligstellen van buy-in voor medewerkers. Maar het grootste rendement komt voort uit het in staat stellen van mensen om meer impactvol werk te doen.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Because these AI teams often operate across different tools and systems, organizations need solutions that are secure and enterprise-ready. With Microsoft technologies, agentic systems are built with the security, compliance, and reliability businesses expect. For a deeper dive on multi-agentic AI, read “Designing Multi-Agent Intelligence” on Microsoft Dev Blogs. [...] Their solution brings together multiple agents for customer triage, FAQ handling, account management, product recommendations, and compliance checks. Built on Microsoft’s Agentic AI framework and integrated with Microsoft Copilot Studio and Foundry Agent Service, the system is easy to deploy and scale.\n\nThe payoff:\n\n Richer, multimodal customer experiences\n Scalable automation across channels\n Real-time personalization with memory and context [...] Incident response times plummeted from 30 minutes to just 30 seconds.\n The cost per incident dropped from $15 to less than $1.\n MSPs can now scale their services without scaling their teams.\n\nContraforce’s story is a testament to how agentic AI can transform security operations from reactive to proactive, delivering speed, scale, and cost-efficiency.\n\n### 3.

[...] On the software provider side, Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise software applications in 2026 will include agentic AI, up from less than 5% today. And agentic AI could drive approximately 30% of enterprise application software revenue by 2035, surpassing $450 billion, up from 2% in 2025. In fact, business users might not have to interact directly with the business applications at all since AI agent ecosystems will carry out user instructions across multiple applications and business [...] AI agents are set to change the dynamic between enterprises and software vendors in other ways, too.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A critical aspect of agentic AI that is being overlooked by many organisations is the advent of the hybrid AI-human workforce. This will present challenges for workforce models but only a third (32%) of global respondents say their HR team is developing strategies for managing such environments. At the same time, this does indicate that companies are beginning to think strategically about the longer-term possibilities and workforce implications of the technology. [...] Irish organisations have a broadly positive view of agentic AI and citizen development with a majority of respondents saying their organisations are encouraging or at least permitting employees to develop AI agents. More than one third (34%) of respondents say their organisation actively encourages it while 14% permit it under specific conditions or use cases. For a further 17%, policies vary by department. Only 34% of respondents said their organisations prohibit its use. [...] The emergence of agentic AI with all of its implications for risk and workforce organisation highlights the need for responsible AI to evolve in step with technology and workplace behaviours. Defined frameworks, proactive oversight and strong leadership understanding are critical if organisations want to realise the tangible bottom-line benefits of responsible AI.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Announcing Our Evaluation Of The Agent Control Plane ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The choice of agentic AI technology for enterprise leaders is best understood as an ecosystem of tech vendors that align with three functional planes, based on the need to: 1) build agents; 2) embed them into business workflows; and 3) manage and govern them at scale. These needs represent functional planes rather than strict layers in a “stack,” since vendors often span these or blur the boundaries between them. Even so, enterprises must treat them as distinct problem spaces to design coherent [...] ## Introducing Forrester’s Agent Control Plane Research Stream\n\nAn agent control plane is an enterprise control plane that inventories, governs, orchestrates, and assures heterogeneous AI agents across vendors and domains. It plays a role similar to a control plane in cloud or network architectures, sitting above the underlying systems to provide unified oversight and intervention. Key features include (but aren’t limited to): [...] Singapore’s “FEAT” principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency — require AI systems to be subject to independent oversight, audit trails, and accountable human decision-making. In each case, the governance mechanism sits separate from the runtime environment because that separation is what maintains trust and operational reliability as systems scale. Agents introduce similar and often greater complexity. As interoperability standards solidify, agents from diverse&quot;,

Both of these moves are treating software as a cost center and AI as a strategic weapon, without recognizing that AI systems [...] She noted that although the bill mandates comprehensive assessments of “software paid for, in use, or deployed,” it neglects critical facets of today’s AI software landscape. “It never defines how you access an AI agent that writes its own code, a foundation model trained on proprietary data, or an API that charges per token instead of per seat,” she said. “Instead of oversight, the bill would unlock chaos, potentially creating a compliance framework where CIOs could be punished for buying too&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Agent governance platform: As organizations deploy multiple agents across domains—customer service, finance, operations, legal, HR, etc.—we are finding there is a growing need for centralized agent governance. This layer is not just a technical construct; it is a strategic capability that we must design, implement, and operate. Its responsibilities include managing how agents interact with each other and with human users, policy definition and enforcement, monitoring and observability of agent [...] Agents mark a transformational shift in human-computer interaction. This profound change requires us in IT to play a central role in supporting our employees as they adapt and rethink their daily work with agents. Effective change management is therefore a critical responsibility for us—it’s enabling us to move beyond technology deployment to actively guiding our employees, business units, and leaders through this transition to agent-driven workflows. [...] 2. Human-led agents: The second pattern introduces autonomous agents as “digital workers” who perform specific tasks under human direction. Here, agents join teams and execute actions independently, allowing employees to delegate routine work and focus on higher-value activities.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;A critical aspect of agentic AI that is being overlooked by many organisations is the advent of the hybrid AI-human workforce. This will present challenges for workforce models but only a third (32%) of global respondents say their HR team is developing strategies for managing such environments. At the same time, this does indicate that companies are beginning to think strategically about the longer-term possibilities and workforce implications of the technology. [...] Irish organisations have a broadly positive view of agentic AI and citizen development with a majority of respondents saying their organisations are encouraging or at least permitting employees to develop AI agents. More than one third (34%) of respondents say their organisation actively encourages it while 14% permit it under specific conditions or use cases. For a further 17%, policies vary by department. Only 34% of respondents said their organisations prohibit its use. [...] The emergence of agentic AI with all of its implications for risk and workforce organisation highlights the need for responsible AI to evolve in step with technology and workplace behaviours. Defined frameworks, proactive oversight and strong leadership understanding are critical if organisations want to realise the tangible bottom-line benefits of responsible AI.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The first component is a steering file called POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual for the AI agent. It tells the agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions. [...] Developers have grown increasingly vocal about this issue. Many complain that they don&#x27;t want to burn through their token allocations just to have an AI agent figure out which tools are relevant to a specific task. They want to get to their workflow instantly — not watch an overloaded agent struggle to sort through irrelevant context. [...] Singh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts, and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.&quot;,

Futurum Group sees NetSuite Next as an \&quot;AI execution fabric\&quot; rather than a conversational layer — intelligence that runs deep in workflows instead of sitting on the surface.\n\nFor midmarket enterprises navigating talent shortages, complex compliance frameworks, and competition from digital-native companies, the distinction between advice and execution matters economically. [...] In addition, updates to SuiteCloud Platform — an extensibility and customization environment — help organizations adapt NetSuite to their unique business needs. Built on open standards, it lets enterprises mix and match AI models for different functions. SuiteAgent frameworks enable partners to build specialized automation directly into NetSuite. AI Studios give administrators control over how AI operates within specific industry needs.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“We decided to call them AI coworkers, and we set up an AI staffing team co-owned between my technology team and our chief people officer and her HR team,” he says. “That team is responsible for hiring AI coworkers and bringing them into the organization.” You heard that right: “hiring.”\n\nThe first step is to sit down with the business leader and write a job description, which is fed to the AI agent, and then it becomes known as an intern. [...] Another aspect of the agentic economy is instead of a human employee talking to a vendor’s AI agent, a company agent can handle the conversation on the employee’s behalf. And if a company wants to switch vendors, the experience will be seamless for employees, since they never had to deal directly with the vendor anyway. [...] According to a National Research Group survey of more than 3,000 senior leaders, more than half of executives say their organization is already using AI agents. Of the companies that spend no less than half their AI budget on AI agents, 88% say they’re already seeing ROI on at least one use case, with top areas being customer service and experience, marketing, cybersecurity, and software development.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The exhibit is a grid of proportional area charts displaying US employee sentiment toward gen AI by age group.

The columns represent age groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. The data is presented as percentages of respondents who agreed with each [...] employees are three times more likely to be using gen AI today than their leaders expect (4 percent of C-suite respondents estimate that employees are currently using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks, while 13 percent of employees self-report they are currently doing so). For the C-suite, 16 percent expect employees to start using gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within less than a year, 56 percent anticipate such adoption within 1-5 years, 11 percent [...] The exhibit further illustrates employees’ comfort levels with using gen AI results, belief in the net benefits of gen AI within the next five years, and plans to utilize gen AI more in their personal lives. In the Doomer archetype, 47 percent say they are comfortable using gen AI results, 54 percent believe in gen AI’s net benefit within the next five years, and 49 percent plan increased personal use of gen AI. The Gloomer archetype shows markedly higher percentages in these three areas: 79&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 - McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Chapter 3 looks at the need for speed and safety in AI deployment. While leaders and employees want to move faster, trust and safety are top concerns. About half of employees worry about AI inaccuracy and cybersecurity risks. That said, employees express greater confidence that their own companies, versus other organizations, will get AI right. The onus is on business leaders to prove them right, by making bold and responsible decisions. [...] Our research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in Superagency. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI [...] Chapter 5 looks at what is required for leaders to set their teams up for success with AI. The challenge of AI in the workplace is not a technology challenge. It is a business challenge that calls upon leaders to align teams, address AI headwinds, and rewire their companies for change.&quot;,

The need for speed and smart risk-taking is more pressing than ever as companies navigate the uncertainty of geopolitical shifts, regulatory change, and the latest advances in technology. [...] Why is that? Until recently, business leaders either didn’t see the potential ROI or they feared unintended consequences of disrupting R&amp;C functions. But that’s changing, as emerging use cases for transforming these processes point to substantial opportunities for savings and growth hiding in plain sight. Fueling this shift is a growing openness among regulators toward the responsible use of AI.

If I hire the best guy in AI and then override everything he does, then I’m just a tyrant. And I’ll probably lose that talent.” [...] He likes to stay curious and humble.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Think of a call center or store environment. You generate an agentic customer, and you say, “This is a type of call. This is a type of customer. Record an interaction.” It’s not only simulating a real phone call. You’re also getting live, detailed scoring of how you, as a frontline employee, are doing in that interaction. Are you using the right words? Have you remembered every single step of the process? It gives you very detailed coaching instructions.&quot;,
