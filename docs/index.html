<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Establishes New Benchmark for Agentic Sales Qualification (Dec 11, 2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/12/11/dynamics-365-sets-the-bar-for-agentic-sales-qualification-on-new-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a><br><p>Microsoft released groundbreaking benchmarks for agentic sales qualification in Dynamics 365, demonstrating robust performance in autonomous lead qualification and sales pipeline management. These benchmarks reinforce Microsoft’s leadership in embedding measurable, production-grade agentic AI within enterprise workflows, raising expectations for all HR and finance SaaS providers—including Workday. <br/><br/>For clients and Deloitte’s Workday practice, this raises the bar for what constitutes baseline automation and underscores the need for acceleration in agentic workflow deployment, maturity, and client enablement. Clear messaging around Workday’s governance and integration strengths is increasingly essential as clients consider broader enterprise automation strategies.</p></li>
<li><strong>Google Launches Deepest AI Research Agent Yet, Raising the Bar for SaaS AI (Dec 11, 2025):</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/google-launched-its-deepest-ai-research-agent-yet-on-the-same-day-openai-dropped-gpt-5-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full story</a><br><p>Google’s announcement of its most advanced AI research agent raises competitive stakes for SaaS providers by introducing new standards in multitask orchestration, reliability, and integration depth. Workday and partners must now address both the technical and adoption implications of this shift as clients look for seamless, explainable agent integration across business functions.<br/><br/>For Deloitte teams, this highlights the importance of cross-functional enablement and readiness to translate technical advances into practical, governed agentic workflows.</p></li>
<li><strong>SAP Offers Major Discounts to Government Customers Amid Federal Push to Modernize IT (Dec 11, 2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/acquisition/2025/12/sap-offers-major-discount-government-customers-through-onegov-agreement/409851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a><br><p>SAP’s aggressive OneGov pricing initiative directly targets public sector cloud and AI deployments, representing a competitive shift likely to impact large-scale government IT modernization contracts. This move serves as a call-to-action for Deloitte’s Workday teams to develop sector-specific playbooks and respond creatively to RFPs, emphasizing Workday’s unique strengths around AI governance and extensibility.</p></li>

<li><strong>SAP:</strong> Announced significant government sector discounts to accelerate cloud and AI adoption. <br><em>Implication:</em> Creates immediate public sector risk for Workday; Deloitte teams must develop differentiated responses for procurement scenarios. <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/acquisition/2025/12/sap-offers-major-discount-government-customers-through-onegov-agreement/409851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Read more)</a></li>

Organizations must stay vigilant on responsible adoption and competitive differentiation.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft Dynamics 365 Establishes New Benchmark for Agentic Sales Qualification (Dec 11, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft released new benchmark results for agentic sales qualification in Dynamics 365, underscoring its progress in autonomous process orchestration for business users. The update details how Dynamics 365 leverages sophisticated AI agents to autonomously qualify leads, drive pipeline efficiency, and surface insights in real-time. This move positions Microsoft as a key innovator in agent-powered business solutions and directly competes with Workday’s growing ambitions around autonomous HR and finance agents. As more SaaS players standardize around embedded agentic AI, the definition of baseline functionality is rapidly shifting.\\n\\nFor Workday clients and Deloitte’s practice, this highlights the need to both accelerate agent deployments and clearly articulate differentiators in Workday’s AI governance, workflow integration, and domain-aligned intelligence. Clients may increasingly expect agent-driven automation not just in talent processes but across all business functions, requiring redefined KPIs and enablement for new workflows. Deloitte teams should closely monitor these benchmarks to advise clients on parity, gaps, and transformation trajectories.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s focus on measurable, production-ready agentic capabilities suggests that clients will seek outcome-driven, not pilot-stage, automation in HR and adjacent enterprise domains. Workday clients must therefore address both the technical feasibility and change management implications of scaling agentic workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/12/11/dynamics-365-sets-the-bar-for-agentic-sales-qualification-on-new-benchmark\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Google Launches Deepest AI Research Agent Yet, Raising the Bar for SaaS AI (Dec 11, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On December 11, Google announced the launch of its most advanced AI research agent to date, coinciding with OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 release. The agent sets a new standard in multitask reasoning and autonomous orchestration, designed for enterprise and scientific workloads. Google’s move is not only headline-grabbing; it substantively raises industry expectations for agentic capabilities—including reliability, transparency, and integration depth—that customers now expect from SaaS solutions like Workday.\\n\\nThis intensifies competitive pressure on Workday and its ecosystem partners to advance beyond first-generation AI agents. The Google release highlights the evolution of AI agents from narrowly scoped workflows toward generalized, self-improving, and deeply integrated systems. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this reinforces the urgency of building cross-functional expertise in agentic orchestration and in deploying organizational safeguards that ensure reliable, bias-mitigated outcomes in enterprise contexts. Clients who follow Google’s trajectory may accelerate their own demands around automation, explainability, and agent orchestration across HR and financial processes.\\n\\nAcross multiple analyst and vendor viewpoints, the bar for “enterprise readiness” is now directly connected to advances in fundamental AI research, further raising the need for rigorous benchmarking when advising clients on platform selection and transformation roadmaps.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/google-launched-its-deepest-ai-research-agent-yet-on-the-same-day-openai-dropped-gpt-5-2\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP Offers Major Discounts to Government Customers Amid Federal Push to Modernize IT (Dec 11, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP has initiated a significant discount program through its OneGov agreement to accelerate federal government adoption of its cloud solutions, with special emphasis on AI, security, and agentic automation capabilities. This effort, announced on December 11, highlights SAP&#x27;s aggressive market play for public sector transformation in HR and finance, potentially diverting attention and resources from SaaS competitors like Workday in large-scale government IT projects.\\n\\nThis competitive move signals a broader trend among incumbents: leveraging financial incentives to rapidly increase deployment of AI-powered platforms in regulated, high-impact sectors. For Workday clients and Deloitte, the SAP offer is a clear warning that winning transformation deals will require not only leading-edge technology but also creative commercial strategies and rapid, compliant deployment frameworks. Deloitte practitioners must help clients assess total cost of ownership—not just functional parity—and develop sector-specific playbooks to respond to similar market maneuvers.\\n\\nGiven that government and public sector business often serves as a bellwether for SaaS adoption in risk-sensitive environments, Workday must proactively reinforce the value of its responsible AI approach, rapid scalability, and robust cloud security to remain a preferred choice.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.nextgov.com/acquisition/2025/12/sap-offers-major-discount-government-customers-through-onegov-agreement/409851\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Released new benchmarking for AI-powered agentic sales processes within Dynamics 365, demonstrating measurable impact on pipeline automation and sales efficiency.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft’s advances set new industry norms for agentic workflow scalability and business outcome focus. Workday and Deloitte must respond with clear demonstrations of agent-led automation in HR and finance as clients recalibrate expectations toward enterprise-wide, production-grade agents. This may require acceleration of Workday’s beta-to-production cycles and storytelling around governance, responsible deployment, and industry benchmarks.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Google\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched its most advanced AI research agent yet, capable of generalizable multitask orchestration, aiming at enterprise-grade deployments.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Google’s research-driven leap means leading SaaS platforms face new technical and trust standards in agentic AI.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In an AI-driven world, intelligent tools and agents can help companies find new customers, understand their needs, guide sales, suggest relevant add-ons, and automate renewals. With all these elements in sync, the racetrack becomes a true growth engine. [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships. [...] Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different.&quot;,

You give it an objective (“Reduce churn in the under-30 demographic” or “Rebalance this portfolio for tax efficiency”), and it formulates a plan, executes steps, and reports back.\n\nThe Adoption Curve is Vertical:\n\nIf you are a mid-sized bank or insurer, you cannot out-spend the global giants. But you can out-maneuver them by deploying agents in following three specific targeted zones: [...] ### 1. Governance First (The “Trust” Moat)\n\nIn 2026, “AI Accountability” is the new regulatory buzzword. You must deploy governance-first architectures. This means every AI agent must have a human-in-the-loop escalation path and a fully auditable log of why it made a decision (e.g., denied a loan or flagged a claim). Trust is your most important product.\n\n### 2. Augmentation, Not Replacement&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While there is much debate about how users will get money back from investing in AI agents, the stakes are also high when it comes to how they pay for them. Gartner has forecast that agentic AI could drive around 30 percent of enterprise application software revenue by 2035, surpassing $450 billion, up from 2 percent in 2025.\n\nVendors supporting the pillars of enterprise for most large organizations – names like SAP, Oracle, Workday, and Infor – all see AI agents as a big part of their plans. [...] In the near term, vendors will continue to use a range of commercial models for AI agents, she said. Hybrid models will include a flat fee plus usage-based pricing on actions or workflows. \&quot;Copilots will continue as seat-based since their usage is tied to humans and generally use is predictable. Workflow automation agents will migrate to pricing based on usage or outputs or outcomes,\&quot; she said. [...] \&quot;Users can ensure they share the gains through outcome-based pricing where the vendor and the customer share in the productivity gains, revenue uplift, and so on. This pricing model will require a great deal of information sharing to track the gains and attribute them to the agentic/agent offering. Transparency and a great deal of trust will be required on both sides,\&quot; Singer said.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Building Awareness and Excitement: The first crucial step is creating a foundation of understanding and enthusiasm for AI within your organization. Workday took a deliberate approach by rolling out a series of readily available AI features. These features were seamlessly integrated into the tools employees use daily, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. [...] The goal was to make AI intuitive and \&quot;non-regrettable,\&quot; meaning employees could experiment without fear of negative consequences. This approach empowers employees to immediately discover ways to incorporate AI tools into their daily routines, generating excitement and demystifying the technology. [...] For example, chatbots in legal or HR contexts must be equipped to detect nuances like tone, toxicity, and bias. Determining the right use cases becomes a critical priority. Workday addressed this by conducting a thorough analysis of its operational landscape, collaborating closely with internal functions to map existing resources and identify potential AI integration opportunities. This close partnership with business teams continues throughout the development lifecycle of functional AI tools.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When automation and AI operate in tandem, governance shifts from reactive control to continuous assurance. Policy rules execute the moment data lands, while learning algorithms observe usage patterns and fine-tune safeguards in the background. Quality checks, lineage updates, and access rights automatically sync so analysts can focus on insights instead of validation. [...] By integrating AI-driven insights into your governance engine, you create a system that not only enforces rules but anticipates issues, continuously refines controls, and empowers your team to focus on strategy rather than data maintenance.\n\n&gt; Gartner predicts that without a catalyst for modernization, 80% of data governance strategies will fail by 2027.\n\n## Solutions for a Strong Governance Foundation [...] While automation rapidly executes across governance pillars, it still runs on fixed rules.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As AI technologies become increasingly pervasive and sophisticated, so does the need for specialized governance. AI governance refers to a set of policies, processes and tools designed to ensure that AI systems behave ethically, reliably and in compliance with regulations. It also includes overseeing the development, deployment and operation of AI models to prevent biases, ensure transparency and maintain explainability. [...] •    Risk management: Both data and AI governance contribute to overall risk management strategies. Data governance mitigates risks associated with data breaches or misuse. AI governance addresses risks linked to biased or opaque AI decisions, which can lead to model hallucinations. [...] •    Transparency and explainability: AI governance mandates transparency in AI decision-making processes. For this, AI models must be explainable, which depends heavily on the quality and traceability of input data, which is covered by data governance. Moreover, AI decisions depend on data lineage. Knowing where data comes from, how it has been used and who has access is critical for auditing AI outcomes.&quot;,

But jour ouvrable suivant = next business day. I thik business day is mostly used for commerce and finance.   \n   \n Now - as already suggested - there is a difference to be made between jour ouvré and jour ouvrable.   \n   \n As found in the GDT, under jour ouvrable  \n&gt; Définition :  \n&gt;  Jour de la semaine qui est normalement consacré au travail ou aux activités professionnelles et qui n&#x27;est pas un jour férié.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents offers you the ability to build and configure autonomous agents in your application. An agent helps your end-users complete actions based on organization data and user input. Agents orchestrate interactions between foundation models (FMs), data sources, software applications, and user conversations. In addition, agents automatically call APIs to take actions and invoke knowledge bases to supplement information for these actions. By integrating agents, you can accelerate [...] With agents, you can automate tasks for your customers and answer questions for them. For example, you can create an agent that helps customers process insurance claims or an agent that helps customers make travel reservations.

The agent also invokes the FM to generate responses and follow-up steps in its process.\n Instructions – You write instructions that describe what the agent is designed to do. With advanced prompts, you can further customize instructions for the agent at every step of orchestration and include Lambda functions to parse each step&#x27;s output. [...] + Action groups – You define the actions that the agent should perform for the user (through providing the following resources):\n\n    - One of the following schemas to define the parameters that the agent needs to elicit from the user (each action group can use a different schema):&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships.&quot;,

[...] Government agencies and worker advocates have expressed concerns that AI tools can discriminate against job applicants when they are built using data that reflects existing biases.\n\nThe EEOC has warned employers that they can be held legally liable if they fail to prevent screening software from having a discriminatory impact. [...] \&quot;Mobley has plausibly alleged that Workday’s algorithmic tools perform precisely the same screening and referral functions as traditional employment agencies — albeit by more sophisticated means,\&quot; EEOC lawyers wrote in the brief.\n\nThe commission did not take a position on the merits of Mobley&#x27;s claims.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI bias can stem from flawed data, algorithmic design and human judgment, leading to outcomes that may perpetuate societal inequalities.\n Mitigating AI bias requires a human-centric approach: conducting data audits, re-evaluating algorithms and grounding decisions in societal contexts.\n Long-term solutions include continuous monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration, and aligning AI outcomes with ethical principles and societal wellbeing. [...] #### Understanding and mitigating bias in AI systems is critical to fostering fairness, promoting responsible AI practices and driving equitable societal outcomes.\n\n##### In brief [...] Bias in AI systems poses serious challenges that can lead to unfair treatment and systemic discrimination. To combat these issues, organizations must implement strategies like data audits and algorithm testing, while fostering collaboration and public awareness. Recognizing the implications for individuals and society, identifying types of bias, and developing strategies for monitoring and mitigating bias are essential for creating fairer and more responsible AI systems.\n\nAbout this article&quot;,

Workday, Inc.).\n\nThe individual and other opt-in plaintiffs said they received hundreds of quick rejections from roles advertised through Workday, including some during hours at which it would be unlikely for people to be working. [...] Workday previously told the court it could not be liable for discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because it was functioning as a vendor, not an employer.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and courts are beginning to examine whether AI-driven hiring tools unintentionally discriminate against protected groups, and a recent case, Mobley v.

Even a well-calibrated model can drift as data or hiring practices evolve.\n\n### The bottom line [...] In that lawsuit, a plaintiff alleged that Workday’s applicant-screening algorithms disproportionately exclude workers over 40, and a California court has conditionally certified a collective action against the company. If successful, the case could shift liability from individual employers to the vendors that build and operate AI tools.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The numbers above illustrate a clear gap. While people may be open to using AI, many struggle to use it effortlessly and effectively. Closing this gap requires more than new digital tools and more advanced AI. You need simple processes, smooth interactions, and a strong foundation of trust.\n\n## AI and CX are the future [...] Our CX survey found that while many companies turn to AI for internal tasks such as design, automated testing, and talent acquisition, only about 45% use it to manage CX-related tasks spread across the racetrack. In addition to marketing and sales components, this includes using AI for customer service and support through chatbots and virtual assistants. [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;While there is much debate about how users will get money back from investing in AI agents, the stakes are also high when it comes to how they pay for them.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit [...] Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit [...] Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships.&quot;,

[...] \&quot;The ledger never lies, and in 2024, it screamed &#x27;automate or stagnate.&#x27; AI and the cloud weren&#x27;t just features; they were the oxygen of B2B finance, breathing life into efficiency and driving a Darwinian selection where only the most agile and digitally savvy survived. Embedded finance blurred the lines, and real time wasn&#x27;t a luxury; it became essential to a truly connected financial ecosystem.\&quot; — Kevin Permenter, senior research director, Financial Applications\n\n## Coverage&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit [...] Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] Addressing this challenge requires an integrated business and IT framework capable of delivering personalized customer journeys, advanced audience segmentation, and unified data. The framework also should provide a 360-degree customer view, real-time engagement, cross-channel marketing, and AI-enabled insights. By connecting marketing, sales, service, and loyalty, your business can build trust and win long-term customer engagement.\n\n## Map the modern customer journey with AI&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit [...] Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] As you dive deeper into AI, it’s important to avoid the temptation to simply automate tasks without rethinking and reinventing processes. While automation can trim costs and drive efficiency, it can’t solve the range of CX challenges by itself. The real value of AI lies in smarter and better insights, anticipating customer needs, streamlining the buying process, and expanding relationships.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How AI and data reinvent customer experience and revenue&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Companies that put data at the center of relationships can build loyalty through trust. They reimagine workflows and automate renewals, shifting the emphasis from efficiency and cost-cutting to growth. In this framework, AI emerges as a true CX accelerator. Enduring connections, happier customers, and sustained business growth follow.\n\nThere’s one last element, however. Realizing the full potential of AI means meeting customers on their terms. Everyone’s comfort level with AI is different. [...] Addressing this challenge requires an integrated business and IT framework capable of delivering personalized customer journeys, advanced audience segmentation, and unified data. The framework also should provide a 360-degree customer view, real-time engagement, cross-channel marketing, and AI-enabled insights. By connecting marketing, sales, service, and loyalty, your business can build trust and win long-term customer engagement.\n\n## Map the modern customer journey with AI [...] When you create frictionless experiences, your customers spend less time dealing with tedious and unnecessary interactions—and your enterprise evolves from reactive to proactive. AI allows you to better anticipate consumer desires and sentiment, and it also can change the way your company promotes and sells products. You might, for example, find it’s suddenly possible to connect related items from catalogs and websites and build dynamic bundling and pricing models that can fuel higher profit&quot;,

[...] \&quot;The ledger never lies, and in 2024, it screamed &#x27;automate or stagnate.&#x27; AI and the cloud weren&#x27;t just features; they were the oxygen of B2B finance, breathing life into efficiency and driving a Darwinian selection where only the most agile and digitally savvy survived. Embedded finance blurred the lines, and real time wasn&#x27;t a luxury; it became essential to a truly connected financial ecosystem.\&quot; — Kevin Permenter, senior research director, Financial Applications\n\n## Coverage&quot;,

Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are under pressure to fix that without disrupting business continuity.\n\nThe new agentic AI tools and application-intelligence solutions change the economics and speed of modernization. Because of this approach, CIOs must consider when to pick each path, how to prioritize across a portfolio and what success looks like in practice. [...] The advent of agentic AI execution (such as AWS Transform for .NET) changes the cost-time calculus of large rework. These services analyze code repositories, propose refactors, automatically convert patterns to cross-platform .NET and support parallel execution across multiple applications. This process increases throughput and repeatability. [...] Tools like CAST provide deep, automated discovery (such as architecture mapping, dependency graphs or technical debt scoring) that converts unknown unknowns into a quantified backlog. This method enables evidence-based bids, realistic schedules and measurable risk reduction. CAST software can compress portfolio discovery from months to days when applied at scale.

This blog will look at how this is developing.\n\n## See how agentic AI can help your brand [...] Agentic personalization combines conversational intelligence from LLMs with semantic models for cold-start coverage and DLPR models for optimization.  \nThis orchestration ensures that every output isn’t just linguistically fluent but also contextually relevant, brand-safe and revenue-aligned. [...] As AI, data, and experience come together, the brands that lead will be those that recognize intent as it is expressed — through searches, conversations, and interactions , and use that understanding to guide each moment with contextual content.\n\nThe future of personalization belongs to experiences that understand intent — and elevate every moment because of it.\n\n## A new era of personalization&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Why AI agents still outrun the reality of enterprise ambition&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“These are the signs of initiatives in their infancy,” Bertrand said. “We’re still putting the foundations in place, and we’re years from where we want to be.”\n\nThe cultural dimension is equally critical. Human resources is increasingly involved in shaping how enterprises integrate AI agents as digital coworkers rather than as replacements for human workers. This shift reframes agentic AI as workforce evolution rather than pure automation. [...] Image 27: The slide shows a score of 4.1 out of 5 (71 percent) view the rise of digital labor as inevitable, with a score of 3.1 (64 percent) prioritizing knowledge work over task automation and 1.8 (eight percent) have shared cross-business leadership accountability, demonstrating why the ambition of AI agents outpaces enterprise reality.\nThe Digital Labor Transformation Futures Index — theCUBE Research\n\n### The execution deficit behind agentic AI [...] No single failure drives that gap. Many organizations still treat agentic AI and digital coworkers as technical implementations owned by IT rather than as workforce transformation initiatives that demand shared accountability. Strategy scores show that investment and planning are underway, but execution scores reveal that the collaborative structures, governance and change management required to operationalize digital labor at scale remain immature.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI-powered recruitment tools are transforming hiring processes, but they have faced scrutiny for perpetuating biases present in historical data, leading to a projected rise in AI bias audits. Using agentic AI, or AI agents, to make complex hiring decisions carries an especially high risk.\n\nA variety of federal laws prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of: [...] As AI increasingly takes over high-volume, repetitive tasks in talent acquisition, HR is poised to demonstrate its value in terms of human insight and influence, particularly in meeting current market challenges. With traditional job posting and resume-screening methods becoming insufficient, HR must shift to designing adaptable, data-informed recruiting strategies that support future business growth by marketing the organization more effectively. This includes:\n\nTop HR leaders are: [...] The exponential rise of artificial intelligence has significantly disrupted the recruiting landscape, creating even greater challenges for 2026. AI is transforming various recruitment workflows, and its use will continue to become more prevalent, both for employees and recruiters.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The philosophy underpins what Chess calls a “glass-box” approach to enterprise AI, where decisions are visible and every agent operates within human-defined guardrails.\n\n### Built on Oracle’s foundation\n\nNetSuite Next is the result of five years of development. It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer. [...] NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.\n\n### Governance by design\n\nAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries. [...] One downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.\n\n“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The introduction of agentic AI’s intelligent, autonomous systems could offer support and help salespeople thrive in a new landscape of AI-enabled success. Beyond automation, agentic AI can embed intelligent controls and facilitate direct, dynamic interactions between teams, systems, and customers. By shifting routine oversight to AI agents, people are freed to focus on strategy, relationships, and growth, while autonomous systems proactively safeguard against errors and risks. [...] Agentic AI changes the game by integrating real-time data, enforcing policies, and automating routine tasks. Unlike traditional automation, agentic AI agents go beyond executing tasks. They interact, adapt, and monitor controls in real time, creating a more resilient and responsive TPM environment.\n\nConsider the following real-world examples and imagine how a sales force supported by agentic AI might have identified risks earlier or acted differently. [...] When building AI agents for use in sales and trade promotion management, several key prerequisites must be in place to ensure effectiveness, compliance, and value creation.\n\nIn addition to the standard data and technology requirements needed to set your AI agents up for success, the most important prerequisites include:\n\nWith these foundational elements in place, your organization will be well-positioned to unlock the full potential of agentic AI-driven trade promotion management.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“As organizations move beyond experimentation, 2026 will be the year of outcomes for AI. The focus will shift from potential to performance and real measurement of business results across operations, talent acquisition, and employee engagement. For HR leaders, this means putting rigour around AI ROI to assess how intelligent automation, predictive analytics, and personalized talent experiences directly impact retention, productivity, and growth.” – Amy Cappellanti-Wolf, Chief People Officer, [...] In the age of intelligent business, HR intelligence is becoming the new competitive currency. AI will transform workforce insights into foresight, revealing where growth will come from, where risks are emerging, and how to unlock human potential and operational excellence at scale. Organizations that connect people and performance through trusted, transparent data will be more resilient, more responsive, and better equipped to lead the next wave of innovation. [...] As companies embrace AI as a business enabler, HR will be at the centre of measuring its impact. From accelerating hiring with predictive insights to reducing attrition through data-driven workforce planning, AI will help leaders make smarter, faster, and more informed decisions. The organizations that win in 2026 won’t just deploy AI, they’ll quantify its value. HR teams that establish clear metrics for outcomes, including cost efficiency, employee engagement, and performance impact, will&quot;,

It responded with greater precision to the lead’s questions to develop purchase interest and asked pointed discovery questions to better qualify the lead before handing off to a seller.\n\nThese gains are attributable to the hard lessons we have learnt through close collaboration with customers to understand the diversity of needs on intent detection and knowledge retrieval across AI agents for Dynamics 365 Sales, Service and Contact Center applications.&quot;,

Notably, the EY data aligns with findings from Dresner Advisory Service research on agentic AI, which shows that firms with mature data processes are looking to use agentic AI broadly for transformation, rather than simply for cost reduction. The data suggests that many of the firms focused only on using AI for headcount reduction have not invested in the foundational technologies needed to take advantage of what AI offers. [...] Bottom line: AI has the capabilities to affect a major portion of the labor market. An MIT study that applied 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties found that 11.7% of the U.S. labor market could be replaced by current AI capabilities. These findings are troubling, especially for younger workers whose job experience and knowledge may not be suited to those enterprise jobs that are being augmented -- but not replaced -- by AI.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Building an enterprise-scale modernization roadmap for . ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Today, those same systems can slow down an organization’s ability to adopt AI, move to the cloud or deliver new digital experiences. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are under pressure to fix that without disrupting business continuity.\n\nThe new agentic AI tools and application-intelligence solutions change the economics and speed of modernization. Because of this approach, CIOs must consider when to pick each path, how to prioritize across a portfolio and what success looks like in practice. [...] Tools like CAST provide deep, automated discovery (such as architecture mapping, dependency graphs or technical debt scoring) that converts unknown unknowns into a quantified backlog. This method enables evidence-based bids, realistic schedules and measurable risk reduction. CAST software can compress portfolio discovery from months to days when applied at scale. This capability materially reduces initial program friction.\n\n### Agentic AI for large-scale transformation [...] The advent of agentic AI execution (such as AWS Transform for .NET) changes the cost-time calculus of large rework. These services analyze code repositories, propose refactors, automatically convert patterns to cross-platform .NET and support parallel execution across multiple applications. This process increases throughput and repeatability.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;It seems that your suspension from Co-Pilot may have been triggered by the system&#x27;s content moderation mechanisms. These systems are designed to prevent the generation of content that could be deemed inappropriate or harmful. When you were attempting to continue your story, the prompts you used might have been interpreted as violating these guidelines, leading to the temporary suspension. It&#x27;s not uncommon for AI systems to misinterpret user intent, especially if the phrasing is close to terms [...] or topics that are flagged as sensitive or inappropriate. [...] If you continue to experience issues, consider reviewing the guidelines for acceptable use or reaching out to Microsoft support for further clarification on the suspension and how to avoid it in the future.\n\n&#x27; cx=&#x27;32&#x27; cy=&#x27;32&#x27; r=&#x27;32&#x27; /%3E%3Ctext x=&#x27;50%25&#x27; y=&#x27;55%25&#x27; dominant-baseline=&#x27;middle&#x27; text-anchor=&#x27;middle&#x27; fill=&#x27;%23FFF&#x27; %3EC%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E)&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Building an enterprise-scale modernization roadmap for . ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Tools like CAST provide deep, automated discovery (such as architecture mapping, dependency graphs or technical debt scoring) that converts unknown unknowns into a quantified backlog. This method enables evidence-based bids, realistic schedules and measurable risk reduction. CAST software can compress portfolio discovery from months to days when applied at scale. This capability materially reduces initial program friction.\n\n### Agentic AI for large-scale transformation [...] Today, those same systems can slow down an organization’s ability to adopt AI, move to the cloud or deliver new digital experiences. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are under pressure to fix that without disrupting business continuity.\n\nThe new agentic AI tools and application-intelligence solutions change the economics and speed of modernization. Because of this approach, CIOs must consider when to pick each path, how to prioritize across a portfolio and what success looks like in practice. [...] The advent of agentic AI execution (such as AWS Transform for .NET) changes the cost-time calculus of large rework. These services analyze code repositories, propose refactors, automatically convert patterns to cross-platform .NET and support parallel execution across multiple applications. This process increases throughput and repeatability.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Creating a glass box: How NetSuite is engineering trust ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.\n\nIn a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust. [...] The philosophy underpins what Chess calls a “glass-box” approach to enterprise AI, where decisions are visible and every agent operates within human-defined guardrails.\n\n### Built on Oracle’s foundation\n\nNetSuite Next is the result of five years of development. It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer. [...] For Chess and Gary Wiessinger, SVP of Application Development at NetSuite, the challenge lies in governing AI responsibly. Rather than reinventing its system, NetSuite is extending the same principles into the AI era that have guided its strategy for 27 years — security, control, and auditability. The goal is to make AI actions traceable, permissions enforceable, and outcomes auditable.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;First, automation and AI are rapidly transforming the nature of operational work. Across industries, routine, repetitive tasks are increasingly being handled by intelligent systems, freeing up human talent for more-strategic roles.

The company didn’t need to make mass [...] Breaking down silos in the structure. 3, Retooling governance to enable cocreation, teamwork, and decentralized decision-making. The three leadership levers are: 1, Setting priorities ruthlessly but fluidly. 2, Moving employees quickly to where they create the most value. 3, Shifting the focus of performance management from efficiency to impact. The two value generation levers are: 1, Operational teams that act as enablers of change rather than gatekeepers. 2, Adopting an adaptive, iterative [...] But today organizations face challenges that agile frameworks were never designed to address. Entire industries are being redefined overnight. AI and advanced analytics are compressing decision cycles; customers and employees expect personalized, real-time experiences. In this new context the project-driven organization is the next logical evolution because instead of simply optimizing teams or workflows, it redesigns everything around dynamic, empowered, cross-functional teams.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The current excitement around AI agents, referred to by Deloitte as digital workers, lies in their ability to deliver profound productivity gains, according to Abdi Goodarzi (pictured, right), head of gen AI products, innovations and new businesses at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd.\n\n“The demand is really to get a lot more value and also drive the cost of work at the enterprise and take the intelligence level of the work and the way the work is executed to a whole new level,” he said. [...] As businesses grapple with the complexities of growing and scaling operations, AI-driven digital workers are rapidly becoming integral to strategies aimed at achieving significant cost reductions and higher-value outcomes. Organizations today seek technologies that enable smarter work processes without the traditional scaling costs associated with hiring additional human staff.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As agents mature within job functions, organizations will need equally mature approaches to managing them. This will likely require an entirely new framework for managing agents that not only leans on traditional human resource management concepts for areas where agents share similarities with human workers, but also diverges to account for their unique characteristics. Some areas of focus for HR, such as workplace culture, employee loyalty, and worker motivation, won’t be applicable to agents [...] This evolution represents a fundamental reimagining of what work means, how it’s performed, and who performs it. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that AI agents and human workers have different skill sets. While agents excel at defined processes, humans remain essential for navigating the shifting ground of business requirements and complex problem-solving scenarios.\n\nThis transformation creates two primary areas that human workers are moving toward. [...] The key to success lies in recognizing that agentic transformation is not about replacing humans with machines, but about creating new forms of human-AI collaboration that leverage the unique strengths of both human and silicon-based workers. The organizations that figure out how to drive this collaboration effectively will define the future of work itself.\n\n### The jagged frontier: Ethan Mollick on AI agents in the workforce\n\nImage 19&quot;,

[...] But Deloitte urges more fundamental rethinking, calling on organizations to “take risks”. These include reforming the physical structure of offices, questioning the idea of regular shifts and even reconsidering how career progression is judged.\n\nHaving a clear roadmap can make the journey out of the crisis easier.

That’s why Deloitte is a founding member along with AT&amp;T, Capital One, and Cisco of the Athena Pledge, which aims to mobilize investment, research and opportunities in the industry and to rally other brands and companies to increase investment and support for women’s sports.\n\nThe potential of women’s sports for brand and market growth is significant. It’s time to get in the game and champion a more inclusive future in sport, for all. [...] Furthermore, by gaining greater visibility for women&#x27;s sports, companies help to create new role models for girls that can encourage them to stay in sports.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;PwC surveyed more than 54,000 workers in 46 countries and territories and found workers are largely positive about AI despite the job churn it represents.\n\n\&quot;They see it as something that enables them to be more productive, to remove some of the mundane in their day-to-day work, an opportunity to develop new skills and, ultimately, an opportunity to create new job opportunities,\&quot; added Brown. [...] In the survey, more than 50% of workers chose at least one positive statement about the impact of AI on their careers, from increasing productivity to helping them gain new skills. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said: \&quot;AI will help me increase my productivity/efficiency at work.\&quot;\n\nThe majority of workers are positive about the impact of AI on their careers. Image: PwC [...] At the Forum&#x27;s Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, China, PwC presented the results of its survey in a session called The Global Workforce.\n\n\&quot;What the workers tell us is they are wanting to embrace the opportunity to upskill, to develop themselves, to be relevant, to be able to be more productive and to contribute to that reinvention of their organizations,\&quot; said Peter Brown, PwC Global People and Organization Leader.\n\nLoading...&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The gaming industry is tipped to maintain its recent rapid growth, and could be worth $321 billion by 2026, a new PwC report says.\n Millions of new players splashed out on games and consoles during COVID-19 lockdowns.\n Some players said gaming during the pandemic helped with their mental health.\n But the switch to working from home created an unexpected challenge for some companies in the industry. [...] China and the US dominated the market in 2021, accounting for about half of gaming and eSports revenues. But future growth could come from less wealthy countries with growing populations.\n\nThe PwC report predicts that the games market will expand fastest in Turkey, with average annual growth of 24.1% between 2021 and 2026. It will be followed by Pakistan, with expansion of 21.9%, and India on 18.3%.\n\n## ‘Unacceptable’ price rises [...] Nonetheless, gaming revenues are expected to continue increasing, driven by higher investment in in-app advertising, according to PwC analysts.\n\nVideo games made up just 6.1% of global spending in the entertainment and media sector in 2017, but by 2026 they are projected to grab a 10.9% share as gaming becomes even more mainstream, the PwC report says.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Nelle operazioni HR di IBM, l&#x27;azienda ha automatizzato oltre un milione di attività e ora risolve il 95 percento delle richieste di assistenza dei dipendenti senza escalation. Neil Dhar, Global Managing Partner di IBM Consulting, ha detto che quello che ne deriva è una funzione HR che può scalare con l&#x27;organizzazione. [...] Prepararsi a tali cambiamenti richiede più che strumenti. La Strategia della forza lavoro, ad esempio, rimane critico. Laura-Elizabeth Ware, SVP di North America HCM Cloud Operations di Oracle, ha sottolineato la necessità per le aziende di condurre un inventario chiaro delle competenze prima di introdurre gli agenti nei sistemi HR. Un recente studio dell&#x27;IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) conferma questa idea, rilevando che un terzo dei CEO intende riqualificare i dipendenti e la metà [...] Deutsche Telekom e altri hanno fornito esempi di progressi. Il CIO Peter Leukert ha detto che l&#x27;automazione ha ridotto i tempi di patching dell&#x27;80 percento, aggiungendo che l&#x27;approccio potrebbe mancare di fascino, ma risponde ai requisiti operativi fondamentali.\n\n## Agenti AI e forza lavoro umana&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The transition to agentic AI represents more than technological evolution—it’s an organizational transformation that is likely to reshape how enterprises operate, compete, and create value. Organizations that master the foundational elements of agent-native process design, multiagent orchestration, and silicon workforce management will be positioned to thrive in an increasingly automated business environment. [...] As agents mature within job functions, organizations will need equally mature approaches to managing them. This will likely require an entirely new framework for managing agents that not only leans on traditional human resource management concepts for areas where agents share similarities with human workers, but also diverges to account for their unique characteristics. Some areas of focus for HR, such as workplace culture, employee loyalty, and worker motivation, won’t be applicable to agents [...] “It’s hybrid by design,” she says. “With the high level of autonomy of these agents, it’s not going to substitute for people, but it’s going to change what [human workers] do today, allowing them to invest their time on more valuable work.”12&quot;,

Not the proprietary part, but have they set up an AI agent to help them with their work? How do they think about how they leverage different tools and being able to document that and show that, or a proof of build of some kind. [...] There&#x27;s some research being done by, I think it&#x27;s Michelle Miller at Harvard looking at how it&#x27;s a lot of female dominated care work and also administrative and clerical work. That&#x27;s sort of the prime target, though AI&#x27;s not the same as automation. Of course, automation is impacting a lot of human to human jobs.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Finding and Developing the Right Talent.Agentic AI requires a mix of advanced technical talent such as AI-prompt engineers, AI or machine language specialists, and data engineers as well as business translators who can map AI use cases to workflows. Most organizations underestimate this need. For example, an insurer that is setting up an AI innovation team may initially staff it with only the existing data-scientist team; however, it will quickly realize it needs domain experts who understand [...] Businesses across industries and functions are integrating agentic AI into a variety of workflows, sometimes leveraging platforms such as Salesforce’s Einstein AI and AgentForce platforms, which use predictive analytics and automation to enhance sales, marketing, and customer service workflows. In addition, ServiceNow’s AI agents and Now Assist capabilities are automating IT, HR, and operational processes, reducing manual workloads by up to 60%. Workflows that are successfully using agentic AI [...] AI agents are not just improving workflows; they’re redefining how businesses operate. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, generative AI, and autonomous systems, augmented by a proliferation of enterprise data from digital devices and collaboration tools, have dramatically increased their ability to handle complex decision making in real time. As a result, these intelligent virtual assistants are transforming core technology platforms like CRM, ERP, and HR from relatively static systems to&quot;,

At VentureBeat’s Transform 2025, Matthew Kropp, managing director and senior partner at BCG, offered a game plan for workflow evolution, employee adoption, and organizational change. [...] In a study BCG conducted with Harvard, Wharton, and MIT, they asked 750 knowledge workers to write a business and marketing plan, with and without generative AI. The participants using GPT4 executed 25% faster, completed 15% more tasks, and the quality of their output was 40% better. And when given an LLM, the bottom performers in the baseline did just as well as the top performers. [...] While these tools are fantastic, people aren’t using them. BCG tracked the adoption of GitHub Copilot and productivity metrics for an organization with about 10,000 software engineers. The top 5% engineers doubled in productivity in four months, while 60% showed zero improvement, because they just didn’t adopt the tool at all.&quot;,

Begin to flatten the pyramid, create new job ladders that reflect AI orchestration, and establish pods that include AI. Secure hard-to-find, AI-native talent early, and upskill the rest fast. HR must be embedded at the front line of transformation, shaping new paths and policies in real time.\n\n## Where to Start [...] 1 / 5\n\nOur interviews with AI-native leaders, our client experience, and job market data demonstrate that major, AI-driven shifts in work are underway. Specifically: [...] What leaders need to do now: Take a test-and-expand approach. Pilot AI in safe zones (such as ticket triage and content operations), then scale successes. Begin bridging legacy roles to AI-enhanced ones through structured rotations, internal mobility, and shadowing. Upskill teams with foundational fluency and collaborative AI usage skills. Entry-level pipelines should evolve, not disappear: elevate expectations, and support early talent with intentional development tracks.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Be human first. There needs to be absolute clarity over the role of AI, the level of human oversight, and where a person is critical to the process. This should be underpinned by corporate guidelines around the responsible use of AI, and transparency with the candidate about how and when AI is being deployed. This could include a rigorous onboarding process for any new tech tools and audits to check for bias in AI models. [...] “The opportunity is real and exciting, especially when it comes to freeing up recruiters to spend more time on relationship building and widening talent pools,” says Julie Bedard, a managing director and partner at BCG who specializes in talent strategies.\n\n“At the same time, there is an imperative on companies to ensure the candidate experience is positive. There is a business risk if candidates do not have a good experience.” [...] One of the key advantages for companies is the ability to surface new and more diverse talent pools.\n\nRecruiters traditionally source candidates from a select number of places to manage the volume of applicants. But AI allows the net to be cast much wider and helps the recruiter to screen far more candidates and find where skills match job requirements.\n\nThese changes are positive for the role of the recruiter, a job which has traditionally reported a high proportion of administrative time.&quot;,

As everyone has said the numbing agent just takes a couple of minutes and if you have an experienced person inserting the bcg it should not hurt ! I had 15 bcg and just had a uti once and no they cannot give the bcg when you have an infection so you have to wait for the course of antibiotics to leave you with a clear sample of urine before you begin again.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The study suggests that selecting the right roles for automation and AI interventions could, on average, save around 15-20% in HR labor time. According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer tool, HR business partners could save up to 15% of employee time through AI; talent acquisition teams can save up to 20%; and HR operations teams up to 35%. [...] BOSTON - November 19, 2024 -The transformative impact of generative AI on the HR profession could lead to a more human touch, in addition to lower costs, according to a new study by global consultancy Bain &amp; Company. [...] “HR is at a critical juncture. The function is under pressure to become both more cost efficient and more strategic. That is a challenging balance to strike,” said John Hazan, a partner at Bain &amp; Company and global head of the firm’s Talent solution. “Generative AI has the power to elevate HR’s role in the organization, from transactional operators to strategic advisers. Our analysis suggests a typical company could save, on average, up to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For HR, agentic AI is not merely a technology upgrade—it requires a fundamental reimagining of the function’s role. Agentic AI has potential to reshape work itself, blurring the line between human and digital labor into “hybrid” co-intelligent teams and calling for a rethink of the entire “talent” system. HR leaders are uniquely positioned to architect this future while safeguarding human experience, embedding AI deeply into workforce strategy and operations and navigating the human choices [...] To unlock the full potential of agentic AI, HR should be an architect of the workforce transformation ahead and rethink talent acquisition, development, management, and engagement. Success will depend on clarity, transparency, and trust: defining which tasks are delegated to agents, establishing critical guardrails for data ethics and privacy, and ensuring every AI decision reinforces human values. [...] Organizational design: Future-ready structures will balance speed and accountability, integrating purposeful trade-offs between human and digital labor to maximize value while preserving human judgment and responsibility. Structures should go beyond traditional boxes and lines to focus on outcomes and delivering impact. Agentic AI has potential to enable advanced capabilities—such as scenario modeling, workforce insights, and culture monitoring—allowing HR to partner with other business&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Enter generative AI. Paradoxically, the technology can help HR professionals have a more human touch—and at a lower cost than ever before. By enabling drastic efficiency in transactional tasks, it frees up HR professionals to refocus on their expertise and play a more strategic role. In fact, Bain analysis shows that companies can save an average of 15% to 20% in HR labor time through AI automation and augmentation. [...] According to Bain’s Generative AI Workforce Impact Explorer, automating or augmenting select HR tasks can save more time than others. Certain tasks consume a disproportionate share of HR capacity, offering a roadmap for AI investment. For example, HR operations tasks, which tend to be more transactional in nature, are prime candidates, as AI can save around 25% or more in employee time _(see below)_.\n\n#### Overall estimated HR time saved from AI [...] Published Time: 2024-11-19\n\nBetter, Faster, Leaner: Reinventing HR with Generative AI | Bain &amp; Company\n\nSkip to Content\n\n   Offices\n\n Close  #### Offices \n\n##### North &amp; Latin America&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Subscribe to the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast\n\nApple PodcastsSpotify\n\nBryan Hancock: In HR, we’re seeing agentic AI in talent acquisition. Agents clean records. They try to understand, “Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?” Then a separate agent goes through and scores those candidates and does the ranking and the sourcing process. A separate agent reaches out to gain contact and schedule interviews. [...] And then I think HR will play a key role—first, to really push the business on what can be done from a hybrid workforce perspective. Second, and we started seeing this in one of my clients, is where the technology is up and running, but the number of live interactions is not coming down. There is a big change management component that comes into play. HR will be absolutely critical there. [...] Brooke Weddle: Jorge, you mentioned IT becoming the HR of AI agents. And, of course, it was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who said this recently. When you think about a digital workforce, whose job is it to ensure that digital workforce is reaching its full potential? Is it more in the realm of IT? Or is this a space where HR might have a few things to say, since for a long time, getting managers to reach their full potential has been more their purview?&quot;,
