      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;At Workday, we build agentic AI to transform processes and deliver better experiences for our internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Agentic AI, defined.\n\nAgentic AI combines multiple AI models in an orchestrated, integrated way to allow a program to act autonomously within a broader environment. It uses reasoning, learning, and iterative planning to handle dynamic and multistep challenges within an organization. [...] Gartner® predicts that by 2028, one-third of enterprise software solutions will include agentic AI, making up to 15% of day-to-day decisions autonomous. Across industries, AI agents are already making their mark, helping hospitals manage complex admissions, supporting individually tailored academic plans at universities, optimizing inventory management for retailers, and much more. [...] Our recruiting agent incorporates HiredScore\\ capabilities to source passive candidates who may have expressed interest in the past. By understanding the current needs of the business and analyzing candidate profiles, the agent can automate outreach, recommend top candidates, and even schedule interviews. \n\n\\HiredScore is a Workday company.\n\nAt Workday, agentic AI is transforming areas such as expense tracking, succession planning, and smart recruiting.&quot;,

(NASDAQ: WDAY), the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents, today announced a new collaboration with Microsoft to help organizations securely manage their people and AI agents across their platforms. Customers that build AI agents using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio will be able to easily register and manage them within the Workday Agent System of Record (ASOR). This [...] Enhance Human-Agent Collaboration: The new integration between Workday and Microsoft&#x27;s agent systems will allow seamless interoperability between different AI agents. For example, an employee could ask a Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot to update career goals or submit a peer review. The request would be handed off to the Workday agent inline, allowing the employee to complete the workflow in Workday agent without leaving Microsoft Employee Self-Service Agent. [...] \&quot;Our partnership with Workday is a breakthrough in delivering the trust organizations need to adopt AI,\&quot; said Charles Lamanna, president, business and industry Copilot, Microsoft. \&quot;By seamlessly registering agents built with Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry into Workday&#x27;s Agent System of Record, we&#x27;re giving customers full visibility into their AI ecosystem.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Rather than displace jobs, agentic AI changes the nature of work. Agents take on repeatable, decision-bound tasks that follow clear logic or structured workflows. In doing so, they free up people to focus on work centered on creativity, intuition, innovation, and the ability to adapt amidst change and uncertainty.\n\nThis shift raises new requirements for how organizations design work. [...] The role of agentic AI is expanding—and so is the scope of decisions that must be made around it. Leaders must be intentional when shaping that transformation to unlock long-term advantage.\n\nWant to go deeper on how agentic AI is transforming work at scale? Discover how Workday is building enterprise-grade AI agents designed for trust, impact, and action.\n\nElevating Human Potential: The AI Skills Revolution [...] As organizations grapple with rising complexity, constrained resources, and relentless change, AI agents offer something rare: scalable intelligence that acts with purpose. And this evolution is underway across industries; Gartner predicts 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028—up from just 1% in 2024—and at least 15% of business decisions will be made autonomously via agents.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Our experts are working with clients to find opportunities to optimize plans and maintain uninterrupted access to high-quality health care to safeguard employee well-being and address financial challenges,” Mr. Balzano continued. [...] The report highlights that while cancer, diseases of the circulatory system and musculoskeletal conditions remain the top causes of claims by amount spent, the financial pressures on employer-sponsored health plans, such as inflation and more costly treatments, are intensifying. In addition, occupational risks, including job demands and exposure to noise and air pollution, have emerged as significant contributors to rising claim costs. [...] As individuals delay retirement and stay in the workforce longer, targeted benefits can play a major role in helping employees remain healthy, engaged and productive. Preventive care, such as cancer screenings and routine primary care visits, can help catch health issues early, reducing future costs and supporting long-term wellness.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Employers face persistent double-digit medical trend rate ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Our experts are working with clients to find opportunities to optimize plans and maintain uninterrupted access to high-quality health care to safeguard employee well-being and address financial challenges,” Mr. Balzano continued. [...] The report highlights that while cancer, diseases of the circulatory system and musculoskeletal conditions remain the top causes of claims by amount spent, the financial pressures on employer-sponsored health plans, such as inflation and more costly treatments, are intensifying. In addition, occupational risks, including job demands and exposure to noise and air pollution, have emerged as significant contributors to rising claim costs. [...] As individuals delay retirement and stay in the workforce longer, targeted benefits can play a major role in helping employees remain healthy, engaged and productive. Preventive care, such as cancer screenings and routine primary care visits, can help catch health issues early, reducing future costs and supporting long-term wellness.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The design embeds wellbeing throughout, featuring a modern gym and studio, roof terraces, and 72 secure cycle spaces with showers and changing facilities. Smart systems, including touchless smartphone access, a tenant engagement app, smart lift optimisation and real-time energy/waste monitoring, create a frictionless, intuitive experience day-to-day. [...] Kainos will be the lead occupier, taking four upper floors as its new global headquarters, with the remaining space available to other organisations.\n\nDeveloped by Bankmore Investments, the project blends the insights of a global technology company with the flexibility modern businesses expect – launching as a multi-let building rather than a single-tenant scheme. [...] Designed as a purpose-built, people-centred workplace, One Bankmore’s entrance lobby opens into casual meeting areas, a conversation pit and a coffee bar/restaurant, with a mezzanine library and reservable rooms for focused or collaborative work. For a calmer arrival, a dedicated low-stimulation route leads directly to the lifts, gym, office floors and roof terrace – supporting choice, wellbeing and neurodiversity from the front door.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Our experts are working with clients to find opportunities to optimize plans and maintain uninterrupted access to high-quality health care to safeguard employee well-being and address financial challenges,” Mr. Balzano continued. [...] The report highlights that while cancer, diseases of the circulatory system and musculoskeletal conditions remain the top causes of claims by amount spent, the financial pressures on employer-sponsored health plans, such as inflation and more costly treatments, are intensifying. In addition, occupational risks, including job demands and exposure to noise and air pollution, have emerged as significant contributors to rising claim costs. [...] As individuals delay retirement and stay in the workforce longer, targeted benefits can play a major role in helping employees remain healthy, engaged and productive. Preventive care, such as cancer screenings and routine primary care visits, can help catch health issues early, reducing future costs and supporting long-term wellness.&quot;,

Smart systems, including touchless smartphone access, a tenant engagement app, smart lift optimisation and real-time energy/waste monitoring, create a frictionless, intuitive experience day-to-day. [...] Kainos will be the lead occupier, taking four upper floors as its new global headquarters, with the remaining space available to other organisations.\n\nDeveloped by Bankmore Investments, the project blends the insights of a global technology company with the flexibility modern businesses expect – launching as a multi-let building rather than a single-tenant scheme. [...] Designed as a purpose-built, people-centred workplace, One Bankmore’s entrance lobby opens into casual meeting areas, a conversation pit and a coffee bar/restaurant, with a mezzanine library and reservable rooms for focused or collaborative work. For a calmer arrival, a dedicated low-stimulation route leads directly to the lifts, gym, office floors and roof terrace – supporting choice, wellbeing and neurodiversity from the front door.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI eats leisure time, makes employees work more, study finds&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In a research paper titled \&quot;AI and the Extended Workday: Productivity, Contracting Efficiency, and Distribution of Rents,\&quot; economists Wei Jiang (Emory), Junyoung Park (Auburn), Rachel (Jiqiu) Xiao (Fordham), and Shen Zhang (Seton Hall) set out to examine how occupational exposure to AI affects work time. [...] \&quot;The combined results suggest that while AI-driven productivity gains promise greater efficiency, they have resulted in longer working hours and lower employee satisfaction, especially in competitive markets and for occupations with higher AI complementarity, challenging the conventional expectation that technology frees humans from prolonged workdays,\&quot; the paper concludes. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n AI\n Employment\n Enterprise\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about [...] \&quot;People fill in fifteen-minute interval [summaries] about what they did in the previous day,\&quot; explained Jiang. \&quot;So you can actually trace out how much people work, and then we also link each occupation to their exposure to AI. So what we find is that higher exposure, if your job is more highly exposed to AI, you actually work longer.\&quot;\n\nAs Jiang and her colleagues observe in their paper, the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022 offers an opportunity to examine the labor impact of the technology.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Google Cloud\nGoogle Cloud\n\n# 使用 playbook 模拟器\n\nplaybook 模拟器提供了一种简化的方法，可帮助您以更少的时间和精力开发 playbook。\n\n借助 Playbook 模拟器，您可以利用以下几项主要功能：\n\n## 将 playbook 模拟器与 playbook 搭配使用\n\n无论您是使用现有 playbook 还是创建新 playbook，都应始终先开启 playbook 模拟器。您会在顶部看到一个绿色指示器，确认该功能已启用。\n\n如果您在有效 playbook 上使用 playbook 模拟器，则会影响触发该 playbook 的所有传入提醒。这是因为保存包含模拟数据的 playbook 会将该数据应用于生产环境中的实际支持请求，这可能会影响实际结果。\n\n## 解读每个步骤的模拟器结果\n\n点击运行后，控制台中的第一行会显示为实时剧本。每个模拟步骤都会显示一些选项，通常包括案例数据、查看结果和固定结果（或插入结果）。手动步骤会提示一个按钮来输入参数、提供回答和执行步骤。\n\n### 案例数据 [...] 从本质上讲，当您重新运行 playbook 时，系统会“跳过”所有具有固定结果的步骤：不会再次执行其代码，而是直接使用固定结果。您还可以通过插入自己的模拟数据来修改此结果。启用固定结果后，操作会进入模拟模式，相应步骤的视觉表示形式通常会从蓝色背景变为灰色背景，明确表明该步骤已启用模拟模式。\n\n### 插入结果\n\n如果某个步骤失败，插入结果选项会变为可用状态。借助此功能，您可以手动插入模拟数据。下次运行此特定步骤时，系统会返回您手动提供的数据作为结果。\n\n点击此选项后，相应操作会自动启用模拟模式。相应步骤的直观表示形式会从蓝色背景变为灰色背景，清晰表明模拟模式已启用。在模拟模式下，所有步骤都必须填写脚本结果字段。\n\n## 插入模拟数据\n\n如需插入模拟数据，您需要考虑以下几种使用情形：\n\n## 插入模拟数据\n\n您可以通过两种主要方式将模拟（模拟）数据插入到剧本中：通过剧本步骤配置对话框或在模拟器运行后使用固定结果（或插入结果）。\n\n### 使用 Playbook 步骤配置对话框\n\n### 使用模拟器运行后的结果\n\n#### 固定结果 [...] 案例数据图标会打开一个对话框，以显示该特定阶段（即当前操作运行完毕后）的案例信息。此对话框会根据当前步骤的结果动态更新。如果某项操作为支持请求添加了丰富信息，您会在此处看到相应信息。由于它显示的是执行某个步骤后的相应支持请求状态，因此模拟控制台中的数据会因步骤而异。检查不同步骤中的支持请求数据有助于您了解在执行剧本期间对支持请求应用了哪些更改。对话框中的多个标签页可提供更多详细信息。\n\n### 查看结果\n\n查看结果选项会显示当前步骤的具体操作结果。所呈现的信息类似于案例概览或案例墙，还包括有关任何丰富化处理的详细信息。\n\n您可以访问以下类型的信息：\n\n与其他选项类似，您可以点击数据进行更深入的检查。在查看结果页面上，您还可以点击设置 JSON 结果。借助此功能，您可以替换当前操作的 JSON 示例。您可以直接在集成式开发环境 (IDE) 中修改此 JSON 示例，然后在表达式构建器中以此为基础从 JSON 结果中提取特定数据。\n\n### 固定结果\n\n当某步骤成功运行时，固定结果选项可用。这是一项非常有用的功能，可让您将操作的结果视为固定值。\n\n固定结果可通过以下方式节省您的时间：&quot;,
