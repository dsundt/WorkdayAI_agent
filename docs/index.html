This move accelerates ServiceNow's BI capability and challenges Workday Prism on seamless, embedded analytics for enterprise SaaS. For both current and prospective Workday clients, this highlights the need to differentiate Prism’s capabilities—such as natively federated HR and finance analytics, extensibility via Workday Extend, and strong AI/ML signal orchestration.</p></li><li><strong>Oracle advances global rollouts of AI-driven HR with Etisalat &e (Feb 12, 2026)</strong><br/><p>Oracle’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ae/news/announcement/etisalatand-drives-ai-with-oracle-2026-02-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership win with Etisalat &e</a> underscores the adoption of agentic and generative AI features in major HR platform deals. The announcement signals Oracle’s focus on automated recruitment, AI-optimized journeys, and predictive workforce solutions—all areas where Workday’s Skills Cloud and AI Marketplace are competing for mindshare and budgets. For Deloitte Workday teams, this is a call to strengthen demo and ROI quantification for Workday’s agentic AI in talent and HR transformation projects.</p></li><li><strong>Okta introduces new security tools for managing shadow AI and agentic risk (Feb 12, 2026)</strong><br/><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/newsroom/press-releases/okta-secures-the-agentic-enterprise-with-new-tools-for-discovering-and-mitigating-shadow-ai-risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta’s launch</a> of dedicated governance and monitoring tools for shadow AI addresses a top concern for SaaS-enabled and agentic enterprises. This raises the bar for AI risk management, making secure agentic orchestration a new standard in enterprise buying.

Pyramid Analytics is known for its robust analytics and business intelligence (BI) solutions, making this move pivotal for ServiceNow customers aiming to gain deeper insights from their enterprise data while minimizing complexity. Technically, the deal accelerates ServiceNow’s ability to offer embedded analytics, combining Pyramid’s AI-driven reporting and predictive capabilities directly into ServiceNow’s workflow-centric environment. The competitive implication is profound: ServiceNow strengthens its proposition against Workday Prism Analytics, Oracle Fusion Analytics, and SAP Analytics Cloud, all of which have made similar moves in expanding analytics and embedded AI offerings. For Workday clients—especially those considering extensible analytics or orchestrated BI across HR, Finance, and Operations—this deal may drive urgency to evaluate Workday Prism&#x27;s differentiators (such as integrated HR/financial datasets, extensibility via Workday Extend, and AI/ML-powered signals). Deloitte’s Workday practice should proactively articulate Workday Prism’s value in contexts where cross-system analytics is a buying trigger, ensuring that clients understand the comparative advantages, platform synergies, and rapid deployment capabilities. Existing ServiceNow or Pyramid Analytics customers may revisit their BI strategy, potentially looking to consolidate or re-platform as a result of this acquisition.

The collaboration centers around the Oracle Fusion HCM platform’s generative and agentic AI suite, highlighting Oracle’s rapid commercialization of AI-enabled recruitment, talent, and workforce optimization tools. Strategically, this announcement underlines a key battleground: large multinationals are increasingly selecting AI-infused HR suites to automate candidate matching, personalize employee journeys, and predict workforce trends at scale—all capabilities also under active development at Workday through Skills Cloud and AI Marketplace expansions. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, the Oracle-&amp;e case shows where prospects are being swayed by promises of real-world AI automation, not just roadmaps. Technical teams should be ready with compelling demos of Workday’s AI-driven employee experience, generative workflows, and cross-tenant learning, ensuring that Workday’s differentiated AI assets (such as Skills Cloud’s taxonomical insights, or Extend’s agentic automation) are surfaced early in enterprise pursuits. Additionally, this public win sets a regional competitive precedent in the EMEA market for both platform and GSI-led implementations.

Announced on February 12, these tools give IT and security teams visibility into unauthorized or unsanctioned AI agents, workflows, or data movements within enterprise environments. From a technical and governance perspective, Okta is framing secure enablement of agentic AI as an enterprise necessity, with workflow-level authorization, monitoring, and audit becoming table stakes. This has broad implications for Workday and its partners, as clients deploying autonomous workflow bots or integrations via Workday Extend, Marketplace, or Prism must demonstrate effective controls around access, trust, and explainability. Deloitte&#x27;s Workday teams, especially those engaged with security-conscious or regulated clients, should ensure that AI governance, identity, and audit capabilities are highlighted in presales engagements, and consider cross-selling or alignment opportunities with Okta in managed Workday deployments. The competitive lens is also sharp: platforms that fail to ship robust agentic governance features could see their go-to-market credibility erode, particularly in regulated verticals or with partners such as Accenture or KPMG who are orienting their advisory services around responsible AI adoptions.
