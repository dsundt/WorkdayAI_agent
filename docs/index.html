<ul>
<li><strong>Workday Recognized as 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award Winner (Nov 5, 2025)</strong><br /><p>Workday has been honored as a 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award winner in recognition of its commitment to supporting client innovation and business transformation. The recognition highlights Workday's expanded focus on partner ecosystem, AI Marketplace, and co-innovation, which strengthen client outcomes in HR and finance transformation. This status validates Workday's ecosystem orientation and reinforces the importance of technology-consulting alliances for successful SaaS transformation.</p><a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>Oracle Recognized as a Leader in Two Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ Reports (Nov 5, 2025)</strong><br /><p>Oracle announced its placement as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for Cloud ERP and HCM. The acknowledgment reflects Oracle’s ongoing investment in enterprise AI, process automation, and enhanced agentic capabilities. For clients and integrators, this raises the importance of clear Workday differentiation—particularly as competition intensifies across AI features, integration, and security in HR and finance applications.</p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-recognized-as-a-leader-two-gartner-mq-reports-2025-11-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full announcement</a></li>
<li><strong>Infosys Develops AI Agent to Enhance Operations in the Workday Ecosystem (Nov 6, 2025)</strong><br /><p>Infosys has introduced a tailored AI agent to improve operations for Workday clients, focusing on workflow automation and process augmentation in HR and finance. This signals the drive among GSIs to expand beyond traditional implementation, developing proprietary agentic solutions to accelerate transformation for clients. Deloitte’s Workday practitioners should assess implications for GSI competition and co-innovation.</p><a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202511060524CANADANWCANADAPR_C0512-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View details</a></li>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle:</strong> Achieved Leader status in two Gartner Magic Quadrants for Cloud ERP and HCM (<a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-recognized-as-a-leader-two-gartner-mq-reports-2025-11-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details</a>). <em>Implication:</em> Strengthens Oracle’s client proposition and increases pressure on Workday and consultancies to convey clear AI and extensibility differentiation.</li>
<li><strong>UKG:</strong> Continued to scale Bryte AI Agent features in HCM suite. <em>Implication:</em> Raises the bar for agentic capabilities and seamless HR experiences, challenging Workday to evolve competitive features and messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Infosys:</strong> Launched new AI agent for the Workday ecosystem (<a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202511060524CANADANWCANADAPR_C0512-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nov 6, 2025</a>). <em>Implication:</em> Represents a GSI shift from implementation to proprietary AI agent innovation; Deloitte should move quickly on differentiating its own Workday agent accelerator offers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workday Agentic AI Use Cases</strong> – <a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/top-ai-agent-examples-and-industry-use-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best practices and examples</a>. <em>Outcome:</em> Stronger client advice and prototype pilots for Workday’s agentic AI adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiating Workday agentic extensibility</strong> – <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2024-09-17-Workday-Announces-New-AI-Agents-to-Transform-HR-and-Finance-Processes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Key platform innovations</a>. <em>Outcome:</em> Precise competitive messages in pre-sales and advisory work.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating and governing third-party AI agents</strong> – <a href="https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2025/the-agentic-ai-advantage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agentic AI risk & governance guide</a>. <em>Outcome:</em> Trusted approaches for safer, compliant Workday AI agent adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop briefing packs for client leaders on Workday versus Oracle/UKG agentic differentiation.</li>
<li>Identify new co-innovation potentials with Workday after Power Partner recognition.</li>
<li>Analyze Infosys’s new agent for Workday, focusing on innovation gaps and opportunities for Deloitte accelerators.</li>
<li>Refresh sales collateral with the latest competitive intelligence and industry accolades.</li>
<li>Plan enablement on GSI-built AI agent governance in Workday transformation projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle leader recognition may sway dual-evaluation clients.</strong><br /><em>Mitigation:</em> Arm sales/advisory teams with concrete Workday differentiation assets and success stories.</li>
<li><strong>Governance challenges for GSI-built agents in Workday.</strong><br /><em>Mitigation:</em> Disseminate best practices and frameworks for agent lifecycle risk management to clients and teams.</li>
<li><strong>Potential dilution of Workday’s ecosystem/innovation message.</strong><br /><em>Mitigation:</em> Standardize recent messaging and ensure front-line teams are trained to leverage best-in-ecosystem proof points.</li>

Strategic attention for Deloitte&#x27;s Workday practice should focus on partnership leverage and market positioning in light of accelerating competitive announcements.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Recognized as 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award Winner (Published: Nov 5, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday was recognized on November 5th as a 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award winner, specifically for its consistent support for client innovation and business transformation through its enterprise cloud solutions and partner ecosystem. The award signals growing acknowledgment of Workday’s strategy to deepen its ecosystem and partner program, particularly as it ramps up AI-driven HR and finance agentic solutions. This recognition puts the spotlight on Workday’s investment in collaborative solutions, extensibility, and co-innovation with GSIs and boutique partners, reinforcing its emphasis on accelerating client outcomes and adoption of new agentic technologies within the Workday platform.\\n\\nStrategically, this matters because Workday&#x27;s Power Partner status highlights the company’s focus not just on core application delivery, but on building an interconnected landscape of technology and consultative services—including AI marketplace alliances—that enable rapid digital transformation. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, it signals an opportunity to deepen client conversations around joint value realization, co-innovation with Workday, and ecosystem-led solutioning.\\n\\nFor Workday clients, the award signals that the platform’s partner orientation is being validated in the broader software and transformation market, which may influence RFP and vendor selection processes over the coming months.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Recognized as a Leader in Two Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ Reports (Published: Nov 5, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s November 5th recognition as a Leader in two Gartner Magic Quadrants—pertaining to both Cloud ERP and HCM suites—demonstrates its continuous investments in expanding AI-driven process automation, agentic capabilities, and secure enterprise-grade HR/Finance platforms. Oracle emphasized improved AI agent functionality, analytics integration, and autonomous capabilities. The Gartner positioning, supported by Oracle’s recent innovation cycles, has potential to shift C-suite mindshare, especially among clients weighing between Workday and Oracle for large-scale transformation.\\n\\nFrom a competitive perspective for Deloitte’s Workday practice, this further raises the threshold for proof points and value demos in pre-sales, necessitating more nuanced differentiation—particularly around Workday’s extensibility (e.g., Extend/Marketplace), AI-native architecture, and co-innovation ecosystem. Differences in agentic AI explainability, workflow integration, and security protocols are areas that clients will scrutinize in RFPs.\\n\\nClients should expect increased marketing pressure from Oracle around its leadership status and integrated AI, which may recalibrate their vendor evaluation cycles.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-recognized-as-a-leader-two-gartner-mq-reports-2025-11-05\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Infosys Develops AI Agent to Enhance Operations in the Workday Ecosystem (Published: Nov 6, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On November 6th, Infosys announced development of a specialized AI agent solution aimed at optimizing client operations within the Workday ecosystem. This solution focuses on layered workflow automation and process augmentation for HR and finance processes leveraging Workday’s open AI and extensibility features. Infosys positions this as supporting client agility, reducing time-to-value for Workday deployments, and aligning with broader enterprise AI transformation initiatives.\\n\\nThis matters strategically because Infosys serves major multinational Workday clients and often sets the pace for AI-enabled deployments. Its new AI agent development indicates intensifying competition among GSIs to go beyond traditional implementation to deliver proprietary agentic solutions. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, understanding Infosys’s approach can inform the development of differentiated accelerators or custom agents, and guide conversations with clients seeking innovation alongside standardized deployment.\\n\\nFor Workday clients, such GSI-built solutions could yield accelerated outcomes but also raise questions about vendor lock-in and the long-term governance of third-party AI agents running within Workday core.\\n\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202511060524CANADANWCANADAPR_C0512-1\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Achieved Leader status in two Gartner Magic Quadrant reports on Nov 5, 2025, for Cloud ERP and HCM, underscoring its momentum in AI-enabled automation and HCM innovation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This enhances Oracle’s credibility among shared enterprise clients and creates pressure for both Workday and system integrators like Deloitte to articulate clear points of differentiation in AI, agentic capabilities, and enterprise extensibility during vendor selection and roadmap steering.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Continued expansion and marketing of Bryte AI Agents deepening agentic capabilities in the HCM suite.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;UKG&#x27;s evolution of Bryte AI Agents highlights the rapid proliferation of AI-powered agentic features in Workday’s competitive landscape. UKG is emphasizing improvements in employee self-service, interaction, and experience through its agentic models, raising customer expectations for seamless, human-like HR support.
