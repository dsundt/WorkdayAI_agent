<li><strong>Alight Expands AI Collaboration With IBM to Advance Benefits Technology (Published: 2025-10-30)</strong><br/>
<p>Alight announced an expanded partnership with IBM to advance benefits technology by integrating IBM’s AI capabilities with Alight’s platform. This joint effort is designed to deliver more responsive, adaptable, and cost-effective benefits solutions for employers and employees. Through this collaboration, Alight aims to accelerate automation, improve decision making, and enhance user experience within benefits administration workflows.<br/>
<br/>
Strategically, this move indicates intensifying competition among HR technology vendors—Workday included—to harness AI for tangible business outcomes. IBM’s AI integration highlights the sector-wide focus on agentic automation and intelligent insights. The partnership also sets a new benchmark for innovation in benefits-related SaaS offerings, challenging all ecosystem participants to match or exceed these capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
For Workday clients and Deloitte, this underlines the growing demand for platforms that deliver not just process efficiency, but also greater personalization and integrated decision support. Deloitte’s advisory teams should be equipped to help clients evaluate competing AI offerings and optimize HR technology investments. <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510301635BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251030_BW476696-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full release</a> | <a href="https://www.alight.com/about/newsroom/alight-expands-ai-collaboration-with-ibm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alight newsroom</a></p></li>
<li><strong>Workday Skills Cloud and Skills-Based Talent Transformation in Focus (Ongoing, context: 2025-10-30)</strong><br/>
<p>Skills Cloud remains at the forefront of Workday’s product positioning. Its AI-powered skills inference, matching, and taxonomy updates are helping organizations transition to skills-based talent models—improving internal mobility, upskilling, and alignment with evolving business needs.<br/>
<br/>
This differentiates Workday in the HCM market, where competing platforms (SAP, Oracle, UKG) are racing to build similar capabilities. GSIs like PwC stress that a skills-based approach accelerates workforce transformation, reduces time to productivity, and better supports future-of-work strategies.<br/>
<br/>
For Deloitte, there’s a significant opportunity to lead clients through Skills Cloud-enabled transformation, building on proven methodologies, case studies, and change management expertise. <a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Skills Cloud</a> | <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-skills-based-approach-to-talent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PwC Workday Skills Approach</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong><br/>
<p>Oracle is advancing its AI features across cloud infrastructure and HCM offerings, with recent release notes underscoring improvements in predictive analytics and agentic automation. These enhancements mirror market demand for embedded intelligence in HR workflows and prompt both Workday and Deloitte to maintain a client focus on tailored, outcome-driven solutions. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/releasenotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Cloud Release Notes</a></p></li>
<li><strong>SAP</strong><br/>
<p>SAP’s HCM strategy evolves with the ongoing introduction of Business AI and Joule Agents, targeting agentic workflows and enhanced skills automation. The competitive landscape for intelligent HR platforms is becoming more nuanced, requiring advisors to communicate well-differentiated value propositions. <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/human-capital-management-blog-posts-by-sap/what-s-new-with-sap-business-ai-joule-and-joule-agents-in-the-sap/ba-p/14257508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business AI Update</a></p></li>
<li><strong>UKG</strong><br/>
<p>UKG maintains a high publishing cadence around AI for HR and digital workforce innovation, specifically emphasizing ecosystem AI integrations. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, this positions UKG as a strong midmarket competitor and highlights the need for proactive, insight-driven client engagement. <a href="https://www.ukg.com/learn/resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UKG Resources</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update client playbooks with fresh analyses of AI partnerships and competitive benchmarks in benefits and skills-based HR.</li>
<li>Plan enablement sessions on Skills Cloud, referencing the latest Workday and PwC content.</li>
<li>Shortlist client opportunities for Skills Cloud activation or expansion.</li>
<li>Sync with Deloitte cross-practice teams on AI-driven vendor selection trends.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration complexity and vendor proliferation</strong>: Provide frameworks and blueprints to clarify Workday’s value and integration roadmap for clients.</li>
<li><strong>Change management gaps in skills transformation</strong>: Expand enablement and stakeholder workshops with early-win metrics.</li>

Workday’s ongoing advances in skills intelligence and meaningful ecosystem partnerships remain critical for clients and Deloitte&#x27;s Workday practice.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Alight Expands AI Collaboration With IBM to Advance Benefits Technology (Published: 2025-10-30)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Alight announced an expanded AI collaboration with IBM aimed at strengthening benefits administration and technological innovation for their mutual clients. The partnership leverages IBM’s AI expertise and Alight’s domain knowledge to deliver more adaptive, responsive, and cost-effective solutions in the benefits space. The joint work includes integrating IBM’s AI capabilities into Alight’s platform to enhance automation, decision support, and employee experience. \\n\\nStrategically, this move signals a deepening trend among leading HR tech vendors—Workday included—toward tightly integrating advanced AI to meet rising client expectations for personalization and process automation. For Workday and its ecosystem, the partnership benchmarks the increasing need for SaaS platforms to provide not just data, but actionable intelligence and automation in key business functions like benefits.\\n\\nFor Workday clients and Deloitte’s practice, this underscores two implications: (1) Demand for integrated AI-enabled benefits solutions will rise, pushing Workday and its partners to accelerate joint innovation and competitive differentiation, and (2) Clients will seek guidance navigating an increasingly complex vendor landscape where AI partnerships multiply. Deloitte must be ready to deliver advisory and integration services that distill real-world value from such global alliances.\\n\\nSee: https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510301635BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251030_BW476696-1,\\nhttps://www.alight.com/about/newsroom/alight-expands-ai-collaboration-with-ibm\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510301635BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251030_BW476696-1\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Skills Cloud and Skills-Based Talent Transformation in Focus (Ongoing, context: 2025-10-30)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Recent updates and case studies continue to highlight the momentum behind Workday’s Skills Cloud and skills intelligence offerings. Workday’s Skills Cloud is central to enabling organizations to shift from role-based to skills-based talent strategies, improving agility in hiring, development, and deployment. Its AI-driven matching, skill inference, and taxonomy updates create a dynamic framework for workforce transformation.\\n\\nStrategically, this capability distinguishes Workday in the competitive HCM market. Major GSIs like PwC highlight the measurable value of a skills-based approach—faster upskilling, improved internal mobility, and better alignment with future-of-work demands. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this speaks to a robust opportunity for skills transformation programs, integrating change management, data enrichment, and intelligent automation.\\n\\nAs vendors like SAP, Oracle, and UKG rush to bolster their own skills frameworks, Workday’s active product-led approach raises both client expectations and the bar for transformation partners. Deloitte teams should proactively surface client opportunities to activate or expand Skills Cloud adoption, supported by reference case studies and outcome-based roadmaps.\\n\\nSee: https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html,\\nhttps://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-skills-based-approach-to-talent.html\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Ongoing innovation in AI for HR, documented in Oracle’s AI updates and cloud release notes.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle continues to emphasize its AI-driven advancements across cloud infrastructure and HCM. Current initiatives focus on improving predictive analytics, agentic process capabilities, and integrated user experiences. This trajectory pushes Workday to maintain a rapid pace of AI feature delivery and deepens the need for Deloitte to differentiate through tailored advisory and integrated solutions that maximize Workday’s capabilities versus Oracle’s evolving suite.

This joint effort is designed to deliver more responsive, adaptable, and cost-effective benefits solutions for employers and employees. Through this collaboration, Alight aims to accelerate automation, improve decision making, and enhance user experience within benefits administration workflows.&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nStrategically, this move indicates intensifying competition among HR technology vendors—Workday included—to harness AI for tangible business outcomes. IBM’s AI integration highlights the sector-wide focus on agentic automation and intelligent insights. The partnership also sets a new benchmark for innovation in benefits-related SaaS offerings, challenging all ecosystem participants to match or exceed these capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nFor Workday clients and Deloitte, this underlines the growing demand for platforms that deliver not just process efficiency, but also greater personalization and integrated decision support. Deloitte’s advisory teams should be equipped to help clients evaluate competing AI offerings and optimize HR technology investments. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510301635BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251030_BW476696-1\\\&quot;&gt;Full release&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.alight.com/about/newsroom/alight-expands-ai-collaboration-with-ibm\\\&quot;&gt;Alight newsroom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workday Skills Cloud and Skills-Based Talent Transformation in Focus (Ongoing, context: 2025-10-30)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Skills Cloud remains at the forefront of Workday’s product positioning. Its AI-powered skills inference, matching, and taxonomy updates are helping organizations transition to skills-based talent models—improving internal mobility, upskilling, and alignment with evolving business needs.&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nThis differentiates Workday in the HCM market, where competing platforms (SAP, Oracle, UKG) are racing to build similar capabilities. GSIs like PwC stress that a skills-based approach accelerates workforce transformation, reduces time to productivity, and better supports future-of-work strategies.&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\nFor Deloitte, there’s a significant opportunity to lead clients through Skills Cloud-enabled transformation, building on proven methodologies, case studies, and change management expertise. &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html\\\&quot;&gt;See Skills Cloud&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-skills-based-approach-to-talent.html\\\&quot;&gt;PwC Workday Skills Approach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Watch&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Oracle is advancing its AI features across cloud infrastructure and HCM offerings, with recent release notes underscoring improvements in predictive analytics and agentic automation.

This effort aims to create more responsive, adaptable, and efficient solutions for employers and employees. IBM’s AI will accelerate automation, improve decision support, and enhance user and employee experiences. For Workday and its ecosystem, this highlights an urgent market-wide race to add real AI-driven intelligence and automation to core HR and benefits offerings. Deloitte must help clients evaluate rapid-fire AI partnerships and optimize their HR technology strategies. https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/detail?dockey=600-202510301635BIZWIRE_USPRX____20251030_BW476696-1 | https://www.alight.com/about/newsroom/alight-expands-ai-collaboration-with-ibm\\n\\n- Workday Skills Cloud and Skills-Based Talent Transformation in Focus (Ongoing, context: 2025-10-30)\\nWorkday’s Skills Cloud continues to gain momentum as clients adopt skills-based transformation. Workday’s AI-powered skills inference, matching, and taxonomy management underpin new, agile workforce strategies focused on upskilling, mobility, and future-readiness. PwC’s highlighted approach demonstrates clear outcomes from skills-based models—including improved internal talent mobility and reduced time to productivity. Workday’s consistent, product-led innovation sets a high bar, while Deloitte practices must proactively surface these transformation opportunities to clients. https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/human-capital-management/skills-cloud.html | https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-skills-based-approach-to-talent.html\\n\\nCompetitive Watch\\n- Oracle: Ongoing AI upgrades in HCM and cloud platform, per current release notes, keep pushing predictive analytics and automated workflows.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The global EY organization is most excited about the next stage and adopting more agentic AI, which has the potential to process more workflows with multiple autonomous AI agents. For instance, systems won’t just tell employees how to submit an expense report but could add up receipts and submit a report for approval with minimal human intervention. Working with ServiceNow, the aim is to stay on the leading edge of the fast-evolving world of agentic AI. [...] After finding success with service desk agents, the global EY organization expanded AI accessibility to all employees with an AI agent available through the portal. When employees have simple questions, such as how to reset a password, they can now self-serve. The AI agent also understands intent so employees can find exactly what they need in less time. [...] “We went from 1.4 tickets per service desk agent each day five years ago to 0.3 tickets today thanks to the investments in AI, self-service and automation,” says Ray. “It’s allowed us to handle growth while maintaining excellent service and outcomes for employees.”\n\nStaying on the leading edge of AI to simplify even more routine employee processes such as answering basic HR questions or tallying, submitting and routing expense reports&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;So long, SaaS: Why AI spells end of per-seat software ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This will lead to a fundamental transformation in how software solutions are used, valued, and integrated into their operations, said Natasha Chryssafi, senior director of product management at Wolters Kluwer tax and accounting. \&quot;AI agents will increasingly act on behalf of users, automating tasks, making decisions, and collaborating across systems. This reduces the need for direct human interaction with software interfaces.\&quot; [...] Across the industry, there is a general consensus that the software delivery model is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by AI and AI agents. \&quot;The transition to agentic architecture will evolve at a pace significantly faster than the evolution of client/server-based applications to cloud computing,\&quot; predicted George Brown, partner at Partner Economics. \&quot;Companies cannot ignore a reduction of costs by more than 20%, as it will make them uncompetitive.\&quot; [...] Importantly, Chryssafi added, \&quot;as AI agents take on more responsibility, appropriate human oversight, transparency, ethical use, and data governance will become critical. Customers will need assurance that systems operate reliably and responsibly.\&quot;\n\n## The risk for customers&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;7 Key Elements of an Agentic Enterprise&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is the agentic enterprise, a seamless ecosystem where human employees and artificial intelligence (AI) agents work side by side. “It’s an enterprise in which you rethink your whole business or organisation to ask, ‘Where can agents help?’” said Jim Roth, president of customer success at Salesforce. [...] The agentic enterprise is about more than adopting new AI tools. It’s a fundamental rethinking of how work gets done, and the biggest shift in the workplace since the Industrial Revolution. Here are seven key elements that define an agentic enterprise.\n\n## 1. Conversations become actions\n\nAI agents can automatically follow up on employees’ conversations and take the necessary action.\n\n## 2. Agents are built into the flow of work [...] Imagine a workplace where companies move with greater efficiency and speed by pairing humans with AI-powered agents. Where this partnership happens in the platforms that employees work in, like customer relationship management (CRM) or collaboration software. Where leaders rethink processes from the ground up, so that workforces can stretch and grow in ways only dreamed of in the past.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Heltewigh described agentic AI as a reinvention of how businesses and customers interact, where AI can reason, collaborate, and act independently while remaining governed and explainable. In his words, \&quot;AI is now melting the organizational chart.\&quot; Tasks that once sat in different departments can now flow freely across them, enabling faster resolutions and seamless experiences.\n\nAlso: More IT leaders are using AI to cut costs - but not in the ways you&#x27;d expect, Gartner finds [...] This perspective aligns with Aberdeen&#x27;s research, which shows that CX leaders outperform peers by connecting customer, operational, and workforce data into a unified strategy and workflow to deliver hyper-personalized experiences. Comstock positioned NiCE&#x27;s CX platform as a foundation for orchestrating customer engagement across the entire enterprise.\n\n## From conversational AI to agentic AI [...] The emphasis on AI-ready data is particularly noteworthy. As agentic AI initiatives become more prevalent, the quality and accessibility of CX data will increasingly differentiate successful implementations from those that struggle to deliver value. Companies that have invested in capturing high-fidelity, omnichannel interaction data will be better positioned to train and deploy AI agents that truly understand customer context and intent.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;So long, SaaS: Why AI spells end of per-seat software ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Across the industry, there is a general consensus that the software delivery model is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by AI and AI agents. \&quot;The transition to agentic architecture will evolve at a pace significantly faster than the evolution of client/server-based applications to cloud computing,\&quot; predicted George Brown, partner at Partner Economics. \&quot;Companies cannot ignore a reduction of costs by more than 20%, as it will make them uncompetitive.\&quot; [...] This will lead to a fundamental transformation in how software solutions are used, valued, and integrated into their operations, said Natasha Chryssafi, senior director of product management at Wolters Kluwer tax and accounting. \&quot;AI agents will increasingly act on behalf of users, automating tasks, making decisions, and collaborating across systems. This reduces the need for direct human interaction with software interfaces.\&quot; [...] It may take some time for the rest of the industry to evolve and adjust.\n\n\&quot;The technology stack required to fully realize this vision is not yet ready,\&quot; said Rob Fuller, chief solutions officer at Blend360. \&quot;Any model that involves internal agents interacting with external agents is highly immature, and at this stage, human use of agents is far more common and practical, aside from a few narrow and intentional exceptions.\&quot;&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Like most vendors in the enterprise application market, ServiceNow is peddling AI agents as the solution to the productivity puzzle. CEO Bill McDermott said that internally, 90 percent of the IT, customer service, and HR processes were now being done by agents, \&quot;not at the exclusion of people, but to make people happier.\&quot;\n\nHe said \&quot;the soul-crushing stuff is done by the agent and the people are doing more and serving more capability to our customers.\&quot; [...] The tech vendor, which provides a service layer and AI agents on top of business applications, posted $3.4 billion in revenue for calendar Q3, up 22 percent year-on-year. Operating margin was 33.5 percent, three percentage points higher than the company&#x27;s expectations.\n\nSubscription revenue – the bulk of the SaaS player&#x27;s income – outstripped analyst forecasts. ServiceNow increased its overall guidance for the full year. [...] Although ServiceNow has increased its headcount, analyst firm Forrester warned that companies making job cuts because of expected AI efficiencies will start quietly rehiring staff in 2026. ®\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n#### More about\n\ncomment bubble on white\n\n#### More about\n\n### More about\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Resilience, not sovereignty, defines OpenStack&#x27;s next chapter&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Generally, moving from theory to practice in AI depends on the industry and the size of the company, as well as the level of investment. Small companies or highly vertical manufacturing tend to adopt AI in internal processes as they’re usually satisfied with products like Copilot and a virtual assistant. But moving from theory to practice requires budgeting for costs beyond the purchase of the platform or licenses. [...] Banca Etica is currently conducting a pilot with Google Gemini, testing a series of use cases such as meeting transcription, text generation, and document summary. The goal is to identify the practical applications most useful to the bank’s employees, and limit their use to these specific cases, with controlled benefits and risks, and HR support for training. [...] “For now, we too have stopped at individual projects and are waiting for the technology to evolve,” he adds.\n\n## A dedicated department for AI\n\nRidulfo considers AI to be both an IT and HR issue that requires training and making people aware of its potential and risks, such as data exposure or even loss of skills.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;7 Key Elements of an Agentic Enterprise&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is the agentic enterprise, a seamless ecosystem where human employees and artificial intelligence (AI) agents work side by side. “It’s an enterprise in which you rethink your whole business or organisation to ask, ‘Where can agents help?’” said Jim Roth, president of customer success at Salesforce. [...] The agentic enterprise is about more than adopting new AI tools. It’s a fundamental rethinking of how work gets done, and the biggest shift in the workplace since the Industrial Revolution. Here are seven key elements that define an agentic enterprise.\n\n## 1. Conversations become actions\n\nAI agents can automatically follow up on employees’ conversations and take the necessary action.\n\n## 2. Agents are built into the flow of work [...] Imagine a workplace where companies move with greater efficiency and speed by pairing humans with AI-powered agents. Where this partnership happens in the platforms that employees work in, like customer relationship management (CRM) or collaboration software. Where leaders rethink processes from the ground up, so that workforces can stretch and grow in ways only dreamed of in the past.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Our research shows that over half (53%) of organisations admit they lack knowledge in applying AI for cyber defence, while many cite unclear risk appetite (44%) or leadership uncertainty on the value of AI (40%). And one of the biggest barriers to digital trust is fragmentation: privacy often sits with legal, resilience with operations and security with IT. This fractured model creates duplication and blurred accountability. Trust can only be built when leaders break down silos so that [...] ## Trust as the ultimate differentiator\n\nThe next decade will not be defined by who has the most data, the fastest AI model or the strongest defences. It will be defined by who is trusted to use digital technology responsibly, fairly and resiliently. [...] Although we might not label it explicitly, what is emerging is a digital trust operating model – a joined-up way of working that runs across the organisation. It starts with leadership, where boards take ownership of trust and link it directly to strategic goals. It is reinforced by culture, as employees are empowered and rewarded for the behaviours that build resilience and integrity. It is underpinned by technology and data systems that are not only secure, but also ethical, transparent and&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The global EY organization is most excited about the next stage and adopting more agentic AI, which has the potential to process more workflows with multiple autonomous AI agents. For instance, systems won’t just tell employees how to submit an expense report but could add up receipts and submit a report for approval with minimal human intervention. Working with ServiceNow, the aim is to stay on the leading edge of the fast-evolving world of agentic AI. [...] After finding success with service desk agents, the global EY organization expanded AI accessibility to all employees with an AI agent available through the portal. When employees have simple questions, such as how to reset a password, they can now self-serve. The AI agent also understands intent so employees can find exactly what they need in less time. [...] “We went from 1.4 tickets per service desk agent each day five years ago to 0.3 tickets today thanks to the investments in AI, self-service and automation,” says Ray. “It’s allowed us to handle growth while maintaining excellent service and outcomes for employees.”\n\nStaying on the leading edge of AI to simplify even more routine employee processes such as answering basic HR questions or tallying, submitting and routing expense reports&quot;,
