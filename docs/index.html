<ul>
  <li><strong>Advocate Health Selects Workday to Elevate Employee and Patient Experience (2025-11-06)</strong><br/>
    <p>Advocate Health, one of the largest nonprofit U.S. health systems, has selected <a href="https://investor.workday.com/2025-11-06-Advocate-Health-Elevates-Employee-and-Patient-Experience-with-Workday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday</a> to advance workforce and patient service transformation. The rollout demonstrates Workday’s strength in supporting enterprise-wide agility, compliance, and analytics in complex healthcare environments. This major sector win supports Workday’s continued expansion in healthcare and signals consulting opportunities for AI-powered, sector-tailored offerings. Healthcare clients will benefit from advanced workforce analytics, skills management, and unified process automation, all crucial for digital resilience. For Deloitte, it validates focus on healthcare consulting and thought leadership leveraging the Workday Skills Cloud and AI Marketplace.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UKG: Aggressive Push on Bryte AI and Guided Experiences</strong><br/>
    <p>UKG is rapidly expanding its Bryte AI Agent portfolio, embedding agentic and conversational AI as flagship features (<a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsroom</a>, <a href="https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-debuts-ai-guided-user-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-guided experience</a>). These capabilities enable highly responsive digital HR support, raising the competitive bar for real-time automation and user engagement in HCM. For Workday and Deloitte, there is a need to counter-position with demonstrations of Workday’s scalable, responsible, and extensible AI ecosystem, including Extend and Marketplace agents, particularly for large enterprises balancing innovation and governance.</p>
    <p>UKG’s momentum in agentic AI reinforces urgency for Workday leaders and consultants to curate point-of-view content and best practices, distinguishing between hype and achieved outcomes in live customer deployments.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dayforce: Launches Next-Gen AI Agents for HR and Global Payroll</strong><br/>
    <p>Dayforce announced new AI Agents focused on accelerating productivity and personalization in HR, payroll, and talent management (<a href="https://www.dayforce.com/who-we-are/newsroom/dayforce-introduces-new-dayforce-ai-agents-to-accelerate-how-work-gets-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsroom</a>, <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/why-dayforce/dayforce-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suite</a>, <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/blog/dayforce-co-pilot-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-pilot blog</a>). This aligns with a market trend where enterprises expect HR suites to proactively support users and automate routine tasks. The implication is clear: Workday and its ecosystem partners must champion tangible, high-impact AI use cases and readiness frameworks to avoid customer perception gaps as rivals tout advanced agentic features.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/ai-agents-for-hr-top-use-cases-and-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agentic AI for HR: Use Cases and Examples</a> — Empowers teams with credible scenarios for agentic AI deployment and value mapping. 90-day impact: Deeper client advisory and pilot delivery readiness.</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/responsible-ai-governance-workday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Governance at Workday</a> — Equips practitioners to consult and implement robust governance, trust, and bias mitigation in Workday AI deployments. 90-day impact: Increased client confidence and regulatory alignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Publish a competitive analysis brief for sales, contrasting agentic AI capabilities and value proof points across Workday, UKG, and Dayforce.</li>
  <li>Run a targeted enablement session for healthcare-focused teams on Workday's Skills Cloud and advanced analytics.</li>
  <li>Review lessons from current client AI agent pilots to produce practical transformation playbooks for Q4 opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Competitive noise from UKG and Dayforce may eclipse Workday's AI strengths.<br/>
      <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Prioritize go-to-market storytelling anchored in live client results, especially in healthcare and global HCM.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Heightened scrutiny on responsible AI and compliance in HR.
      <br/><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Expand visible adoption of Workday’s responsible AI frameworks and coach clients on compliance as a differentiator.</li>

Meanwhile, competitors are aggressively pushing agentic AI in HR and HCM, intensifying the need for Workday and Deloitte to accelerate differentiation, especially around Skills Cloud, AI extensibility, and responsible AI governance.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Advocate Health Selects Workday to Elevate Employee and Patient Experience (2025-11-06)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Advocate Health, one of America&#x27;s largest nonprofit health systems, announced deployment of Workday across its large workforce, aiming to streamline operations and bolster both employee engagement and patient care. The implementation underscores Workday&#x27;s ability to deliver enterprise-scale solutions in highly regulated, complex healthcare settings. Importantly, Advocate Health highlights how the unified Workday platform, including Human Capital Management and Financial Management, supports data-driven decision-making, skills development, and agile workforce management—all critical for scaling healthcare operations.\\n\\nStrategically, this validates Workday&#x27;s industry cloud approach for healthcare: deepening sector penetration at a time when healthcare providers are under mounting pressure for digital transformation and operational efficiency. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this signals continued momentum and consulting demand in healthcare—especially for integrating Workday&#x27;s Skills Cloud, workforce analytics, and AI-driven capabilities to support organizational resilience and patient-centered innovation. As other HR tech vendors target sector-specific features, this win affirms that Workday remains a trusted, future-ready partner for healthcare digital transformation.\\n\\nThis announcement matters not just as a customer case but as a barometer for Workday’s healthcare relevance. The ability to leverage advanced AI and automation within a secure, compliant cloud platform is a compelling differentiator, strengthening Workday’s narrative vs. Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow in the health sector.\\n\\nSource: https://investor.workday.com/2025-11-06-Advocate-Health-Elevates-Employee-and-Patient-Experience-with-Workday\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://investor.workday.com/2025-11-06-Advocate-Health-Elevates-Employee-and-Patient-Experience-with-Workday\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;UKG\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;UKG continues aggressive innovation and marketing of its Bryte AI Agents and new AI-guided user experiences for HCM, positioning &#x27;Agentic AI&#x27; as a core differentiator across its suite.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;UKG’s investments in practical, conversational AI agents—now embedded in workflow and employee self-service—put pressure on Workday to accelerate public proofs of value around autonomous experiences in Workday HCM. As more enterprises evaluate agentic AI for HR, Deloitte’s Workday teams need to articulate Workday’s strengths in scalable, responsible agent deployment (e.g., via Extend and the AI Marketplace), while tracking UKG&#x27;s traction in heavily service-oriented industries.\\n\\nRelevant sources:\\n- https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-unveils-bryte-ai-agents-and-capabilities-transform-employee-experiences-ukg-pro-hcm-suite\\n- https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-debuts-ai-guided-user-experience\\n- https://www.ukg.com/company/newsroom/ukg-bryte-ai-revolutionizes-how-employees-find-help-and-information\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Dayforce\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Dayforce announced the launch of new Dayforce AI Agents designed to boost productivity, personalization, and support for global HR and payroll customers.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;This expansion of Dayforce&#x27;s agentic AI illustrates the growing expectation for real-time, autonomous support in HR processes.

to advance workforce and patient service transformation. The rollout demonstrates Workday’s strength in supporting enterprise-wide agility, compliance, and analytics in complex healthcare environments. This major sector win supports Workday’s continued expansion in healthcare and signals consulting opportunities for AI-powered, sector-tailored offerings. Healthcare clients will benefit from advanced workforce analytics, skills management, and unified process automation, all crucial for digital resilience.
