<ul>
  <li><strong>Workday Recognized as a 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award Winner (Nov 5, 2025)</strong><br />
    <p>Workday’s recognition as an Inc. Power Partner marks a significant endorsement of its ongoing value and trust within the digital transformation ecosystem. The award, described in <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday's newsroom</a>, provides differentiation against increasing competition and supports Deloitte teams in client-facing discussions to cement Workday’s brand as stable, innovative, and resilient during rapid SaaS evolution. This external validation is a tool for winning new business and reaffirming relationships, especially as enterprise AI adoption soars and clients prioritize platform trust.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Workday Announces Upcoming Q3 FY2026 Financial Results Call (Nov 4, 2025)</strong><br />
    <p>The <a href="https://en-gb.newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-04-Workday-to-Announce-Fiscal-2026-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results-on-November-25,-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> of Workday’s upcoming earnings call signals a critical check-in point for clients reviewing Workday’s performance in the shifting AI SaaS landscape. The results and accompanying commentary will inform competitive positioning, client AI adoption pace, and pipeline confidence. For Deloitte, readiness to interpret and communicate these details ensures clients perceive the firm as proactive and informed in guiding Workday-centric transformations.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leader placement in IDC MarketScape for AI-Enabled Enterprise ERP (Nov 4, 2025)</a> — Microsoft's prestigious position demonstrates rapid integration of AI and agentic process automation at scale, raising expectations for all cloud ERP/HCM vendors. This forces Workday and its partners to accelerate roadmap communications and innovation playbooks, focusing on differentiated attributes such as people-centric design and integration extensibility.
  </li>
  <li><strong>ADP</strong>: <a href="https://www.adp.com/resources/what-others-say/analyst-reports/forrester-named-adp-a-leader-in-hcm-wave-2025-evaluation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forrester HCM Wave 2025 Leader</a> — ADP's strengths in adaptive AI and extensibility challenge Workday’s core differentiators. Deloitte and advisory teams should update RFP approaches to articulate Workday’s unique ecosystem value and business impact, leveraging tangible case studies and independent validations.
  </li>
  <li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>: <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/community/servicenow-ai-platform-blog/servicenow-releases-voice-agents-as-part-of-the-ai-experience/ba-p/3419367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voice Agents for HR Service Delivery (Nov 2025)</a> — ServiceNow's agentic conversational AI ups the ante for seamless, automated employee services. This trend propels urgency for Workday and partners to match or surpass these innovations, ensuring competitive parity and future relevance in client platforms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI-Driven HCM Transformation Storytelling</strong>: Use <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday’s Inc. Power Partner announcement</a> to strengthen proposals and client presentations. <em>Outcome: Improve trust, client conversion, and renewal success using proven external validation.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Competitive AI Landscape Analysis</strong>: Study the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft IDC MarketScape designation</a> and position Workday accordingly. <em>Outcome: Drive nuanced, multi-vendor AI conversations with clients and better inform cloud adoption strategies.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Conversational AI for Employee Service Delivery</strong>: Analyze <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/community/servicenow-ai-platform-blog/servicenow-releases-voice-agents-as-part-of-the-ai-experience/ba-p/3419367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceNow’s voice agent release</a> and map gaps/opportunities with Workday offerings. <em>Outcome: Shorten ideation-to-pilot cycles for Workday-based conversational agent pilot engagements.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Brief client leaders on leveraging Workday’s Inc. Power Partner award in active pursuits.</li>
  <li>Compile and visualize competitive AI benchmarks—Microsoft, ADP, ServiceNow—relative to Workday’s roadmap for internal reference.</li>
  <li>Schedule pre-Q3 earnings internal workshops to update playbooks based on anticipated Workday financial and product commentary.</li>
  <li>Initiate enablement micro-sessions for practitioners on integrating external accolades into pursuit, proposal, and renewal efforts.</li>
  <li>Evaluate early-stage ideas for agentic and conversational AI pilots on Workday using Extend, referencing ServiceNow’s HRSD trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Client belief that Workday AI is lagging behind peers.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Continuously communicate innovation awards, active roadmap milestones, and ecosystem differentiators.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Loss of competitive differentiation due to feature convergence among top HCM/ERP platforms.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Center advisory narratives on outcome data, external recognitions, and unique business integration capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Underestimating the impact of ServiceNow/ADP’s rapid agentic AI growth in client RFPs and project cycles.<br /><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Regularly monitor and brief client service teams on adjacent ecosystem AI shifts and update comparative collateral monthly.</li>

Power Partner, Competitive AI Moves Intensify\&quot;,\n  \&quot;priority_focus\&quot;: \&quot;Major recognition for Workday highlights ecosystem trust and performance. Leaders must monitor acceleration of agentic AI capabilities by competitors and ecosystem players, preparing for downstream effects on client AI adoption roadmaps and consulting strategies.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Recognized as a 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award Winner (Nov 5, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday’s receipt of the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Award signals a significant reaffirmation of its stature as a trusted digital transformation partner among businesses globally. The award, according to Workday’s newsroom release, acknowledges the company’s persistent delivery of value through adaptability, security, and innovation, especially amid rapid technological shifts impacting people, finance, and HR functions. The Inc. Power Partner Award, bestowed after rigorous evaluation, further elevates Workday’s positioning as a resilient and consultative software partner—the type clients increasingly demand during uncertain macroeconomic periods with high compliance and upskilling expectations.\\n\\nStrategically, this recognition builds Workday’s brand cachet and stabilizes its market perception amidst intensified competition from SAP, Oracle, and ADP, all pushing major AI and automation enhancements in 2025. For Deloitte’s Workday practice, this win bolsters client confidence, offering credentialed external validation when advising on complex, transformative SaaS moves. Additionally, it provides leverage in qualifying conversations with prospective customers who prioritize partnership integrity and ROI from HR, finance, and AI investments. The award—while not a direct measure of AI or agentic capabilities—impacts the perceived maturity and reliability of Workday’s rapidly expanding AI suite, including Skills Cloud and autonomous workflow enhancements.\\n\\nUltimately, this award is a talking point for account leaders to reinforce Workday’s differentiation in a crowded field marked by aggressive competitive announcements and marketplace volatility. It should be woven into client communications and proposal content as a proof point of Workday’s commercial and ecosystem trustworthiness.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Announces Upcoming Q3 FY2026 Financial Results Call (Nov 4, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Workday announced it will release its fiscal Q3 2026 results on November 25, 2025, via its investor newsroom. The timing is noteworthy, as it coincides with a period of robust AI marketplace activity and ecosystem-wide re-evaluation of enterprise SaaS strategies. Market analysts and consulting leaders are anticipating insights into the trajectory of Workday’s AI-driven growth segments, customer renewal rates, and adoption of new capabilities including agentic AI, skills intelligence, and Workday Extend expansion.\\n\\nFor Workday customers and Deloitte engagement leads, the upcoming earnings results and commentary are critical in benchmarking Workday’s operational health and innovation cadence against direct rivals, especially as SAP and Oracle push headline AI ecosystem moves. The Q3 call will likely offer details on pipeline confidence, competitive headwinds, and possibly early data on AI module attach rates or partner-led deployment trends. The event is also an opportunity to gauge how AI and automation themes are resonating commercially—key for shaping Q1 2026 advisory parameters and budget narratives in client engagements.\\n\\nPreparation for this call should include a readiness to synthesize takeaways for current and prospect clients, emphasizing not only the financial signals but also any forward commentary on AI marketplace launches, Skills Cloud uptake, or autonomous workflows.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://en-gb.newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-04-Workday-to-Announce-Fiscal-2026-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results-on-November-25,-2025\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft named a Leader in IDC MarketScape for AI-Enabled Large Enterprise ERP Applications (Nov 4, 2025).\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;Being named a leader signifies Microsoft&#x27;s acceleration and quality in integrating advanced AI into its ERP stack, directly targeting large enterprise transformation deals—Workday’s core market. According to their official announcement, Microsoft’s investments in copilots, agentic process automation, and business data fabric have substantially advanced operational intelligence, automating routine work and surfacing strategic insight. This heightens pressure on Workday to accelerate its own AI roadmap, especially agentic integrations in HCM and Finance, or risk market perception of lagging innovation.\\n\\nFor Deloitte and other GSI Workday advisors, this validates the need to cross-train on multi-vendor AI innovation, as clients may expect parity or best-of-breed blending across ERP landscapes. Workday teams must be prepared to articulate competitive differentiators—such as industry alignment, privacy-by-design, or seamless integration into people-focused workflows—as Microsoft’s AI leadership receives broader exposure and customer confidence. The move is a cue for go-to-market and technical leaders to adjust narratives and accelerate architecting AI-inclusive advisory offerings.\\n\\nSource: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ADP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Forrester Names ADP a Leader in 2025 HCM Wave Evaluation.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ADP’s leadership recognition by Forrester in the 2025 HCM Wave positions it as a core challenger in cloud HCM—especially for enterprise buyers exploring scalable, modular AI workflows. According to Forrester’s published analysis, ADP’s strengths include adaptive AI, extensibility, and predictive analytics, with particular momentum in payroll innovation and talent science. This escalation underscores market convergence around AI-powered platforms in HR, testing Workday’s leadership position in both functional depth and AI extensibility.\\n\\nFor Deloitte practitioners, this reinforces the imperative to highlight Workday’s differentiated solutions—such as Skills Cloud, ecosystem extensibility through Workday Extend, and responsible AI tenets. ADP’s endorsement may shape RFP criteria and trigger more competitive bake-offs, elevating the importance of outcome-led, referenceable case studies. The competitive landscape will continue to tighten, pressing Workday partners to double down on value communication and technical integration accelerators.\\n\\nSource: https://www.adp.com/resources/what-others-say/analyst-reports/forrester-named-adp-a-leader-in-hcm-wave-2025-evaluation.aspx\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow Releases Voice Agents as part of AI Experience for HR Service Delivery.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;implication\&quot;: \&quot;ServiceNow’s November 2025 release of Voice Agents for HR service delivery marks a leap in agentic AI application for employee interactions, promising to automate inquiries and transactions through natural language interfaces. The platform’s voice-first experience, detailed in their blog release, leverages context-aware AI models for authentication, case routing, and even sentiment analysis, positioning ServiceNow as an innovation driver within the HR tech segment.\\n\\nFor Workday and its advisory ecosystem, this intensifies urgency to define and communicate AI-enabled conversational agent value propositions within core HCM and Employee Experience offerings. The bar for frictionless, highly personalized, and secure service delivery using generative AI is rising. Deloitte teams should proactively brief clients on Workday’s roadmap in this area, and explore pilot architectures or integrations with the Extend platform or third-party agents, ensuring that Workday-based HR solutions remain contemporary and competitive.\\n\\nSource: https://www.servicenow.com/community/servicenow-ai-platform-blog/servicenow-releases-voice-agents-as-part-of-the-ai-experience/ba-p/3419367\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;enablement\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;AI-Driven HCM Transformation Storytelling\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-05-Workday-Recognized-as-a-2025-Inc-Power-Partner-Award-Winner\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Client engagement teams confidently leverage prestigious industry endorsements in pursuit and renewal conversations, translating brand trust into specific advisory differentiators and proposal material.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Competitive AI Landscape Analysis\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/business-leader/2025/11/04/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-ai-enabled-large-enterprise-erp-applications\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Teams provide informed perspectives in multi-vendor AI product discussions, positioning Workday’s trajectory against Microsoft, SAP, ADP, and ServiceNow to inform client strategy.\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;skill\&quot;: \&quot;Conversational AI for Employee Service Delivery\&quot;,\n      \&quot;resource_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.servicenow.com/community/servicenow-ai-platform-blog/servicenow-releases-voice-agents-as-part-of-the-ai-experience/ba-p/3419367\&quot;,\n      \&quot;90_day_outcome\&quot;: \&quot;Practitioners can identify scenarios in which Workday solutions must match or exceed conversational AI benchmarks, leading to accelerated pilot or co-innovation projects.\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;actions_next_week\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Prepare concise briefings for client stakeholders on the implications of Workday’s Inc.
