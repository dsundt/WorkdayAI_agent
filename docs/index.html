<ul>
  <li><strong>Oracle Approved by IHG Hotels & Resorts as a Property Management Provider (2026-01-29)</strong><br />
    Oracle’s formal approval by IHG Hotels & Resorts marks a critical industry-specific endorsement of Oracle’s cloud platform for property management, validating its ability to scale across a complex, global hospitality network. The announcement underscores Oracle’s persistent focus on vertical solutions, incorporating AI and cloud technology to streamline operations and boost compliance for large enterprise clients.<br />
    Strategically, this move deepens Oracle’s footprint in hospitality, leveraging its cloud suite and AI/automation capabilities to deliver tailored services and tight integration with clients’ operational HCM and finance landscapes. For Workday, this showcases how domain-adapted cloud platforms are gaining traction within major verticals—highlighting a need for even tighter vertical alignment and accelerators to remain competitive in global accounts.<br />
    For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the implication is twofold: first, vertical solutions are becoming table stakes within large sector clients; and second, being able to advise on, activate, and aggressively tailor Workday’s HCM vertical frameworks (e.g., in hospitality, healthcare, or manufacturing) will be vital for both ongoing client satisfaction and successful new pursuits.<br />

  <li><strong>Agents of change: Microsoft outlines driverless AI adoption for Canadian business transformation (2026-01-29)</strong><br />
    Microsoft Canada’s vision for AI-enabled transformation, as articulated in its ‘Agents of Change’ piece, speaks directly to the accelerating trend of enterprises committing to ‘AI-first’ operating models. The publication outlines how Canadian organizations are moving beyond piloting generative and agentic AI, instead embedding these at the heart of value delivery, workforce augmentation, and cross-functional process optimization.<br />
    This is strategically significant for Workday and its ecosystem partners for two reasons: first, it highlights how competitors are shaping a narrative where AI adoption is not merely an add-on but core to business differentiation. Second, the expansion of AI agents as trusted digital coworkers challenges HCM suite vendors (Workday included) to rapidly evolve architectures–particularly for secure, responsible, AI-augmented employee experience and data integrity.<br />
    For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these developments reinforce the need to stay close to AI maturity benchmarks, accelerate AI-focused Workday deployments, and consult clients on responsible, productivity-boosting AI integrations. Co-innovation and ecosystem partnerships will need to be presented as systemic strategies to address Canadian and wider global client needs.<br />

  <li><strong>Microsoft Data Security Index: Secure AI Adoption is Top Priority (2026-01-29)</strong><br />
    Microsoft’s latest Data Security Index reveals that for most large organizations, the secure adoption of AI technologies has become a board-level concern, driven by the dual imperatives of regulatory scrutiny and protecting business-critical data. The report details how IT and business leaders are pivoting investments into AI readiness frameworks, workforce upskilling, and comprehensive controls for GenAI and agentic AI use cases.<br />
    For the Workday ecosystem, this signals an imperative to proactively address governance, security controls, and AI explainability—especially as financial, HR, and operational data intersect in the cloud. The index implies that SaaS HCM leaders like Workday must not only demonstrate robust privacy and compliance by design but also practical enforcement of AI guardrails in live deployments.<br />
    For Deloitte, aligning advisory and implementation services to help clients translate these security needs into ongoing AI adoption—through both Workday suite and partner solutions—will be critical. Embedding secure AI practices can become a strong differentiator for both Deloitte and Workday in increasingly risk-aware client environments.<br />

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Oracle:</strong> Oracle has secured approval as a property management provider with IHG Hotels & Resorts, reinforcing its vertical market expertise in hospitality while leveraging its cloud-based AI capabilities. This development demonstrates Oracle’s ability to win major reference clients through targeted vertical cloud solutions, underpinned by AI-powered automation and integration. For Workday, the focus should shift toward developing similarly targeted industry solutions and demonstrating rapid time-to-value in hospitality and other regulated sectors. Deloitte’s Workday teams should be ready to articulate and deploy vertical IP to close differentiation gaps in these competitive pursuits.<br/>Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/news/announcement/oracle-approved-by-ihg-hotels-and-resorts-as-a-property-management-provider-2026-01-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/news/announcement/oracle-approved-by-ihg-hotels-and-resorts-as-a-property-management-provider-2026-01-29</a>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft Canada publicized its ‘Agents of Change’ strategy for AI-driven business transformation, promoting widespread agentic and generative AI adoption across operations. Microsoft’s approach underlines both the growing maturity of AI adoption in the market and the urgency for SaaS vendors (including Workday) to foster enterprise-scale, secure, and practical AI integration. Its positioning of AI as core to transformation increases pressure on Workday to expedite its own AI capabilities, integrations, and industry-focused narratives. Deloitte must continue to advocate for safe, pragmatic AI acceleration for clients while differentiating on responsible adoption and seamless migration.<br/>Source: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/microsoft-in-business/thought-leadership/2026/01/29/agents-of-change-microsoft-canadas-vision-for-ai-transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/microsoft-in-business/thought-leadership/2026/01/29/agents-of-change-microsoft-canadas-vision-for-ai-transformation</a>
  </li>
  <li><strong>ADP, Dayforce, SAP, ServiceNow:</strong> No significant new ecosystem, AI, or HCM launch activity in the past 24 hours. Existing signals underline continued investments in AI-augmented feature updates and marketplace integration but without headline competitive shifts. In the absence of major new launches, Workday and Deloitte teams should continue to monitor rolling updates but use current momentum to strengthen client-facing, AI-enabled value propositions on both innovation and risk management fronts. This period offers an opportunity to deepen client engagement on Workday’s responsible AI, verticalization, and integration stories.

Close attention is warranted on emerging responsible AI, marketplace integrations, and industry-specific HCM strategies.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle Approved by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts as a Property Management Provider (2026-01-29)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Oracle’s formal approval by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts marks a critical industry-specific endorsement of Oracle’s cloud platform for property management, validating its ability to scale across a complex, global hospitality network. The announcement underscores Oracle’s persistent focus on vertical solutions, incorporating AI and cloud technology to streamline operations and boost compliance for large enterprise clients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategically, this move deepens Oracle’s footprint in hospitality, leveraging its cloud suite and AI/automation capabilities to deliver tailored services and tight integration with clients’ operational HCM and finance landscapes. For Workday, this showcases how domain-adapted cloud platforms are gaining traction within major verticals—highlighting a need for even tighter vertical alignment and accelerators to remain competitive in global accounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Deloitte’s Workday practice, the implication is twofold: first, vertical solutions are becoming table stakes within large sector clients; and second, being able to advise on, activate, and aggressively tailor Workday’s HCM vertical frameworks (e.g., in hospitality, healthcare, or manufacturing) will be vital for both ongoing client satisfaction and successful new pursuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/news/announcement/oracle-approved-by-ihg-hotels-and-resorts-as-a-property-management-provider-2026-01-29\\\&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/news/announcement/oracle-approved-by-ihg-hotels-and-resorts-as-a-property-management-provider-2026-01-29\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Agents of change: Microsoft outlines driverless AI adoption for Canadian business transformation (2026-01-29)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft Canada’s vision for AI-enabled transformation, as articulated in its ‘Agents of Change’ piece, speaks directly to the accelerating trend of enterprises committing to ‘AI-first’ operating models. The publication outlines how Canadian organizations are moving beyond piloting generative and agentic AI, instead embedding these at the heart of value delivery, workforce augmentation, and cross-functional process optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is strategically significant for Workday and its ecosystem partners for two reasons: first, it highlights how competitors are shaping a narrative where AI adoption is not merely an add-on but core to business differentiation. Second, the expansion of AI agents as trusted digital coworkers challenges HCM suite vendors (Workday included) to rapidly evolve architectures–particularly for secure, responsible, AI-augmented employee experience and data integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these developments reinforce the need to stay close to AI maturity benchmarks, accelerate AI-focused Workday deployments, and consult clients on responsible, productivity-boosting AI integrations. Co-innovation and ecosystem partnerships will need to be presented as systemic strategies to address Canadian and wider global client needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\\\&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/microsoft-in-business/thought-leadership/2026/01/29/agents-of-change-microsoft-canadas-vision-for-ai-transformation\\\&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/microsoft-in-business/thought-leadership/2026/01/29/agents-of-change-microsoft-canadas-vision-for-ai-transformation\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft Data Security Index: Secure AI Adoption is Top Priority (2026-01-29)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Microsoft’s latest Data Security Index reveals that for most large organizations, the secure adoption of AI technologies has become a board-level concern, driven by the dual imperatives of regulatory scrutiny and protecting business-critical data. The report details how IT and business leaders are pivoting investments into AI readiness frameworks, workforce upskilling, and comprehensive controls for GenAI and agentic AI use cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Workday ecosystem, this signals an imperative to proactively address governance, security controls, and AI explainability—especially as financial, HR, and operational data intersect in the cloud. The index implies that SaaS HCM leaders like Workday must not only demonstrate robust privacy and compliance by design but also practical enforcement of AI guardrails in live deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Deloitte, aligning advisory and implementation services to help clients translate these security needs into ongoing AI adoption—through both Workday suite and partner solutions—will be critical.

The announcement underscores Oracle’s persistent focus on vertical solutions, incorporating AI and cloud technology to streamline operations and boost compliance for large enterprise clients.&lt;br /&gt;\\n    Strategically, this move deepens Oracle’s footprint in hospitality, leveraging its cloud suite and AI/automation capabilities to deliver tailored services and tight integration with clients’ operational HCM and finance landscapes.

The publication outlines how Canadian organizations are moving beyond piloting generative and agentic AI, instead embedding these at the heart of value delivery, workforce augmentation, and cross-functional process optimization.&lt;br /&gt;\\n    This is strategically significant for Workday and its ecosystem partners for two reasons: first, it highlights how competitors are shaping a narrative where AI adoption is not merely an add-on but core to business differentiation. Second, the expansion of AI agents as trusted digital coworkers challenges HCM suite vendors (Workday included) to rapidly evolve architectures–particularly for secure, responsible, AI-augmented employee experience and data integrity.&lt;br /&gt;\\n    For Deloitte’s Workday practice, these developments reinforce the need to stay close to AI maturity benchmarks, accelerate AI-focused Workday deployments, and consult clients on responsible, productivity-boosting AI integrations.

The report details how IT and business leaders are pivoting investments into AI readiness frameworks, workforce upskilling, and comprehensive controls for GenAI and agentic AI use cases.&lt;br /&gt;\\n    For the Workday ecosystem, this signals an imperative to proactively address governance, security controls, and AI explainability—especially as financial, HR, and operational data intersect in the cloud. The index implies that SaaS HCM leaders like Workday must not only demonstrate robust privacy and compliance by design but also practical enforcement of AI guardrails in live deployments.&lt;br /&gt;\\n    For Deloitte, aligning advisory and implementation services to help clients translate these security needs into ongoing AI adoption—through both Workday suite and partner solutions—will be critical.

Workday handles the official employment record, generates the offer letter, and manages payroll details.

It orchestrates the entire onboarding journey, pulling in tasks from multiple departments, sending timely reminders, and keeping the new hire informed. All those moving parts are seamlessly coordinated in one workflow. [...] After they implemented ServiceNow HRSD:\n\n Employees were provided with a unified HR portal to address all their requirements.\n Routine inquiries were promptly resolved through knowledge articles.\n HR agents were able to concentrate on more complex cases rather than responding to a multitude of emails.\n Onboarding times saw significant improvement as workflows integrated across HR, IT, and Facilities.\n\nWhile the Workday remained the system of record, the overall employee experience underwent a remarkable transformation.\n\nThe Bottom Line&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For many companies, this diamond structure can be a good choice. It can help you manage AI agents at scale, make operations nimbler, and focus people on higher-value work. But it should be a choice, not a default, because for many companies, this diamond structure can carry medium- and long-term risks. [...] If your organization is like most, it’s structured like a pyramid. A small leadership team sits at the top, supported by a larger middle tier of managers and highly trained specialists. Below them is an even larger group of employees, many of whom are recent hires, who focus on routine manual or process work. But since AI agents can take on many entry-level tasks—such as data gathering, processing, and reporting—some companies are reducing the pyramid’s “base.” They’re also repurposing the middle tier to train, oversee, and manage agents. The result is a diamond-shaped structure: a small leadership team, a strong middle layer, and a narrow base of new talent. [...] AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.&quot;,

Introduced earlier this month, the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) aims to provide a common language for agents to interact with businesses and payment processors. The protocol also works with Google&#x27;s previously announced Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), which is designed to work with both A2A and MCP servers to enable agent-made payments within a set of predefined guardrails.

The idea behind the open source protocol is that rather than text-only responses, agents should be able to generate interfaces dynamically on request. For example, if you want help booking a flight, instead of a chat interface, the agent would generate a point and click interface to walk you through the booking.\n\nIt works a bit like this: a request is sent to an agent, which generates messages describing what the UI should look like and sends them back to the client, where they&#x27;re rendered using established frameworks like Flutter or React. When the user interacts with the interface, new UI elements are generated in response.&quot;,

GitHub Copilot will first examine a project to determine whether it can update its settings to use the latest MSVC version. Microsoft described a three-step process of assessment, planning, and execution that GitHub Copilot follows for app modernization. After updating the project settings, Copilot will do an initial build to assess if there are any issues blocking the upgrade. After confirming the accuracy of the assessment with the user, Copilot will propose solutions to any issues that need to be addressed. Once the user approves the plan, the agent completes a sequence of tasks and validates that its changes resolved the identified problems. If there remains&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;BigQuery AI Hackathon: Celebrating Innovation and a Look ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;We are thrilled to announce that `AI.IF` now has a sublinear scaling capability (in Preview) which provides orders of magnitude improvement in performance. This new optimization dramatically reduces the number of calls to the large language model (LLM), resulting in queries that used to take an hour now taking just a couple of minutes.\n\nYou can sign up for the preview of this exciting new capability here.\n\nIn addition to `AI.IF`, BigQuery AI released the `AI.CLASSIFY` function, another powerful tool for AI Architects. This function simplifies text classification tasks, allowing you to, for example, automatically categorize support call logs with a single function call.\n\n### For the Semantic Detective: Unlocking deeper insights with less effort [...] By Karl Weinmeister • 7-minute read\n\nDevelopers &amp; Practitioners\n\n### How Google SREs Use Gemini CLI to Solve Real-World Outages\n\nBy Riccardo Carlesso • 9-minute read\n\nDevelopers &amp; Practitioners\n\n### Agent Factory Recap: Antigravity and Nano Banana Pro with Remik\n\nBy Vlad Kolesnikov • 4-minute read [...] ## And the Winners Are...\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce the winners of the BigQuery AI Hackathon!

[...] Agents interacting with the generated worlds can only perform a limited range of actions for now, and multiple models in the same world have trouble interacting. Genie also has trouble rendering legible text, can&#x27;t really simulate real-world locations accurately (it&#x27;s not like Google has a massive collection of 3D maps of notable locations, after all), and it says that agents sometimes lag and don&#x27;t respond properly to controls.\n\nIn addition, \&quot;A few of the Genie 3 model capabilities we announced in August, such as promptable events that change the world as you explore it, are not yet included in this prototype,\&quot; Google added.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Introducing Google Cloud Vertex AI Extensions for .NET&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;By Riccardo Carlesso • 9-minute read\n\nDevelopers &amp; Practitioners\n\n### Agent Factory Recap: Antigravity and Nano Banana Pro with Remik\n\nBy Vlad Kolesnikov • 4-minute read [...] Developers &amp; Practitioners\n\n# Introducing Google Cloud Vertex AI Extensions for .NET\n\nJanuary 29, 2026\n\n##### Mete Atamel\n\nCloud Developer Advocate\n\nIn October 2024, Microsoft announced the Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions and Microsoft.Extensions.AI libraries for .NET. These libraries provide the .NET ecosystem with essential abstractions for integrating AI services into .NET applications from various providers such as Open AI, Azure, Google.\n\nToday, we’re happy to announce the Google.Cloud.VertexAI.Extensions library. This is the Vertex AI implementation of Microsoft.Extensions.AI. This library enables .NET developers to integrate Google Gemini models on Vertex AI via the Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions. [...] ## What about the Google Gen AI .NET SDK?\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering: Doesn’t Google already have a .NET SDK for Gemini?\n\nYou’re right. There’s the Google Gen AI .NET SDK that we announced back in October 2025. Developers building applications that will only use Google as an AI provider should continue to use the Google Gen AI .NET SDK. Developers building applications that may use different AI providers (Google, OpenAI, Azure ...) will benefit from the Google.Cloud.VertexAI.Extensions library.\n\n## Samples\n\nNow that we understand the context, let’s take a look at some samples. \n\n### Microsoft.Extensions.AI with Ollama\n\nBefore we look into Google.Cloud.VertexAI.Extensions, let’s actually look at the hello world chat sample with Ollama.\n\nLet’s take a look at the details.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In software development, for example, you may no longer need teams of people at work in each stage: generating solution architecture and user stories, creating test cases and test scripts, or troubleshooting, reviewing, and documenting. One experienced software engineer can orchestrate teams of AI agents at work in many or even all stages.\n\nAs they shift from narrow execution to broader responsibility, these engineers—and other specialized, high-value employees like them—can become generalists: working across more processes, making faster decisions, and focusing on bottom-line impact.\n\n## If you&#x27;re not building your organization with early-career talent, you may be missing out [...] ## Six ways to begin\n\nThe organizations that are successful with AI typically aren’t starting at the edges. They’re starting at the top. Leadership identifies a few high-impact areas for investment, sets a clear strategy, and guides a focused path to value. That can include building a user-friendly orchestration layer to help create and manage workflows and focusing on Responsible AI to enhance performance and grow stakeholder trust.\n\nBut strategy alone likely won&#x27;t deliver outcomes. Here’s how you can get started.\n\n### Enter the future of work with AI\n\nA new era of agentic work is revolutionizing business\n\nLearn more\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nShebani Patel\n\nWorkforce Solutions Practice Leader, PwC US\n\nEmail\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nBrad Herndon\n\nPrincipal, Sales, Service and Marketing, PwC US\n\nEmail [...] New skills and focus can remake the function. HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;output; it penalizes those in rigidly designed jobs, such as nar-rowly scripted clerical or call-center work. Blanket retraining schemes don’t account for these nuances. Large-scale retraining programs have a mixed record, even when dis-placement is real. When displace-ment is overstated, such programs risk doing harm. They pull workers out of productive roles, subsidize credentials with little demonstrated labor-market value, and signal panic to firms and households alike. That panic can become self-reinforcing: companies delay hiring, workers de-lay investment in firm-specific skills, and productivity-enhancing reorganization slows. The result is a policy-induced drag on growth and adaptation. AI will disrupt labor markets, but disruption isn’t synonymous with de-struction. The danger [...] to be reorga-nized. Technology automates, accel-erates or reduces the cost of specific tasks within a job, allowing employ-ees to spend more time on higher-value activities. As a result, output expands and wages often rise. Soft-ware developers, for instance, rou-tinely use AI tools to generate boiler-plate code, test functions and debug routines—tasks that once consumed hours. The result isn’t fewer develop-ers, but developers producing more-complex systems faster, with demand for experienced talent rising rather than falling. As technology accelerates tasks and reduces costs, companies also create roles that task-based rankings like those from Goldman Sachs and the OECD cannot see. Law firms in-creasingly rely on litigation-support managers and AI-review specialists who oversee [...] initiatives on the premise that mass white-collar layoffs are imminent. Federal workforce initiatives, includ-ing AI-focused retraining grants lay-ered onto existing programs such as the Workforce Innovation and Op-portunity Act, increasingly assume occupational collapse rather than within-job adaptation. But if AI pri-marily augments tasks rather than replaces jobs, this approach misses the mark. Workers don’t need to be rescued from their professions; they need room to adapt within them. This is where retraining could help—but only if it is targeted. While AI won’t destroy occupations in the manner politicians imagine, some workers will adapt more easily than others. AI rewards those with judg-ment, domain knowledge and ma-chine output; it penalizes those in rigidly designed jobs, such&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Whether through partnership or acquisition, both approaches point to the same truth. “Private markets are where much of the innovation is happening,” Niamh observes, “but they require a different kind of resilience.”\n\nWhen the conversation pivots to artificial intelligence, all three agree that its potential is enormous, but so are the responsibilities that come with it.\n\n“Of course, AI is really important,” Prendergast points out, “but it comes with significant considerations: regulatory compliance, legal considerations, data privacy, confidentiality. We also have to consider third-party oversight, and ethics and ensure our people feel empowered to use these tools responsibly.” [...] “We’re bringing AI to our boards on a regular basis,” adds McMahon, “and asking our service providers to present to us on their AI offerings. It carries huge potential in terms of scale and efficiency, but there are operational challenges too, getting people comfortable with it, bringing boards on the journey. People have to be encouraged and trained responsibly, with policies and guardrails. But the potential is extraordinary.”\n\n“AI has the power to enhance human judgment rather than replace it,” Geraghty agrees. “Firms that succeed are those that pair technological fluency with emotional intelligence as this is essential to the next generation of leadership.” [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog&quot;,

With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes.

Learn More. [...] After processing hundreds of jobs, the agent develops intuition about patterns: Small datasets with few categories require fewer workstations, while large datasets with many categories need more. The agent remembers every experiment perfectly, never forgets lessons learned, and automatically applies this accumulated wisdom to new workloads, essentially transforming months of expert tuning experience into intelligence that&#x27;s immediately available, 24/7. Rather than requiring engineers to reconfigure the system every time data characteristics change, the agent becomes smarter with every job it processes. [...] Formally, RL can be described as an AI agent interacting with an environment, sensing its state, taking actions, and receiving rewards as shown in Figure 2. Over time, the agent learns a policy (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes expected long-term reward.\n\nIn this article, the RL agent observes dataset characteristics, tries different partition counts, measures performance, and gradually builds knowledge about which configurations work best for which data patterns. After repeated executions, the agent develops intuition comparable to that of an experienced engineer and automatically selects the correct number of partitions for different workloads.\n\n/filters:no_upscale()/articles/agent-reinforcement-learning-apache-spark/en/resources/80figure-4-1769432233814.jpg)&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Immediate for ADP Vantage HCM® | ADP Marketplace&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;ImmediatePay&#x27;s shift validator feature is an automated system that uses AI to analyze and profile each employee&#x27;s standard shift patterns. This system monitors for any discrepancies in time entries and wages to ensure the accuracy of data.  \n     \n   Unlike conventional practices where time verification only occurs at the end of the pay period, ImmediatePay proactively validates shift information so that your managers don’t need to. This approach ensures that earned wages are calculated precisely and made available promptly, without the need for additional administrative efforts or altering the existing workflow within an organization. This seamless integration upholds operational efficiency and minimizes discrepancies, safeguarding both employer and employee interests. [...] ## Commitment to Responsible AI\n\nTogether with ADP Marketplace, our company is committed to the responsible use of AI. When incorporating AI into our product(s), we have agreed to comply with ADP Marketplace&#x27;s AI principles focused on human oversight, monitoring, privacy, explainability, transparency, and mitigating bias. Learn more here.\n\n### How we use AI [...] With the Immediate and ADP Vantage HCM® integration, customers can easily implement the Immediate earned wage access (EWA) solution. Our approach to earned wage access does not disrupt a company&#x27;s payroll or time tracking process and Immediate is a zero-cost benefit to the employer. With the ADP Vantage HCM® integration, your team can begin offering EWA in as little as one hour. When the workday ends, Immediate&#x27;s AI compares employee shift history with new work log items to verify time worked. Team members then have access to their earned but not yet paid wages through the ImmediatePay app. The integration with ADP Vantage HCM® allows Immediate to see real-time data and provide an automatic deduction file for the next pay period. Immediate is then reimbursed through the payroll process.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Amazon Bedrock Agents manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation behind the scenes. By enabling agents to work together, you can achieve higher task success rates, accuracy, and enhanced productivity. In internal benchmark testing, multi-agent collaboration has shown marked improvements compared to single-agent systems for handling complex, multi-step tasks. [...] With the fully managed multi-agent collaboration capability on Amazon Bedrock, specialized agents work within their domains of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization. [...] I select the content-strategist agent and provide the collaborator name `content-strategist` along with the following instruction:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media content strategy tasks such as converting business goals into engaging social posts. The agent generates creative, on-brand content ideas that align with specified campaign goals and target audience.`\n\nThen, I choose Add collaborator, select the engagement-predictor agent, and provide the collaborator name `engagement-predictor` along with the following instructions:\n\n`You can invoke this agent for social media analytics to predict post performance and optimal timing.`&quot;,

This new capability allows you to tackle more intricate, multi-step workflows and scale your AI-driven applications more effectively. [...] Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration GA introduces key enhancements designed to improve scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency. Inline Agents allow you to dynamically adjust agent roles and behaviors at runtime, making workflows more adaptable as your business needs evolve. With Payload Referencing, supervisor agents can reference linked data instead of embedding it in every request, reducing data transfer, improving response times, and lowering operational costs. Additionally, multi-agent now offers CloudFormation (CFN) and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) support so you can create reusable teams of agents as templates that can be shared across accounts within an organization. [...] This release also introduces agent monitoring and observability features, helping you track, monitor, and optimize agent interactions more efficiently. These features improve debugging and traceability, ensuring better visibility into agent workflows and making troubleshooting easier for developers.\n\nMulti-agent collaboration on Amazon Bedrock is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AWS brings multi-agent orchestration to Bedrock | VentureBeat&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“Using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock, customers can get more accurate results by creating and assigning specialized agents for specific steps of a project and accelerate tasks by orchestrating multiple agents working in parallel,” AWS said.\n\nCustomers build their specialized agents on Bedrock, and then make a supervisor or orchestrator agent to help manage the other agents. AWS said the supervisor agent “handles the coordination, like breaking up and routing tasks to the right agents, giving specific agents access to the information they need to complete their work and determining what actions can be processed in parallel.” [...] AWS first introduced agentic capabilities in 2023 with the release of Agents on Bedrock, which offered enterprises a way to start building agents. During its re:Invent event this week, AWS customers like PagerDuty and GitLab announced new agents that let users develop their applications on their platforms and use AWS agents to enhance their workflows.\n\n## Multiple agents becoming the norm [...] All Posts\n\n# AWS brings multi-agent orchestration to Bedrock\n\nEmilia David\n\nAWS is doubling down on AI agents with the announcement of multiagent capabilities on its Amazon Bedrock platform.\n\nDuring his keynote at the AWS re:Invent conference, AWS CEO Matt Garman said customers building agents on Bedrock wanted a means to make agents that work together.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team. [...] AI agents are opening the door to a fundamentally different role for IT. Instead of being the team that responds to business needs, IT can become the team that helps shape them—designing intelligent workflows, managing AI systems, and accelerating innovation. But realizing this opportunity depends on making intentional changes to focus, roles, and structure. Here’s what CIOs should know:\n\n### AI-enabled marketing: Anticipating customer behavior and fostering creativity [...] AI is transforming marketing into a proactive driver of growth. With AI agents handling tasks across content, campaigns, planning, and analytics, marketers can focus on creativity, strategy, and customer connection. In this new model, humans can bring empathy and brand insight while AI delivers precision and scale. Together, they can create faster, more personalized, and more effective experiences with insights and optimization opportunities identified proactively rather than reactively. Here’s what CMOs should know:\n\n### AI-enabled HR: Building a more capable and nimbler workforce&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ERP finance transformation and internal controls in FSI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] ##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management. [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team. [...] New skills and focus can remake the function. HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin [...] For many companies, this diamond structure can be a good choice. It can help you manage AI agents at scale, make operations nimbler, and focus people on higher-value work. But it should be a choice, not a default, because for many companies, this diamond structure can carry medium- and long-term risks.&quot;,

Nonetheless, Workday (and HiredScore, prior to Workday’s acquisition of HiredScore) routinely conducts bias testing of its AI products that have the potential to significantly impact individuals’ economic opportunities. While Workday engaged an external consultant to conduct the bias testing of the Spotlight AI tool using the impact ratio approach as described in the NYC Law, the purpose of this testing is in furtherance of Workday/HiredScore’s commitments to identify and mitigate potential bias. Customers may need to conduct their own evaluation, testing and/or bias audits depending on their legal obligations. [...] HiredScore’s explainable AI outputs report to what extent a candidate’s application matches the job requirements using a simple A, B, C, D system, where A denotes the highest match between a candidate’s application and an employer-defined job requisition. Put another way, the technology acts like a “smart mirror” reflecting back the extent to which candidates fit the job requirements set by the employer. The A, B, C, D scores are never “curved.” This means that if a job requisition has commonly held requirements, there may be many more As and Bs than Cs and Ds. Conversely, if a job requisition has very uncommonly held requirements, there may be many more Cs and Ds than As and Bs, and each candidate will receive a score indicating how they align with the requirements; this score is [...] Designing and building responsible AI that our customers can trust and adopt in line with their legal compliance obligations has been part of HiredScore’s mission statement since the beginning. We take responsible AI very seriously and regularly work with outside experts in AI, data privacy, employment law, and responsible AI to ensure adherence to best practices and the highest standards.\n\n## Overview of HiredScore AI Functionality&quot;,

[...] With AI best practices and technical standards continuing to mature, the AI RMF is an essential benchmark for AI developers and deployers. Workday uses the AI RMF to assess and refine our responsible AI practices and to communicate the rigor of our AI governance approach to our enterprise customers. With leaders in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Singapore, and elsewhere taking action to promote trustworthy AI, the AI RMF is a common language to understand the expectations and requirements of AI governance.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Oracle Cloud HCM vs. Workday: 5 things to know | oraclehcm&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Given that Workday’s 24 R2 release is scheduled for September 2024, it should just barely make its own timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle Cloud HCM made a clear announcement regarding its generative AI plans and use cases in June 2023. As of its first release in 2024, Oracle Cloud HCM customers have had access to embedded generative AI functionality that help customers improve decision making and enhance the employee experience. These include knowledgebase articles, job postings, performance feedback and development tips, and review summaries. It also includes many use cases that Workday has not announced on its roadmap, like a candidate experience summary, job category landing pages, and job match explanations. [...] Then co-CEO Carl Eschenbach first discussed preliminary plans for generative AI in March 2023. Workday’s generative AI use cases were clarified at Workday Rising in September 2023, talking about functionality such as job descriptions and employee growth plans. Plans for availability were set for 6-12 months from the event, or between March and September 2024. As of March 2024, Workday confirmed that there were three HCM use cases in an early adopter program as of its 24 R1 release, with none scheduled for general availability until the 24 R2 release or later. Workday subsequently put a fourth HCM use case into early adopter program during its DevCon 2024 event, with no clear plans for general availability. [...] Overall, Workday only has 25 generative AI use cases on its roadmap, while Oracle Fusion Applications have 50+ embedded use cases.\n\nThe innovation comparison is substantial. While Oracle Cloud HCM customers are benefiting from increased productivity, Workday users are made to wait.\n\n## 4. Deliver a personalized and meaningful experience to every employee&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In _Superagency_, Hoffman argues that new risks naturally accompany new capabilities—meaning they should be managed but not necessarily eliminated.15 Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato, _Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future_, Authors Equity, January 28, 2025. Leaders need to contend with external threats, such as infringement on intellectual property (IP), AI-enabled malware, and internal threats that arise from the AI adoption process. The first step in building fit-for-purpose risk managementis to launch a comprehensive assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities in each of a company’s businesses. Leaders can then establish a robust governance structure, implement real-time monitoring and control mechanisms, and ensure continuous training and adherence to [...] Achieving AI superagency in the workplace is not simply about mastering technology. It is every bit as much about supporting people, creating processes, and managing governance. The next chapters explore the nontechnological factors that will help shape the deployment of AI in the workplace.\n\nChapter 2 [...] Beyond LLMs, other forms of AI and machine learning (ML) are improving explainability, allowing the outputs of models that support consequential decisions (for example, credit risk assessment) to be traced back to the data that informed them. In this way, critical systems can be tested and monitored on a near-constant basis for bias and other everyday harms that arise from model drift and shifting data inputs, which happens even in systems that were well calibrated before deployment.\n\nAll of this is crucial for detecting errors and ensuring compliance with regulations and company policies. Companies have improved explainability practicesand built necessary checks and balances, but they must be prepared to evolve continuously to keep up with growing model capabilities.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“We’re bringing AI to our boards on a regular basis,” adds McMahon, “and asking our service providers to present to us on their AI offerings. It carries huge potential in terms of scale and efficiency, but there are operational challenges too, getting people comfortable with it, bringing boards on the journey. People have to be encouraged and trained responsibly, with policies and guardrails. But the potential is extraordinary.”\n\n“AI has the power to enhance human judgment rather than replace it,” Geraghty agrees. “Firms that succeed are those that pair technological fluency with emotional intelligence as this is essential to the next generation of leadership.” [...] Whether through partnership or acquisition, both approaches point to the same truth. “Private markets are where much of the innovation is happening,” Niamh observes, “but they require a different kind of resilience.”\n\nWhen the conversation pivots to artificial intelligence, all three agree that its potential is enormous, but so are the responsibilities that come with it.\n\n“Of course, AI is really important,” Prendergast points out, “but it comes with significant considerations: regulatory compliance, legal considerations, data privacy, confidentiality. We also have to consider third-party oversight, and ethics and ensure our people feel empowered to use these tools responsibly.” [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ERP finance transformation and internal controls in FSI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2 [...] ##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management.&quot;,

Fines for customs violations can be staggering, but involvement of the Department of Justice can escalate the consequences to criminal charges for white-collar crime, affecting individuals and the enterprise&#x27;s standing.\n\nThe investment in robust internal auditing, cross-departmental collaboration, and technological automation is a mandatory risk-mitigation strategy. As the enforcement ramp-up of 2026 begins, the time for merely reacting is over: Proactive compliance is the new fiscal imperative.\n\nWorkday and FT Longitude \&quot;C-Suite Global AI Indicator Report,\&quot; with a photo of a professional or executive.\n\nReport&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit \n\nImage 8: Employee segments differ, but all indicate a high familiarity with gen AI.\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views. [...] Image description ends.\n\n### Leaders can invest more in their employees\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nWho is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees\n\nOur research looked at people who self-identify as “Zoomers,” “Bloomers,” “Gloomers,” and “Doomers” in their attitudes toward AI—a set of archetypes introduced in _Superagency_. We find that 39 percent of employees identify as Bloomers, who are AI optimists that want to collaborate with their companies to create responsible solutions. Meanwhile, 37 percent identify as Gloomers, who are more skeptical about AI and want extensive top-down AI regulations; 20 percent identify as Zoomers, who want AI to be quickly deployed with few guardrails; and just 4 percent identify as Doomers, who have a fundamentally negative view of AI (exhibit). [...] Image description ends.\n\nSidebar\n\nGlobal perspectives on training\n\nTo get a clearer picture of global AI adoption trends, we looked at trends across five countries: Australia, India, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Broadly speaking, these employees and C-suite leaders—the “international” group in this report—have similar views of AI as their US peers. In some key areas, however, including the topic of training, their experiences differ.&quot;,

It moves freely across families, communities, and generations. Yet for decades, the science fighting cancer has been constrained by silos. Data locked inside institutions. Research slowed by privacy barriers. Breakthroughs limited by the inability to see across the full landscape of disease. [...] By connecting data across institutions:\n\nThe long-term ambition extends even further. The goal is not only better treatment, but earlier detection and true prevention, enabled by large-scale pattern recognition across populations.\n\nThis is how discovery begins to move upstream.\n\nThe work no one sees, but everyone depends on\n\nOne of the most important truths about transformation is this. It is built on foundations that rarely make headlines.\n\nCommon data models. Governance frameworks. Security architectures. Regulatory approvals. Executive sign-offs. Hundreds of people aligned across multiple institutions.  \n  \nThis is slow, meticulous, unglamorous work. It is also the work that makes everything else possible. [...] At the heart of this effort is federated learning, a privacy-preserving approach to artificial intelligence that allows institutions to collaborate without ever sharing raw patient data.\n\nInstead of moving sensitive data into a centralized system, each cancer center keeps full control of its data within its own secure environment. AI models train locally. Only encrypted model insights move across the network.  \n  \nThis can preserve:\n\nAt the same time, it can unlock shared intelligence across institutions that would otherwise never be possible.\n\nThis is not simply a technical advance. It is a trust architecture. And trust is what makes scale possible.\n\nFrom isolated projects to a shared innovation engine&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ERP finance transformation and internal controls in FSI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management. [...] Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency [...] Even those with a skeptical take on AI are familiar with it; 94 percent of Gloomers and 71 percent of Doomers say they have some familiarity with gen AI tools. Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of Gloomers and about half of Doomers say they are comfortable using gen AI at work.\n\nExhibit \n\nImage 8: Employee segments differ, but all indicate a high familiarity with gen AI.\n\nImage descriptions begins:\n\nThe exhibit depicts US employee sentiment toward gen AI, categorized into four archetypes: Doomer, Gloomer, Bloomer, and Zoomer. Each archetype&#x27;s perspective is presented through a series of semicircular sunray charts showing the share of respondents within each group holding specific views.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

But the potential is extraordinary.”\n\n“AI has the power to enhance human judgment rather than replace it,” Geraghty agrees. “Firms that succeed are those that pair technological fluency with emotional intelligence as this is essential to the next generation of leadership.” [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nImpact Report 2025\n\n### Impact Report 2025\n\nIlluminating the Future of AI in Irish Business\n\n### Illuminating the Future of AI in Irish Business&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ERP finance transformation and internal controls in FSI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] ##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management. [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2&quot;,

Fines for customs violations can be staggering, but involvement of the Department of Justice can escalate the consequences to criminal charges for white-collar crime, affecting individuals and the enterprise&#x27;s standing.\n\nThe investment in robust internal auditing, cross-departmental collaboration, and technological automation is a mandatory risk-mitigation strategy. As the enforcement ramp-up of 2026 begins, the time for merely reacting is over: Proactive compliance is the new fiscal imperative.\n\nWorkday and FT Longitude \&quot;C-Suite Global AI Indicator Report,\&quot; with a photo of a professional or executive.\n\nReport&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] ##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management. [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2&quot;,

That’s a little more difficult to gauge; they’re close-lipped about it, indicating a wider problem, Williams noted. “Senior executives often don’t want to admit they are using AI,” he said. Instead, they’re trying to prove how valuable they are without disclosing their own AI use.\n\nJust like workers elsewhere in the enterprise, “senior leaders are able to get more done faster than ever” with AI, he noted. For instance, he said, “you can draft a legal contract in seconds and get a lawyer to review, rather than spend weeks drafting and redrafting using external counsel.” [...] ### From our editors straight to your inbox\n\nTaryn Plumb is a freelance writer specializing in AI and cybersecurity.

When Microsoft rotates certificates, if the new certificates do not include the necessary intermediate certificates, clients may not be able to establish a trusted connection. This can lead to users being unable to log into applications that rely on these certificates, such as Workday.

You may need to check the configuration of the certificate on your server and ensure that it is trusted by the client systems accessing it. If the certificate is self-signed or issued by a private CA, it may not be trusted by the client systems, leading to the errors you are seeing.\n\nFor more information on troubleshooting SSL certificate trust issues, you can refer to the relevant Microsoft documentation.\n\n&#x27; cx=&#x27;32&#x27; cy=&#x27;32&#x27; r=&#x27;32&#x27; /%3E%3Ctext x=&#x27;50%25&#x27; y=&#x27;55%25&#x27; dominant-baseline=&#x27;middle&#x27; text-anchor=&#x27;middle&#x27; fill=&#x27;%23FFF&#x27; %3EVV%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nPlease let us know who will need to update these intermediate certificates&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Shadow AI by the numbers\n\nThe survey of 2,000 workers at companies with more than 500 employees found that shadow AI is rampant, and not much is being done to rein it in. Of those surveyed, 86% said they use AI on a weekly basis at work, the most common use cases being in technical support, sales (such as email marketing), and contracts. But more than one-third of them admitted to using the free versions of company-approved tools, raising questions about where sensitive corporate data is being stored and processed.\n\nFurthermore: [...] ### Salesforce’s Agentforce 360 gets an enterprise data backbone with Informatica’s metadata and lineage engine\n\n### The hot issues for CIOs at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\n\n### What CIOs can learn at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\n\n### What Oracle’s $300B OpenAI deal means for enterprise cloud strategy\n\n### Legacy federal government HR systems: A billion dollar problem, says Workday survey\n\n## Show me more\n\n### The CIO’s new frontier: Architecting the intent-driven future of work\n\nImage\n\n### AI agent evaluations: The hidden cost of deployment\n\nImage\n\n### 5 key questions about the CIO AI agenda in 2026\n\nImage\n\n### CIO Leadership Live ASEAN: Governance at Machine Speed-Gambling Regulatory Authority of Singapore’s CIO on Compliance, Harm Minimization, and AI\n\nImage [...] Concerningly, when it comes to the tools workers are using, free versions tend to be the most popular. More than half (58%) of employees using non-approved tools rely on free versions, and 34% of those working at companies that do allow AI tools are also opting for the free version.\n\n“Non-paid is almost certainly worse because of the licensing and business models around them,” said Williams. “There is always a cost to using free tools; in this case it’s the value of your data.”\n\nAnd employees are not shy about loading sensitive data into unsanctioned AI tools: 33% admit to sharing enterprise research or datasets; 27% to revealing employee data (such as salary or performance tracking); 23% to inputting company financial information.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In software development, for example, you may no longer need teams of people at work in each stage: generating solution architecture and user stories, creating test cases and test scripts, or troubleshooting, reviewing, and documenting. One experienced software engineer can orchestrate teams of AI agents at work in many or even all stages.\n\nAs they shift from narrow execution to broader responsibility, these engineers—and other specialized, high-value employees like them—can become generalists: working across more processes, making faster decisions, and focusing on bottom-line impact.\n\n## If you&#x27;re not building your organization with early-career talent, you may be missing out [...] If your organization is like most, it’s structured like a pyramid. A small leadership team sits at the top, supported by a larger middle tier of managers and highly trained specialists. Below them is an even larger group of employees, many of whom are recent hires, who focus on routine manual or process work. But since AI agents can take on many entry-level tasks—such as data gathering, processing, and reporting—some companies are reducing the pyramid’s “base.” They’re also repurposing the middle tier to train, oversee, and manage agents. The result is a diamond-shaped structure: a small leadership team, a strong middle layer, and a narrow base of new talent. [...] If your company is based on knowledge work, reducing early-career workers could limit apprenticeship and starve your organization of its future: You won&#x27;t be developing the high-performing generalists and business leaders (with experience in your unique processes) who could fill your upper ranks and be your differential. For these knowledge-intensive firms, an hourglass structure—which we’re building in-house at PwC—can be a better choice. Here, entry-level roles can expand as AI-literate, business-savvy, and change-ready employees ramp up quickly, so they can contribute at a high level across workflows. Experienced specialists can expand their reach, combining their creativity, experience, and strategic insight with the scale and speed of AI agents.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ERP finance transformation and internal controls in FSI&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Leveraging ERP system accelerator and AI technology to develop intelligent controls boosts efficiency and confidence that risks are addressed. Generative AI, autonomous agents, robotic process automation (RPA), and machine learning can strategically update accounting, IT, governance, and operational controls. Examples include intelligent access and segregation controls, real-time integration monitoring, audit and SOX readiness, machine learning for risk assessment and predictive analytics, and ongoing improvement via AI-driven feedback and insights.\n\n##### Consequences of inadequate controls [...] ##### Keeping pace with rising FSI industry challenges\n\nToday’s financial services organizations face increasing pressure to modernize their ERP technology stacks in response to shifting industry demands—including evolving consumer preferences, rapid product innovation using AI and blockchain, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Banks now accommodate stablecoin payments and deposits, wealth managers use AI for asset management, real estate firms are starting to offer fractional property investments via tokenization, and insurers are leveraging AI for both fraud detection and fee-based risk management. [...] Ironically, the same technologies that can reduce risk—digital transactions, AI, and cloud computing—can also introduce new and sometimes unforeseen vulnerabilities. With the rapid rise of cloud computing, more FSI organizations are migrating on-premises ERP systems to the cloud.1 In the process, they may face challenges specific to the cloud and cloud migration process. A recent Forbes survey found that 31% of financial services firms worldwide are concerned about cybersecurity threats from cloud-based sources.2&quot;,

When Microsoft rotates certificates, if the new certificates do not include the necessary intermediate certificates, clients may not be able to establish a trusted connection. This can lead to users being unable to log into applications that rely on these certificates, such as Workday.

You may need to check the configuration of the certificate on your server and ensure that it is trusted by the client systems accessing it. If the certificate is self-signed or issued by a private CA, it may not be trusted by the client systems, leading to the errors you are seeing.\n\nFor more information on troubleshooting SSL certificate trust issues, you can refer to the relevant Microsoft documentation.\n\n&#x27; cx=&#x27;32&#x27; cy=&#x27;32&#x27; r=&#x27;32&#x27; /%3E%3Ctext x=&#x27;50%25&#x27; y=&#x27;55%25&#x27; dominant-baseline=&#x27;middle&#x27; text-anchor=&#x27;middle&#x27; fill=&#x27;%23FFF&#x27; %3EVV%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nPlease let us know who will need to update these intermediate certificates&quot;,

When Microsoft rotates certificates, if the new certificates do not include the necessary intermediate certificates, clients may not be able to establish a trusted connection.

You may need to check the configuration of the certificate on your server and ensure that it is trusted by the client systems accessing it.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI is the latest in a series of transformative supertools, including the steam engine, internet, and smartphone, that have reshaped our world by amplifying human capabilities. Like its predecessors, AI can democratize access to knowledge and automate tasks, assuming humans can develop and deploy it safely and equitably. [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”). [...] Many breakthrough technologies, including the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing, have transformed the way we live and work. AI stands out from these inventions because it offers more than access to information. It can summarize, code, reason, engage in a dialogue, and make choices. AI can lower skill barriers, helping more people acquire proficiency in more fields, in any language and at any time. AI holds the potential to shift the way people access and use knowledge. The result will be more efficient and effective problem solving, enabling innovation that benefits everyone.\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nAI superagency&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In software development, for example, you may no longer need teams of people at work in each stage: generating solution architecture and user stories, creating test cases and test scripts, or troubleshooting, reviewing, and documenting. One experienced software engineer can orchestrate teams of AI agents at work in many or even all stages.\n\nAs they shift from narrow execution to broader responsibility, these engineers—and other specialized, high-value employees like them—can become generalists: working across more processes, making faster decisions, and focusing on bottom-line impact.\n\n## If you&#x27;re not building your organization with early-career talent, you may be missing out [...] If your organization is like most, it’s structured like a pyramid. A small leadership team sits at the top, supported by a larger middle tier of managers and highly trained specialists. Below them is an even larger group of employees, many of whom are recent hires, who focus on routine manual or process work. But since AI agents can take on many entry-level tasks—such as data gathering, processing, and reporting—some companies are reducing the pyramid’s “base.” They’re also repurposing the middle tier to train, oversee, and manage agents. The result is a diamond-shaped structure: a small leadership team, a strong middle layer, and a narrow base of new talent. [...] If your company is based on knowledge work, reducing early-career workers could limit apprenticeship and starve your organization of its future: You won&#x27;t be developing the high-performing generalists and business leaders (with experience in your unique processes) who could fill your upper ranks and be your differential. For these knowledge-intensive firms, an hourglass structure—which we’re building in-house at PwC—can be a better choice. Here, entry-level roles can expand as AI-literate, business-savvy, and change-ready employees ramp up quickly, so they can contribute at a high level across workflows. Experienced specialists can expand their reach, combining their creativity, experience, and strategic insight with the scale and speed of AI agents.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team.

HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Организациите, които предприемат действия още сега за модернизиране на инфраструктурата и за развитие на уменията на своята работна сила, са в по‑добра позиция да оформят следващия етап от корпоративните изчислителни технологии. Напредъкът в специализираните чипове, високоскоростните мрежи и интелигентното управление на работните натоварвания се превръща в основа за мащабното прилагане на AI.\n\nХибридните изчисления се превръщат в стратегически императив [...] Workforce transformation and sustainability become core focus areas\n\nThe infrastructure transformation required to support AI at scale also demands significant workforce reskilling. IT teams must evolve from managing traditional servers to operating GPU clusters, high-bandwidth networks and advanced cooling systems. Network architects need to design for AI-specific traffic patterns, while cost engineers must develop expertise in\n\nhybrid compute portfolio optimization and inference economics. [...] “The infrastructure many enterprises have today was designed for the pre-AI era,” said Aleksandar Ganchev, Director Technology Strategy Transformation. “No enterprise could reasonably have been expected to have designed their architecture for something that didn’t exist at the time. Very quickly, most infrastructure capacity will be dedicated to AI systems rather than traditional workloads.”\n\nThis shift is accelerating the emergence of so-called “AI factories” – purpose-built environments that integrate AI-optimized hardware, high-performance networking, data pipelines and unified orchestration platforms. These environments are designed to support multimodal AI workloads efficiently, reduce architectural risk and enable faster deployment at scale.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Education is another sector where generative AI could prove particularly useful, helping teachers customise learning materials and experiences for their students. However, developing adequate policies and competences is essential to support the integration of generative AI in the education system.\n\nNew business models prompted by generative AI are emerging in the manufacturing sector. For example, the new generative AI model, the agentic AI, allows the autonomous management of production tasks, automating processes, optimising supply chain or reducing waste, overall leading to improved efficiency.\n\nThe shifts in the labour market and AI-related skills [...] The shifts in the labour market and AI-related skills\n\nGenerative AI is shifting labour market dynamics. Doctors, teachers, engineers and other high-skill professions are being impacted more by generative AI than previous technological innovations. For example, a JRC study found that teachers were more exposed to AI than 90% of other occupations.\n\nGenerative AI is also causing a shift in the demand of skills, highlighting an increased need for transversal skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and digital skills related to the development and maintenance of AI systems.\n\nImpacts on social groups and inequalities [...] How generative AI supports different economic sectors\n\nGenerative AI could bring considerable productivity gains, especially in high-skill professions. The report analyses how generative AI is impacting specific sectors.\n\nFor example healthcare, where generative AI could help face the pressure of an aging population and workforce shortages. Generative AI can be used for personalised medicine, the prevention and early diagnosis of diseases, or the creation of coherent overviews from fragmented medical information. The high potential of generative AI in healthcare is reflected in the large share of activity in the EU, which accounts for almost 10% of the total generative AI research, innovation, and business activities.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hybrid computing becomes a strategic imperative\n\nFor many enterprises, the operational expense of AI has become a catalyst for significant change. Some organizations are already facing monthly AI compute costs in the tens of millions, especially as agentic AI systems move into production. At the same time, regulatory expectations around data residency, the need for ultra-low latency in real-time use cases such as manufacturing or autonomous systems and resilience requirements for mission-critical applications are reshaping infrastructure decisions. [...] За много предприятия оперативните разходи за AI се превърнаха в катализатор за съществени промени. Някои организации вече се сблъскват с месечни разходи за AI изчисления в размер на десетки милиони, особено с навлизането на агентни AI системи в реална производствена среда. В същото време регулаторните изисквания за местонахождение на данните, нуждата от изключително ниска латентност при приложения в реално време като производство или автономни системи, както и изискванията за устойчивост на критично важни приложения, променят начина, по който се вземат инфраструктурни решения. [...] Организациите, които предприемат действия още сега за модернизиране на инфраструктурата и за развитие на уменията на своята работна сила, са в по‑добра позиция да оформят следващия етап от корпоративните изчислителни технологии. Напредъкът в специализираните чипове, високоскоростните мрежи и интелигентното управление на работните натоварвания се превръща в основа за мащабното прилагане на AI.\n\nХибридните изчисления се превръщат в стратегически императив&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Originally developed by Google, A2A also uses a client-server architecture along with many of the same messaging and transport protocols as MCP. But rather than talking to tools or data stores, A2A is designed explicitly to facilitate the discovery of other agents, and the communication between them.\n\nThe idea here is that agents may work as a team to solve a problem or perform a task. As we&#x27;ve previously discussed, depending on the complexity of the task, it may make more sense to have multiple agents that each perform a smaller piece of it, rather than one monolithic agent trying to do it all.

In at least one scenario, OpenAI&#x27;s shopping agent decided that spending $31 on a dozen eggs was a totally reasonable expense.\n\nAnd, as nice as it might be to have an agent that restocks your sundries when you&#x27;re actually running low instead of on a set schedule, nobody is going to be happy when the agent decides ordering a lifetime supply of single ply toilet paper is a good idea. AP2 aims to prevent these kinds of missteps.\n\n### Everything else\n\nAlongside a growing number of agentic protocols competing for industry adoption are all the other frameworks and tools used to actually build and deploy the agents on which they&#x27;re based.&quot;,

As we scale these solutions across Dow’s portfolio, we anticipate significant benefits,” said Debra Bauler, chief information and digital officer at Dow in a June 2025 press release. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with C3 AI as we advance a world-class predictive maintenance program and uncover further opportunities to enhance efficiency, reliability, and productivity throughout our operations.” [...] The thousands of employees losing their jobs are being cut as part of a rhyming companywide initiative called “Transform to Outperform” that aims to radically simplify operations, and modernize its go-to-market playbook in the hopes of achieving $2 billion in EBITDA improvement by 2028.\n\n\&quot;The goal of Transform to Outperform is to achieve significant growth and productivity gains that elevate Dow&#x27;s competitive position,\&quot; said Karen S.

Sadly, it&#x27;s not Gottumukkala&#x27;s – nor the Trump administration&#x27;s – first security slipup.\n\nGottumukkala also reportedly sought access to highly sensitive cyber intelligence over the summer, and then placed six staffers on leave after they administered a counterintelligence polygraph exam that he failed.\n\nEarlier this month, Gottumukkala reportedly tried to oust CISA&#x27;s Chief Information Officer Robert Costello.

Attacks are increasingly autonomous, fast, and machine-driven, rendering traditional defenses, manual playbooks, and human-led workflows insufficient. Security teams are inundated with alerts, operational bottlenecks, and the constant risk of undetected breaches. ASOP.ai addresses this challenge by delivering an autonomous, multi-agent AI platform capable of detecting, analyzing, and mitigating threats in real time at cloud-scale. [...] ASOP.ai&#x27;s architecture leverages a network of intelligent agents that operate collaboratively, each capable of observing system behaviors, identifying anomalies, and executing mitigation strategies autonomously. Agents share context continuously, creating a dynamic, self-learning ecosystem that adapts as threats evolve. This multi-agent orchestration allows ASOP.ai to respond to sophisticated, machine-driven attacks that would outpace conventional human-driven SOC workflows, effectively simulating the decision-making of expert security teams at scale.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Oracle is leading the way in bringing agentic AI to enterprise applications, embedding AI-driven automation across HCM and ERP systems. With a growing number of AI agents already available, Oracle continues to expand its capabilities, releasing new AI-driven innovations as part of their regular quarterly maintenance and patching cycles. This ensures that customers always have access to the latest advancements without disruption to their existing operations.\n\nKey differentiators: [...] If you are an existing Oracle ERP user, the next step is to unlock and activate the power of AI agents. In particular, for Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM), AI can automate key processes such as recruitment, workforce planning, and employee engagement. Additionally, AI features in recruitment can lead to significant improvement in time to hire. AI-driven assistants can analyse workforce trends, predict attrition risks, and recommend personalised career development opportunities, ultimately improving employee satisfaction and retention.\n\nPwC can guide you through this journey, helping you leverage AI to enhance efficiency, automate processes, and gain deeper business insights. [...] For example, in Human Capital Management (HCM), AI-driven workforce planning agents can analyse historical employee data, predict hiring needs, and automate recruitment workflows. These agents can also assist in employee engagement by monitoring sentiment analysis from internal surveys and providing recommendations for improving workplace satisfaction and retention. According to the same PwC survey, more than half (56%) of CEOs interviewed said that GenAI has resulted in efficiencies in how employees use their time.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;## Agentic AI Is the Next Turning Point\n\nThe enterprise software industry is standing at another such turning point. This time, the disruptive force is agentic AI. Workday -- widely viewed as the successor to PeopleSoft -- has made it clear in its recent announcements that ERP systems are no longer confined to being passive \&quot;systems of record.\&quot; According to Workday&#x27;s CTO, the future lies in making them \&quot;systems of action.\&quot; The difference is profound. Instead of bolting AI onto existing workflows, the opportunity lies in weaving agentic AI into the heart of business processes, enabling systems to not only report and recommend but also to take action.\n\nRelated:The great digital buy-in: What retail CIOs hope AI transformation delivers in 2026 [...] (Source: Dresner Advisory Services)\n\n## Parting Thoughts\n\nAgentic AI is not simply the next technology wave -- it is the next great inflection point for enterprise software. Just as client–server, the Internet, and the cloud radically redefined industry leaders, agentic AI will determine which vendors and enterprises can adapt quickly enough to thrive. The lesson is clear: organizations that treat data as a strategic asset, modernize their platforms, and embed intelligence into their workflows will not only move faster but also serve customers better. The rest risk being left behind -- just as the mainframe giants once were.\n\n## About the Author\n\nMyles Suer\n\nCIO Analyst and Tech Journalist [...] (Source: Dresner Advisory Services)\n\nThe above research surfaced six core features that repeatedly emerged as critical to enabling enterprise-scale AI initiatives:\n\n Data integration or virtualization.\n A semantic layer.\n Workflow automation.\n Agent chaining.\n Integration with foundational models.\n Predictive and proactive systems.\n\nRelated:CIO role in unlocking strategic value: How to determine and implement AI use cases&quot;,

Yet most enterprises remain early in their AI maturity journey, with only 1% operating as optimized, AI-fueled organizations. As global investment accelerates and agentic systems move toward representing half of all AI spending by 2029, the gap between early adopters and laggards will widen dramatically. [...] In this exclusive CIO roundtable hosted by IDC in partnership with AWS &amp; Sudo, we unpack the realities of adopting agentic AI in the enterprise stack, the cloud innovation strategies required for scale, and the digital transformation decisions that will determine competitiveness in the AI era. With 34% of MEA organizations planning to run AI on cloud within the next year, and cloud now serving as the foundation for modern transformation, the moment to act is now.\n\n# Agenda\n\n# Enterprise Agentic AI:\n\n One day event\n\n## One day event\n\n6:30 pm\n\n### Registration &amp; Networking\n\n7:00 pm\n\n### IDC Welcome Address\n\nMelih Murat\n\nAssociate Research Director, IT Services &amp; Software (META), IDC\n\n7:05 pm\n\n### AWS | Sudo Welcome Address\n\n7:10 pm [...] As enterprises accelerate digital transformation on the cloud, the shift toward agentic AI demands stronger alignment between data foundations, cloud architectures, and organizational capabilities. IDC predicts that 65% of custom-built agentic AI initiatives will be abandoned by 2028 due to underestimated complexity, highlighting the need for cloud-enabled scalability, operational governance, and the right transformation frameworks. This discussion explores how CIOs can modernize core systems, enhance cloud readiness, and build an AI-driven operating model that supports sustainable, enterprise-wide agentic AI adoption.\n\nMelih Murat\n\nAssociate Research Director, IT Services &amp; Software (META), IDC\n\n8:20 pm\n\n### Summary &amp; Close\n\n8:30 pm\n\n### Dinner &amp; Networking\n\n## Speakers\n\n### Melih Murat&quot;,

Later phases will enable our employees to act on that knowledge and even fully automate business workflows.\n\n### Phases of maturity\n\nAgentic AI agent types: retrieval, action, and automation.\n\nEach of these levels of agentic capability requires different tools to create and depends on different policies to govern. In the simplest terms, this involves three levels of agent, each of which can handle progressively more complex tasks:\n\n### Retrieval agents [...] #### Solidify labeling and data\n\nRevisit your labeling structures and data flows. It will be important to have these structures in place to support this new agentic environment. Start by learning from our experience governing Copilot at Microsoft.\n\n#### Extend your review process\n\nAdapt any review processes you already have in place to agents, including security, privacy, and accessibility. Embed those reviews into your publishing workflow for agents operating above the individual level. Consider adding reviews for Responsible AI.\n\n#### Prevent agent sprawl\n\nEstablish a reasonable enterprise lifecycle for agents that includes attestation. That will keep agents from sprawling or remaining in place after employees have left your organization or simply no longer need a particular agent. [...] Microsoft Digital, the company’s IT team, is rapidly transforming into a Frontier IT Firm—an organization fundamentally restructured for the AI era, where AI-agents are digital colleagues rather than peripheral tools. “Agents are the most significant technological change we’ve seen since the shift to the cloud, and arguably since the advent of the Internet.” Brian Fielder, Read more\n\n### Enterprise AI maturity in five steps: Our guide for IT leaders&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### 4. Skills &gt; Tools\n\nAn Enterprise Skill is a complete, standalone business action—like “process refund” or “onboard employee”—that executes accurately every time. This is where Enterprise MCP fundamentally differs from raw protocol implementation.\n\nEnterprise Skills make AI agents accurate, predictable and trusted by giving them proven business actions instead of forcing them to improvise with raw APIs.\n\nExample: Instead of an agent orchestrating 7+ separate API calls that might fail or vary each time, it simply uses the “process customer refund” skill—which handles validation, payment, notifications, and rollback automatically.\n\n## Skills, Not Tools: The Foundation of Enterprise MCP [...] ## Three Roles, Three Breaking Points\n\nThese gaps manifest differently depending on who’s trying to deploy agents:\n\nThe three agentic AI challenges CIOs, Developers, and SaaS platforms face.The three agentic AI challenges CIOs, Developers, and SaaS platforms face.\nThe three agentic AI challenges CIOs, Developers, and SaaS platforms face.\n\n### CIOs face the innovation-governance trap\n\nThe business demands AI transformation while maintaining security and compliance. Result: IT is perceived as slowing innovation, even as unauthorized shadow AI spreads.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Siliconangle\n\nSiliconangle\n\nUPDATED 09:00 EST / SEPTEMBER 16 2025\n\n AI\n\n### Agentic AI startup Druid AI targets growth after raising $31M and hiring a new CEO\n\nby Mike Wheatley\n\nAgentic artificial intelligence startup Druid AI S.A. says it’s ready to scale up the adoption of its enterprise-grade platform after closing on a $31 million round of funding and hiring an experienced new leader, former Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and General Electric Co. executive Joseph Kim.\n\nToday’s Series C round was led by Cipio Partners and saw participation from TQ Ventures, Karma Ventures and Smedvig. It’s billed as a strategic growth round that aims to advance the company’s mission to empower enterprises with conversational agents that can perform all kinds of work. [...] Druid AI has developed a platform for creating and operating AI agents that can help businesses to reduce the complexity of their day-to-day operations by automating mundane tasks and freeing up their workers to focus on higher-value work. With Druid AI’s platform, enterprises can deploy hundreds of specialized AI agents to automate all kinds of different business tasks, such as data entry, customer service, information technology support, marketing outreach and many more. [...] The accuracy of Druid AI’s agents stems from the Druid Knowledge Base, which connects each one to an organized repository of company-specific data. The knowledge base integrates dozens of information sources, including databases, Excel and Word documents, emails and data from customer relationship management and human resource management systems into one enormous data lake that serves as a single source of truth.\n\n### Setting the stage for growth&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unaccounted-for AI agents are being handed wide access&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In part, this is by design. \&quot;In the agentic AI world, the value proposition is: give us access to more of your corporate data, and we will do more work for you,\&quot; Nudge Security co-founder and CEO Russell Spitler told The Register. \&quot;Agents need to live inside the existing ecosystem of where that data lives, and that means that they need to live within the existing authentication and access infrastructure that SaaS providers already provide to access your data.\&quot;\n\nThis means AI agents using OAuth tokens to access someone&#x27;s Gmail or OneDrive containing corporate files, or repository access tokens to interact with a GitHub repo that holds source code.\n\nWe&#x27;re letting things happen that we would have never let happen with our human employees [...] It&#x27;s important to note: these are not only agentic identities but also human and machine identities. As of last spring, however, machine identities outnumber human identities by a ratio of 82 to one.\n\nWhen Cyata scans corporate environments, \&quot;we are seeing anywhere from one agent per employee to 17 per employee,\&quot; Tal said. While some roles - specifically research and development and engineering - tend to adopt AI agents more quickly than the rest of their companies, \&quot;folks are adopting agents very, very quickly, and it&#x27;s happening all across the organization.\&quot; [...] Organizations have been using identity security controls for decades to ensure only authorized human users access the appropriate resources to do their jobs, enforcing least-privilege principles and adopting zero-trust-style policies to limit data leaks and credential theft.\n\n\&quot;These new agentic identities are absolutely ungoverned,\&quot; Shahar Tal, the CEO of agentic AI cybersecurity outfit Cyata, told The Register. Agentic identities are the accounts, tokens, and credentials assigned to AI agents so they can access corporate apps and data.&quot;,

Ask any greybeard who lived through the VHS/Betamax wars or millennial who landed on HD-DVD over Blu-ray – nobody wants to invest in the losing side. [...] Originally developed by Google, A2A also uses a client-server architecture along with many of the same messaging and transport protocols as MCP. But rather than talking to tools or data stores, A2A is designed explicitly to facilitate the discovery of other agents, and the communication between them.\n\nThe idea here is that agents may work as a team to solve a problem or perform a task. As we&#x27;ve previously discussed, depending on the complexity of the task, it may make more sense to have multiple agents that each perform a smaller piece of it, rather than one monolithic agent trying to do it all.

From accelerating content creation to streamlining workflows, AI offers transformative benefits that empower organizations to work smarter and faster. These capabilities, however, also introduce new dimensions of data risk—as AI adoption grows, so does the urgency for effective data security that keeps pace with AI innovation. In the 2026 Microsoft Data Security Index report, we explored one of the most pressing questions facing today’s organizations: How can we harness the power of AI while safeguarding sensitive data? [...] ## 3. Strengthening data security with generative AI\n\nThe 2026 Data Security Index indicates that 82% of organizations have developed plans to embed generative AI into their data security operations, up from 64% the previous year.From discovering sensitive data and detecting critical risks to investigating and triaging incidents, as well as refining policies, generative AI is being deployed for both proactive and reactive use cases at scale. The report explores how AI is changing the day-to-day operations across security teams, including the emergence of AI-assisted automation and agents. [...] By consolidating solutions for better visibility and governance controls, implementing robust controls processes to protect data in AI-powered workflows, and using generative AI agents and automation to enhance security programs, organizations can build a resilient foundation for their next wave of generative AI-powered productivity and innovation. The result is a future where AI both drives efficiency and acts as a powerful ally in defending against data risk, unlocking growth without compromising protection.\n\nIn this article we will delve into some of the Data Security Index report’s key findings that relate to generative AI and how they are being operationalized at Microsoft. The report itself has a much broader focus and depth of insight.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;За много предприятия оперативните разходи за AI се превърнаха в катализатор за съществени промени. Някои организации вече се сблъскват с месечни разходи за AI изчисления в размер на десетки милиони, особено с навлизането на агентни AI системи в реална производствена среда. В същото време регулаторните изисквания за местонахождение на данните, нуждата от изключително ниска латентност при приложения в реално време като производство или автономни системи, както и изискванията за устойчивост на критично важни приложения, променят начина, по който се вземат инфраструктурни решения. [...] Hybrid computing becomes a strategic imperative\n\nFor many enterprises, the operational expense of AI has become a catalyst for significant change. Some organizations are already facing monthly AI compute costs in the tens of millions, especially as agentic AI systems move into production. At the same time, regulatory expectations around data residency, the need for ultra-low latency in real-time use cases such as manufacturing or autonomous systems and resilience requirements for mission-critical applications are reshaping infrastructure decisions. [...] Организациите, които предприемат действия още сега за модернизиране на инфраструктурата и за развитие на уменията на своята работна сила, са в по‑добра позиция да оформят следващия етап от корпоративните изчислителни технологии. Напредъкът в специализираните чипове, високоскоростните мрежи и интелигентното управление на работните натоварвания се превръща в основа за мащабното прилагане на AI.\n\nХибридните изчисления се превръщат в стратегически императив&quot;,

Performance metrics must evolve to reward collaboration (including with AI agents), innovation, and impact—not just volume. [...] Enterprise AI Integration Corporate Controller &amp; CAO Hot Topics Many organizations struggle to see a strong return on investment from AI beyond simple tasks. While personal efficiency gains from AI are easily achieved, the real challenge lies in deploying scalable, enterprise solutions. A critical step is the transition from processing unstructured data (e.g., leases, contracts) to creating structured data that can be integrated with other systems. This unlocks sophisticated analysis, such as more accurate accruals and comprehensive risk identification. [...] The widespread deployment of AI is as much a human challenge as it is a technological one. Successfully navigating this transition requires a deep understanding of the cultural and behavioral dynamics at play, forcing organizations to critically reassess talent management, including performance development, training, and cultural norms.\nOvercoming resistance Internal resistance to AI is often rooted in skepticism, fear, or \&quot;AI denial,\&quot; with employees recalling past technology implementations that under-delivered. To address this, organizations are adopting new strategies: • Building workforce readiness: Instead of forcing new skills on overwhelmed employees, some organizations are hiring behavioral scientists to understand and address resistance.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How is generative AI impacting our economy, society and ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Education is another sector where generative AI could prove particularly useful, helping teachers customise learning materials and experiences for their students. However, developing adequate policies and competences is essential to support the integration of generative AI in the education system.\n\nNew business models prompted by generative AI are emerging in the manufacturing sector. For example, the new generative AI model, the agentic AI, allows the autonomous management of production tasks, automating processes, optimising supply chain or reducing waste, overall leading to improved efficiency.\n\nThe shifts in the labour market and AI-related skills [...] The shifts in the labour market and AI-related skills\n\nGenerative AI is shifting labour market dynamics. Doctors, teachers, engineers and other high-skill professions are being impacted more by generative AI than previous technological innovations. For example, a JRC study found that teachers were more exposed to AI than 90% of other occupations.\n\nGenerative AI is also causing a shift in the demand of skills, highlighting an increased need for transversal skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and digital skills related to the development and maintenance of AI systems.\n\nImpacts on social groups and inequalities [...] How generative AI supports different economic sectors\n\nGenerative AI could bring considerable productivity gains, especially in high-skill professions. The report analyses how generative AI is impacting specific sectors.\n\nFor example healthcare, where generative AI could help face the pressure of an aging population and workforce shortages. Generative AI can be used for personalised medicine, the prevention and early diagnosis of diseases, or the creation of coherent overviews from fragmented medical information. The high potential of generative AI in healthcare is reflected in the large share of activity in the EU, which accounts for almost 10% of the total generative AI research, innovation, and business activities.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team. [...] AI is transforming marketing into a proactive driver of growth. With AI agents handling tasks across content, campaigns, planning, and analytics, marketers can focus on creativity, strategy, and customer connection. In this new model, humans can bring empathy and brand insight while AI delivers precision and scale. Together, they can create faster, more personalized, and more effective experiences with insights and optimization opportunities identified proactively rather than reactively. Here’s what CMOs should know:\n\n### AI-enabled HR: Building a more capable and nimbler workforce [...] New skills and focus can remake the function. HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin&quot;,

Today:\n\nWe learned this the hard way: AI is not magic. Agents and systems do not automatically create impact. Re-architecting work does.\n\n# Platform + process + people = impact\n\nFor leaders working to build an AI-powered enterprise, we’ve found that having a method matters.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Deciphering the alphabet soup of agentic AI protocols&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Originally developed by Google, A2A also uses a client-server architecture along with many of the same messaging and transport protocols as MCP. But rather than talking to tools or data stores, A2A is designed explicitly to facilitate the discovery of other agents, and the communication between them.\n\nThe idea here is that agents may work as a team to solve a problem or perform a task. As we&#x27;ve previously discussed, depending on the complexity of the task, it may make more sense to have multiple agents that each perform a smaller piece of it, rather than one monolithic agent trying to do it all. [...] Alongside A2A, Google is working on an Agent to UI protocol, called A2UI. The idea behind the open source protocol is that rather than text-only responses, agents should be able to generate interfaces dynamically on request. For example, if you want help booking a flight, instead of a chat interface, the agent would generate a point and click interface to walk you through the booking.\n\nIt works a bit like this: a request is sent to an agent, which generates messages describing what the UI should look like and sends them back to the client, where they&#x27;re rendered using established frameworks like Flutter or React. When the user interacts with the interface, new UI elements are generated in response. [...] Early attempts to give agents a credit card to make purchases haven&#x27;t always worked out perfectly. In at least one scenario, OpenAI&#x27;s shopping agent decided that spending $31 on a dozen eggs was a totally reasonable expense.\n\nAnd, as nice as it might be to have an agent that restocks your sundries when you&#x27;re actually running low instead of on a set schedule, nobody is going to be happy when the agent decides ordering a lifetime supply of single ply toilet paper is a good idea. AP2 aims to prevent these kinds of missteps.\n\n### Everything else\n\nAlongside a growing number of agentic protocols competing for industry adoption are all the other frameworks and tools used to actually build and deploy the agents on which they&#x27;re based.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“When we successfully rolled out AI in talent acquisition, we could see a year ahead that we were going to eliminate jobs, which of course would impact our people’s lives. So, we were incredibly transparent with our team. ... Did they want to be trained to do the next-level work, or did they want us to help them identify other roles in the organization that better fit their skills? Regardless, the goal was to be proactive with these changes while supporting and empowering employees to contribute to something meaningful.”\n\nChris Courneen, Senior Vice President of HR at MSI [...] The HR function introduced an AI assistant platform, named Mira, to handle repetitive recruitment and administrative tasks. This technology reduced the time spent on these activities by 20% and cut HR’s administrative involvement in these processes by 40%. More importantly, Mira eliminated all of the rote onboarding tasks that typically fell on the local management teams’ plates, freeing them up to focus on training and onboarding new hires instead of completing paperwork and compliance tasks. This also allowed the HR and recruitment teams to focus on more strategic priorities, including identifying opportunities to implement this technology in other areas of the business, which significantly reduced the length of the hiring process, as outlined in one example in Figure 5 for a driver [...] The effects of these efforts were striking: Within three years, these efforts reduced the organization’s cost-per-hire by 66%, resulting in more than $6.5 million in savings. The retention improvement during this period also resulted in another $4 million in savings for the organization and reinforced the value of investing in improving talent acquisition strategies and focusing on employee retention.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Unaccounted-for AI agents are being handed wide access&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;This is causing an identity crisis of sorts, and neither Tal nor the other AI security folks The Register spoke to for this story believe that agentic identities should be included in the larger machine identities counts. AI agents are dynamic and context-aware - in other words, they act more like humans than machines.\n\n\&quot;AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts,\&quot; Teleport CEO Ev Kontsevoy told us.\n\n\&quot;An agent functions around the clock and acts in unpredictable ways. For example, they may execute the same task with different approaches, continuously creating new access paths,\&quot; he added. \&quot;This requires accessing critical resources like MCP servers, APIs, databases, internal services, LLMs, and orchestration systems.\&quot; [...] It&#x27;s important to note: these are not only agentic identities but also human and machine identities. As of last spring, however, machine identities outnumber human identities by a ratio of 82 to one.\n\nWhen Cyata scans corporate environments, \&quot;we are seeing anywhere from one agent per employee to 17 per employee,\&quot; Tal said. While some roles - specifically research and development and engineering - tend to adopt AI agents more quickly than the rest of their companies, \&quot;folks are adopting agents very, very quickly, and it&#x27;s happening all across the organization.\&quot; [...] \&quot;We&#x27;re letting things happen right now that we would have never let happen with our human employees,\&quot; he said. \&quot;We&#x27;re letting thousands of interns run around in our production environment, and then we give them the keys to the kingdom. One of the key pain points that I hear from every company is that they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening\&quot; with their AI agents.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Opening digital markets so AI can shop — and negotiate&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For the agents to do their jobs, the researchers say there would need to be standardized frameworks and protocols so the agents can both discover each other and conduct secure interactions.\n\nWhile consumers would adopt and train their personal AI assistant agents, researchers say, several groups must be involved in building and governing the open agentic economy: technology companies, standards bodies, businesses/service providers, governments and regulatory bodies. The researchers contend this would help ensure the new marketplaces stay open, competitive and secure. [...] “Otherwise, momentum and ease are going to push us into that version of walled gardens,” he says. “And that would mean less overall welfare and opportunity for society.”\n\n## Why have an open agentic economy?\n\nIn the paper, Microsoft researchers say that letting many different AI agents operate in an open market is the best path forward. In this setup, the agents help markets run more smoothly, make it easier for people to switch between services, and give more people access to digital tools and services in a decentralized way.\n\nCo-author and Program Manager Matt Vogel says he believes an open agentic economy will be beneficial for both people and companies. [...] ## How to get to an open agentic economy\n\nThe researchers say that to form an open agentic economy, several key technological and structural developments will be required. First, the widespread adoption of assistant and service agents and programmatic inter-agent communication. Once people and businesses adopt to using AI agents as their representatives, those agents must be able to communicate, unscripted, with each other.\n\nThis would be done in a neutral digital marketplace, akin to how the International Space Station was created in cooperation with businesses and governments, rather than on any one platform owned by a single company.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is an agent?\n\nAgents are specialized AI-powered assistants that automate and execute business processes, working alongside or on behalf of a person, team, or organization. They range from simple prompt-and-response agents to more advanced, fully autonomous agents. Through specific instructions, grounding, connectors, APIs, and custom orchestration, creators can tailor agents to more focused workflows than a comprehensive AI solution like Microsoft 365 Copilot. [...] Our goal has been to provide access and enable their use at appropriate levels for our employees and the company as a whole. To make that happen, we’ve adopted a maturity model for agentic AI deployment. Early phases focus on using Copilot, grounded in enterprise data, to enhance knowledge discovery and retrieval. Later phases will enable our employees to act on that knowledge and even fully automate business workflows.\n\n### Phases of maturity\n\nAgentic AI agent types: retrieval, action, and automation.\n\nEach of these levels of agentic capability requires different tools to create and depends on different policies to govern. In the simplest terms, this involves three levels of agent, each of which can handle progressively more complex tasks:\n\n### Retrieval agents [...] Microsoft Digital, the company’s IT team, is rapidly transforming into a Frontier IT Firm—an organization fundamentally restructured for the AI era, where AI-agents are digital colleagues rather than peripheral tools. “Agents are the most significant technological change we’ve seen since the shift to the cloud, and arguably since the advent of the Internet.” Brian Fielder, Read more\n\n### Enterprise AI maturity in five steps: Our guide for IT leaders&quot;,

According to Jakob, many organiza-tions recognize the transformative potential but struggle with its implementation due to legacy systems and data architecture. “At KPMG, we help clients transform their business in four areas: process, people, tech-nology, and data. It takes a more holistic view on the project to manage all four areas, which is where we can make the biggest difference. We are helping them navigate the shift to become AI-driven, advising on everything from transforming call centers to implementing the “Frontier Firm” model - teams where AI agents work alongside human employees, with humans handling exceptions while AI manages routine work.” No matter if we work on enabling AI for our clients or assist them in other areas, “our top priority [...] The introduction of the AI-enabled Degreed platform has further strengthened our learning founda-tion.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI inference is reshaping enterprise compute strategies&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;За много предприятия оперативните разходи за AI се превърнаха в катализатор за съществени промени. Някои организации вече се сблъскват с месечни разходи за AI изчисления в размер на десетки милиони, особено с навлизането на агентни AI системи в реална производствена среда. В същото време регулаторните изисквания за местонахождение на данните, нуждата от изключително ниска латентност при приложения в реално време като производство или автономни системи, както и изискванията за устойчивост на критично важни приложения, променят начина, по който се вземат инфраструктурни решения. [...] Hybrid computing becomes a strategic imperative\n\nFor many enterprises, the operational expense of AI has become a catalyst for significant change. Some organizations are already facing monthly AI compute costs in the tens of millions, especially as agentic AI systems move into production. At the same time, regulatory expectations around data residency, the need for ultra-low latency in real-time use cases such as manufacturing or autonomous systems and resilience requirements for mission-critical applications are reshaping infrastructure decisions. [...] Трансформацията на инфраструктурата, необходима за мащабно внедряване на AI, изисква и значително преквалифициране на работната сила. IT екипите трябва да преминат от управление на традиционни сървъри към експлоатация на GPU клъстери, високоскоростни мрежи и усъвършенствани системи за охлаждане. Мрежовите архитекти трябва да проектират инфраструктура, съобразена със специфичните модели на трафик при AI натоварвания, докато инженерите трябва да развият знания в оптимизирането на хибридни изчислителни портфейли и в икономическите аспекти на използването на AI.&quot;,

It carries huge potential in terms of scale and efficiency, but there are operational challenges too, getting people comfortable with it, bringing boards on the journey. People have to be encouraged and trained responsibly, with policies and guardrails. But the potential is extraordinary.”\n\n“AI has the power to enhance human judgment rather than replace it,” Geraghty agrees. “Firms that succeed are those that pair technological fluency with emotional intelligence as this is essential to the next generation of leadership.” [...] deloitte_logo\ndeloitte_logo\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Together makes progress\n\n### Our history\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Generative AI services\n\n### Operate services\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog\n\n### Deloitte AI Institute Luxembourg\n\n### Future of Advice Blog [...] “Enda is absolutely right,” Prendergast agrees. “It’s that confluence of technology, regulation, user experience, and institutional integration that we must bring together.

It can appear in many different user experiences. Here are some examples: [...] Sidecar: Copilot sits alongside the application as a sidecar and provides conversational support to the user. The sidecar is the primary Copilot interface in finance and operations apps. It provides a natural language chat experience that helps users work with application functionality and data. For example, the generative help and guidance with Copilot feature is provided as a sidecar.\n Embedded: These Copilot features add intelligent capabilities to the application itself. In this way, they bring AI to the center of the application experience. For example, in the Confirmed purchase orders with changes workspace, AI capabilities that are built into the page help users understand and react to changes in confirmed purchase orders.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Our research finds that the functional areas where AI presents the greatest economic potential are also those where employee outlook is lukewarm. Employees in sales and marketing, software engineering, customer service, and R&amp;D contribute roughly three-quarters of AI’s total economic potential, but the self-reported optimism of employees in these functions is middling (Exhibit 14). It may be the case that these functions have piloted AI projects, leading employees to be more realistic about AI’s benefits and limitations. Or perhaps the economic potential has made them worry that AI could replace their jobs. Whatever the reasons, leaders in these functions might consider investing more in employee support and elevating the change champions who can improve that sentiment.\n\nExhibit 14 [...] In many transformations, employees are not ready for change, but AI is different. Employee readiness and familiarity are high, which gives business leaders the permission space to act. Leaders can listen to employees describe how they are using AI today and how they envision their work being transformed. They also can provide employees with much-needed training and empower managers to move AI use cases from pilot to scale.\n\nIt’s critical that leaders meet this moment. It’s the only way to accelerate the probability that their companies will reach AI maturity. But they must move with alacrity, or they will fall behind.\n\nChapter 3\n\nDelivering speed and safety.\n\nExhibit 6 [...] Chapter 2\n\nEmployees are ready for AI; now leaders must step up and C-suite leaders (99 percent) report having some level of familiarity with gen AI tools. Nevertheless, business leaders underestimate how extensively their employees are using gen AI. C-suite leaders estimate that only 4 percent of employees use gen AI for at least 30 percent of their daily work, when in fact that percentage is three times greater, as self-reported by employees (Exhibit 2). And while only a total of 20 percent of leaders believe employees will use gen AI for more than 30 percent of their daily tasks within a year, employees are twice as likely (47 percent) to believe they will (see sidebar “Who is using AI at work? Nearly everyone, even skeptical employees”).&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The AI productivity trap: Why your best engineers are getting ...&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;AI tools, in their current chat-based forms, encourage a fragmented workflow. You stop coding, you prompt the bot, you wait, you review, you reject, you re-prompt. The flow is gone.\n\nWorse, as you try to fix the AI’s errors by feeding it more code snippets, you encounter context rot. The model gets distracted by irrelevant details and starts producing bloated, off-target code. The senior engineer ends up acting as a glorified editor for a very fast, very confident intern who doesn’t understand the history of the company.\n\n## Changing the game plan\n\nSo, if the current copilot model is a trap for your best talent, what do we do? We certainly don’t ban AI. That would be like banning calculators because you sometimes hit the wrong button. [...] But as someone who spends his days building mission-critical financial infrastructure and autonomous agent platforms, I have to be the bearer of bad news: it’s not working out that way. At least, not for your best engineers.\n\nThe deployment of AI copilots into the workflows of experienced engineers isn’t producing the frictionless acceleration promised in the brochures. Instead, I’m seeing the emergence of a productivity trap — a hidden tax on velocity that is disproportionately hitting your most valuable technical talent.\n\nI’m not saying this because I’m skeptical of the tech. I am an AI optimist and I build AI systems for a living. But we need to be honest about the data. For complex, high-stakes engineering tasks, AI tools are currently making experienced developers slower. [...] The results were stark. When experienced developers used AI tools to complete real-world maintenance tasks, they took 19% longer than when they worked without them.\n\nHow can a tool that generates code instantly result in a net loss of time?\n\nIt comes down to what I call the illusion of velocity. In the study, developers felt faster. They predicted the AI would save them huge amounts of time. Even after they finished — and were objectively recorded as being slower — they still believed the AI had been a timesaver.\n\nThe AI gives you a dopamine hit. Text appears on the screen at superhuman speed and the blank page problem vanishes. But the engineer’s role has shifted from being a creator to being a reviewer and that is where the trap snaps shut.\n\n## The almost-right valley of death&quot;,

[...] # What is financial reporting automation?\n\nPeople sitting at a desk with superimposed graphs over them\n\n## Financial reporting automation, defined\n\nFinancial reporting automation is the process of financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A) by using artificial intelligence (AI) and automation-powered software to streamline financial reporting processes.\n\nWith automated financial reporting, FP&amp;A teams can automate tedious reporting tasks and prepare financial statements and reports in real-time. They can also automate workflows, create automatic audit trails and manage consolidation and verification. This process frees up team members to focus on more strategic initiatives like analysis and relationship building. [...] Staff Writer\n\nIBM Think\n\nStaff Editor\n\nIBM Think\n\n69% of CFOs say that AI is central to finance transformation. This guide shows you how to unlock these benefits and stay ahead in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. From FP&amp;A to procure-to-pay, AI is streamlining workflows, predicting anomalies and enabling smarter decisions.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;“AI is influencing how organizations think about talent, but the real opportunity is in how it is applied,” Dimitri Boylan, founder and CEO of Avature, said in a statement. “The next phase depends on HR’s ability to use AI to understand skills, anticipate change and make better workforce decisions.”\n\nNotably, while workers report using AI tools, many remain in the dark about how their employers plan to implement AI, a Gallup report from December said.\n\nPost to LinkedIn\nShare on Facebook\nPost to X\nPrint this page\nEmail this page\nLicense this article\n\n### HR Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\nDaily Dive newsletter example\n\n### Editors&#x27; picks [...] ### Dive Brief:\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nAs AI tool adoption increases, the trust gap remains a sticking point for HR in particular, various reports have indicated.\n\nFor example, close to 3 in 4 workers surveyed said being interviewed by an AI agent would change their perception of the company — and not always for the better, according to a November 2025 report from SHL.\n\nInternal usage can also backfire.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Бързото развитие на генеративния изкуствен интелект ускори бизнес иновациите във всички индустрии, но същевременно разкри и сериозно предизвикателство пред инфраструктурата. Макар че много организации първоначално разчитаха на облачни услуги, за да експериментират с AI, непрекъснатият и интензивен характер на използването на AI модели оказва безпрецедентен натиск върху съществуващите изчислителни стратегии. Честите API заявки, нарастващата интензивност на използване и постоянно работещите AI приложения водят до значително и често непредвидимо увеличение на разходите. [...] Inference economics expose infrastructure gaps\n\nThe rapid evolution of generative AI has accelerated business innovation across industries, but it has also exposed a critical infrastructure challenge. While many organizations initially relied on cloud-based services to experiment with AI, the continuous and high-volume nature of AI inference is placing unprecedented strain on existing computing strategies. Frequent API calls, rising usage intensity and always-on AI applications are driving significant and often unpredictable cost escalation.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Forrester Logo\n\n# It’s People All The Way Down\n\nTed Schadler, VP, Principal Analyst\n\nNope, not turtles. Not AI surfaces. Not AI agents. Not multiagent autonomous orchestration gobbledygook. Just people. Without a person at the end of the chain, it’s just machinery. (That is, unless the machinery breaks things in the real world and flights are grounded, bank transactions disappear, or cars start driving into each other.) [...] That there is always a person on the other side of the interaction is a point of view, my framing of reality. There are plenty of wizards and pundits and founders and super smart investor types who believe otherwise. They imagine a world where machines talk to machines and people just sit back and enjoy the ride. (Though how they think people will see purpose in their no-work, no-hassle, no-feeling-of-accomplishment lives escapes me.)\n\nHow does a belief that it’s people all the way down help you make sense of the AI world and make good decisions about what to do as a business or technology leader? At least these things:\n\nArmed with a different point of view — that people matter more than automation — you are poised to tame AI and apply it to your business.\n\n###### Categories [...] ###### Categories\n\n### Get The Insights At Work Newsletter\n\n### Thanks for signing up.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.\n\n### AI, Buying Networks, Revenue Growth — Master It All\n\n#### Forrester’s B2B Summits connect you with analysts and insights to help you navigate buying shifts, win with AI, accelerate growth, and transform revenue.\n\n## New Research: Untangle Healthcare’s Revenue Cycle Mess\n\n## Why Digital Commerce Is Your Fast Track To Global Market Entry\n\n## Get The Insights At Work Newsletter\n\n### Thanks for signing up.\n\nStay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.\n\n##### Who We Are\n\n##### What We Offer\n\n##### About\n\nForrester Logo\nForrester Logo&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;New skills and focus can remake the function. HR’s own mix of roles, skills, recruitment, and incentives should evolve too: Skills in people management and policy still matter, but so do new skills in interpreting data, designing experiences, operating across multiple HR domains, and working hand-in-hand with the business.\n\nMore capacity to connect talent to business outcomes. With a new, AI-enabled HR operating model, you can reduce human effort by 40% to 50% across HR. That can free your team to focus on workforce, incentive, succession planning, location strategies, operating model implications, strategies for high-potential employees, and other ways to connect talent to business outcomes.\n\n## Six ways to begin [...] AI gives HR the opportunity to move beyond process management and become a strategic driver of workforce performance. With the right design, HR can shape how work gets done, how capabilities grow, and how the organization adapts to change. Here’s what CHROs should know:\n\nThe HR business leader can become a business strategist. As new HR generalist roles—like HR operations leads and talent strategists—direct AI agents to handle routine tasks, HRBPs can focus on business outcomes. They can, for example, create bespoke, x-capability focused pods and upskill these pods not by position, but as a team. [...] ## Six ways to begin\n\nThe organizations that are successful with AI typically aren’t starting at the edges. They’re starting at the top. Leadership identifies a few high-impact areas for investment, sets a clear strategy, and guides a focused path to value. That can include building a user-friendly orchestration layer to help create and manage workflows and focusing on Responsible AI to enhance performance and grow stakeholder trust.\n\nBut strategy alone likely won&#x27;t deliver outcomes. Here’s how you can get started.\n\n### Enter the future of work with AI\n\nA new era of agentic work is revolutionizing business\n\nLearn more\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nShebani Patel\n\nWorkforce Solutions Practice Leader, PwC US\n\nEmail\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nBrad Herndon\n\nPrincipal, Sales, Service and Marketing, PwC US\n\nEmail&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Building an AI-powered company - CIO&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# We view AI as an operating-model decision\n\nWe mapped AI across every corporate function, including talent, engineering, marketing, finance, HR, IT, and operations, to identify where agents and intelligent systems could materially improve productivity and outcomes.\n\nThis required two parallel efforts:\n\nIt worked.\n\nWe pushed hard to become a “learn-it-all” company around AI. Today:\n\nWe learned this the hard way: AI is not magic. Agents and systems do not automatically create impact. Re-architecting work does.\n\n# Platform + process + people = impact\n\nFor leaders working to build an AI-powered enterprise, we’ve found that having a method matters. It keeps us from depending on a handful of heroes, or a lot of luck.\n\nOurs is built on three elements: [...] # We keep closing the adoption gap\n\nOn the personal side, people are using AI constantly. We’re experimenting. We’re connecting tools. We’re improving how we work.\n\nThen too many of us walk (or Zoom) into work and end up either creating AI workslop, getting stuck with legacy systems, or inadvertently violating policies from HR, IT, finance, legal, or a random someone who simply says, “No.”\n\nThat’s why I treat AI as a leadership issue, not just an IT issue. If we, as leaders, don’t actively close that gap, the transformation required to scale AI won’t happen at the speed the market demands.\n\n# We view AI as an operating-model decision [...] For anyone making decisions in a company today, we have a responsibility to help ourselves and our teams face what’s real: AI is changing the economics of work, and the people and companies that don’t adapt will be left behind.\n\n# 2025 was our pivot year\n\nFrom my seat, 2025 is when the “green shoots” of agentic AI started showing up in a real way. If 2024 was the year of experimentation (AI for fun, a cool new toy), then 2025 was the year of proving that AI works at work.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the debate is over, or that we’ve solved every problem or answered every question. But the direction is clear: enterprises are moving from copilots toward agent-enhanced workflows.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] ### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024.&quot;,

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Agentic AI workforce redesign&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;There’s another likely benefit to early-career workers: When they’re equipped with AI agents, they can meaningfully contribute faster than before. At PwC, for example, our audit teams use AI to help execute many specialized audit tasks and deliver a more seamless client experience. So, instead of focusing our entry-level auditors on narrow technical tasks, we also teach them to use AI agents—and to think critically, support our longstanding focus on independence, audit quality, and data security, and focus on clients’ big-picture needs.\n\n## Diamond or hourglass? Avoid the easy mistake and build the organization you need [...] If your company is based on knowledge work, reducing early-career workers could limit apprenticeship and starve your organization of its future: You won&#x27;t be developing the high-performing generalists and business leaders (with experience in your unique processes) who could fill your upper ranks and be your differential. For these knowledge-intensive firms, an hourglass structure—which we’re building in-house at PwC—can be a better choice. Here, entry-level roles can expand as AI-literate, business-savvy, and change-ready employees ramp up quickly, so they can contribute at a high level across workflows. Experienced specialists can expand their reach, combining their creativity, experience, and strategic insight with the scale and speed of AI agents. [...] ## Six ways to begin\n\nThe organizations that are successful with AI typically aren’t starting at the edges. They’re starting at the top. Leadership identifies a few high-impact areas for investment, sets a clear strategy, and guides a focused path to value. That can include building a user-friendly orchestration layer to help create and manage workflows and focusing on Responsible AI to enhance performance and grow stakeholder trust.\n\nBut strategy alone likely won&#x27;t deliver outcomes. Here’s how you can get started.\n\n### Enter the future of work with AI\n\nA new era of agentic work is revolutionizing business\n\nLearn more\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nShebani Patel\n\nWorkforce Solutions Practice Leader, PwC US\n\nEmail\n\nLinkedIn icon\n\nBrad Herndon\n\nPrincipal, Sales, Service and Marketing, PwC US\n\nEmail&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024. [...] window, code execution capabilities, and Gemma 2 are available today,” blog entry by Logan Kilpatrick, Shrestha Basu Mallick, and Ronen Kofman, June 27, 2024. Overall, we see five big innovations for business that are driving the next wave of impact: enhanced intelligence and reasoning capabilities, agentic AI, multimodality, improved hardware innovation and computational power, and increased transparency.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;As the GenAI wave progresses into agentic AI, with AI agents becoming commonplace in areas from financial control to HR to customer service, the benefits are set to multiply. So private businesses need to ensure their people are using AI effectively, by finding a way to invest in it without breaking the bank. This means taking a phased implementation approach, starting with those use cases that offer the fastest payback, and applying measurement tools to get a clear view of the resulting impacts and returns.\n\n3.

Non-human identity compromise (API keys, service accounts, OAuth tokens) is now a top initial attack vector.\n\nIt&#x27;s already hitting AI systems. A supply chain attack on the OpenAI plugin ecosystem harvested agent credentials from 47 enterprise deployments; attackers had access for six months before anyone noticed.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In short,OpenClaw has all the ingredients for this week’s featured AI recipe: a tool that actually works, personal stakes and just enough absurdity to fuel memes. That combination has resonated deeply with the GTD—or “get things done”— lifehacking community, said IBM Senior Research Scientist Marina Danilevsky on the latest episode of_Mixture of Experts_. “It is very personal, it’s very easy,and you can get both very practical and very silly with it.” [...] My IBM Log in Subscribe\n\nArtificial IntelligenceEmerging technology\n\nOpenClaw: The viral “space lobster” agent testing the limits of vertical integration\n\n Published 29 January 2026 \n\n Updated 30 January 2026 \n\nImage 1: Cheese Factory \n\n By Aili McConnon [...] Demos of the agent autonomously completing tasks rocketed across X, TikTok and Reddit,and the tool has racked up over100,000 GitHub stars to date.Users acrosssocial mediahave called out its persistent memory and the fact that its agentic behavior makes it feel less like a chatbot and more like a true digital employee or assistant. If that weren’t enough, its mascot is an adorable “space lobster,” inspired by Molty,Steinberger’s personal AI assistant.\n\nWhere vertical integration may not be needed&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Share TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas: Enabling Transformation and Efficiency. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas: Enabling Transformation and Efficiency. TCS’ agentic AI platform helps manufacturing firms scale, govern, and optimize intelligent agents, creating a unified operational backbone for transformation. * Scale agentic AI across diverse platforms with a unified backbone for governance, orchestration, and enterprise knowledge. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas unifies and scales AI agents across enterprise systems—embedding governance, observability, and resilience to accelerate transformation. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas is an agentic AI platform designed to help organizations move beyond isolated AI pilots and scale agent-driven operations across the enterprise. Unlike traditional platforms that focus primarily on agent development, Manufacturing AI Canvas emphasizes how agents operate in production. For manufacturing enterprises, these super agents provide a head start by encapsulating proven patterns for supply chain orchestration, procurement optimization, maintenance planning, and operational decision-making—helping organizations transition quickly from experimentation to production-scale use cases. In manufacturing and industrial settings—where reliability is paramount and processes span multiple systems—the absence of a unified platform increases risk, slows adoption, and fuels skepticism about the scalability of agentic AI. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas provides a unified operational backbone for agentic AI, enabling enterprises to scale, govern, and optimize intelligent agents across diverse platforms and critical business systems. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas enables enterprises to manage agentic AI at scale through a centralized execution and operations layer. Teams retain the flexibility to use their preferred development platforms, while all agent actions are coordinated through a unified system that standardizes workflows, maintains shared enterprise knowledge, and enforces consistent controls. For manufacturing organizations, pre-built Super Agents accelerate adoption by delivering proven solutions for supply chain orchestration, procurement optimization, maintenance planning, and operational decision-making. Manufacturing AI Canvas enforces enterprise policy and operational discipline at the point where agents interact with real systems and data, ensuring consistent controls regardless of the underlying platform—whether Foundry, Copilot, ServiceNow, Agentforce, UiPath, Camunda, or custom runtimes. TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas provides enterprises with a streamlined approach to scaling agentic AI responsibly. **TCS Manufacturing AI Canvas** enables outcomes-focused automation across supply chain, procurement, maintenance, and operations—backed by the discipline required for mission-critical enterprise environments.

      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;AI in the workplace: A report for 2025 | McKinsey&quot;,
      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] ### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024.&quot;,

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Conclusion\n\nMeeting the AI future, and adoption reflects how extensively these products are used to generate measurable business value. Given the emerging nature of AI, many companies are simultaneously deploying and adopting, iterating as they go. Therefore, this report often uses adoption and deployment interchangeably to refer to the overall uptake of AI tools.\n\nAgentic AI: Systems with autonomy and goal-directed behavior capable of making independent decisions, planning, and adapting to achieve specific objectives without direct, ongoing human input. [...] ### Agentic AI is acting autonomously\n\n&gt; I’ve always thought of AI as the most profound technology humanity is working on . . . more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet [...] Software companies are embedding agentic AI capabilities into their core products. For example, Salesforce’s Agentforce is a new layer on its existing platform that enables users to easily build and deploy autonomous AI agents to handle complex tasks across workflows, such as simulating product launches and orchestrating marketing campaigns.8 Sammy Spiegel, “The future of AI agents: Top predictions and trends to watch in 2025,” Salesforce, December 2024. Marc Benioff, Salesforce cofounder, chair, and CEO, describes this as providing a “digital workforce” where humans and automated agents work together to achieve customer outcomes.9 Marc Benioff, “How the rise of new digital workers will lead to an unlimited age,” _Time_, November 25, 2024.&quot;,
