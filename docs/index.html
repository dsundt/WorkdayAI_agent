<li><b>Workday Finalizes Acquisition of Sana (Nov 4, 2025).</b> <a href="https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-04-Workday-Completes-Acquisition-of-Sana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full details.</a><br />
<p>Workday has completed its acquisition of Sana, an AI-native workplace app platform. The technology empowers Workday to embed generative and agentic AI within its HCM and Finance applications, Workday Extend, and the Workday AI Marketplace. For Deloitte’s Workday teams, this expands opportunities for rapid deployment of custom AI-powered solutions and automations across client environments. This announcement signals Workday’s determination to keep pace with key rivals building AI-powered agent platforms for enterprise customers.</p></li>

<li><b>SAP and Snowflake Announce AI Data Interoperability and Agentic AI Capabilities (Nov 4, 2025).</b> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/sap-snowflake-partnership-ai-data-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the announcement.</a><br />
<p>SAP and Snowflake have launched a strategic partnership that introduces fully governed, zero-copy interoperability of SAP data within Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud, including Cortex AISQL operator GA and the launch of Snowflake Intelligence for explainable, agentic AI. This breakthrough tackles historic roadblocks around HR and finance data portability and agentic automation, challenging Workday and partners to deliver equally open and compliant AI ecosystems.</p></li>

<li><b>AI-Driven Governance Platform Portal26 Raises $9M (Nov 4, 2025).</b> <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/portal26-nabs-9m-ai-application-governance-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the coverage.</a><br />
<p>The $9M funding round for Portal26 spotlights growing AI governance needs for enterprise SaaS, especially HR and finance platforms. With AI agents permeating critical workflows, clients and regulators expect transparency and compliance-by-design, positioning Deloitte to lead on responsible AI readiness and vendor integration for Workday deployments.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>SAP:</b> <p>Debuted AI data interoperability with Snowflake, launched business-grounded agentic AI creation tools, and emphasized rapid, compliant AI extensibility. SAP’s accelerated ecosystem push pressures Workday and partners to match in open AI, customization, and cross-platform governance.</p></li>
<li><b>UKG:</b> <p>Rolled out UKG Beacon, offering advanced AI analytics and agent-led labor management for SMBs. Raises standards for agentic SaaS in HR and workforce management, urging Workday to continuously raise its AI-native, SMB-targeted capabilities.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Enablement</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Designing and Deploying Agentic AI in SaaS Workflows</b><br /><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/build-business-grounded-ai-agents-faster/ba/p/14258166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Blog: Build Business-Grounded AI Agents, Faster</a><br />Objective: Enable delivery teams to rapidly develop and adapt agentic solutions across client SaaS environments.</li>
<li><b>Responsible AI Governance for Enterprise Platforms</b><br /><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/portal26-nabs-9m-ai-application-governance-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal26 funding news</a><br />Objective: Integrate robust governance and compliance into every stage of Workday AI adoption.</li>
<li><b>Exploring Workday AI Marketplace and Extend App Innovation</b><br /><a href="https://www.workday.com/en-ch/why-workday/workday-build.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday Build</a><br />Objective: Leverage Sana’s tech and Workday AI Marketplace to deliver tailored, AI-powered apps within 90 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Launch formal enablement sessions for Deloitte Workday teams on integrating Sana-driven agentic AI.</li>
<li>Connect with Portal26 and similar AI governance vendors for pilots and partnership exploration.</li>
<li>Document practical guidance on SAP-Snowflake-WD hybrid architectures for enterprise clients.</li>
<li>Develop executive briefing paper for Workday’s FY26 Q3 earnings release, focusing on AI and agentic roadmap.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks & Mitigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Risk:</b> Client confusion amid competing AI/agent launches by major vendors.<br /><b>Mitigation:</b> Provide actionable, vendor-agnostic guidance and scenario planning for clients. Establish Deloitte as an advisor navigating the ecosystem’s rapid changes.</li>
<li><b>Risk:</b> Regulatory and reputational exposure from ungoverned AI agent rollouts.<br /><b>Mitigation:</b> Adopt and promote best-in-class governance frameworks, and ensure responsible AI training across relevant teams.</li>
</ul>

These events intensify competition for AI-driven HR and finance platforms and set a new pace for autonomous enterprise workflows.\&quot;,\n  \&quot;highlights\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;Workday Finalizes Acquisition of Sana (Nov 4, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;On November 4, 2025, Workday formally completed its acquisition of Sana, an AI-native app platform. The deal strengthens Workday’s strategy to accelerate delivery of autonomous enterprise applications by embedding generative and agentic AI capabilities into its core HCM and Finance suites, as well as into Workday Extend and the Workday AI Marketplace. Sana&#x27;s technology is expected to boost Workday&#x27;s ecosystem by enabling customers and partners—including those piloting Deloitte-managed implementations—to rapidly develop AI-powered, context-aware workplace solutions such as knowledge assistants and recommendation engines.\\n\\nStrategically, this move positions Workday to compete more directly with Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow, who have each made recent investments in similar agentic AI frameworks and apps. For Deloitte’s Workday practice and joint clients, Sana’s low-code and composable AI approach will unlock new opportunities for rapid prototyping, automation of knowledge workflows, and custom domain-specific agent deployments within the Workday tenant. Workday’s announcement underlines its intent to remain at the front of the agentic SaaS evolution, with implications for how partners build and differentiate their value-added services in the expanding AI-powered Workday ecosystem.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-04-Workday-Completes-Acquisition-of-Sana\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;SAP and Snowflake Announce AI Data Interoperability and Agentic AI Capabilities (Nov 4, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;SAP and Snowflake jointly announced major advances around AI-powered enterprise data connectivity and governed agentic AI at SAP TechEd 2025. The new partnership enables SAP data to flow natively into Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud, with features like zero-copy data sharing, enhanced security, and built-in agentic AI services. These announcements include the general availability of Cortex AISQL operators and the launch of Snowflake Intelligence, which brings trusted, explainable, and compliant agentic AI to enterprise workflows.\\n\\nTechnically, the SAP-Snowflake alignment addresses a historical limitation for enterprise HR and finance systems—unlocking AI at scale while ensuring data governance. For Workday (and Deloitte’s delivery teams), the implication is twofold: clients will expect similar levels of data fabric and AI extensibility in Workday, and GSIs will need to upskill around new interoperability patterns, particularly for clients running hybrid SAP/Workday footprints. The partnership’s focus on agentic AI also presages a future where autonomous digital agents can orchestrate complex cross-platform business processes, challenging Workday and its ecosystem to deliver an equally agile experience.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/sap-snowflake-partnership-ai-data-cloud\&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      \&quot;headline\&quot;: \&quot;AI-Driven Governance Platform Portal26 Raises $9M (Nov 4, 2025)\&quot;,\n      \&quot;why_it_matters\&quot;: \&quot;Portal26, an emerging platform for AI application governance, announced a $9 million funding round. The company’s tools focus on autonomous monitoring, risk detection, and compliance across AI-powered business software—including SaaS HR and finance platforms. As generative and agentic AI move into high-stakes enterprise scenarios, governance and responsible AI are now seen as must-have capabilities, not afterthoughts.\\n\\nThis trend signals growing customer and regulator expectations for transparency, auditing, and policy management over AI workflows in environments like Workday, SAP, or Oracle Cloud. For Deloitte’s Workday team, proactive enablement around AI governance—and early involvement with compliance tooling vendors like Portal26—will become a differentiator in enterprise adoption cycles. The rise of specialized AI governance vendors also heightens competitive pressure on Workday and its ecosystem to deliver embedded, out-of-the-box trust and compliance for all agentic capabilities.\&quot;,\n      \&quot;source_url\&quot;: \&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/04/portal26-nabs-9m-ai-application-governance-platform\&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  \&quot;competitive_watch\&quot;: [\n    {\n      \&quot;competitor\&quot;: \&quot;SAP\&quot;,\n      \&quot;move\&quot;: \&quot;Launched new AI data interoperability, agentic AI models, and zero-copy features with Snowflake.
